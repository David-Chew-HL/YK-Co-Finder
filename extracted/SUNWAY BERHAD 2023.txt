programme, Sunway joins a host of 
leading global brands in charting a 
path towards net zero by 2050.

OUR STRATEGY OUR STRATEGYSunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023 Sunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023
OUR BUSINESS MODEL
In creating values, Sunway utilises 
a Build, Own, Operate (“BOO”) 
business model. In essence, assets 
are built, owned and operated by the 
Group to achieve financial returns 
as well as create various other non-
financial values. These include 
socio-economic and environmental 
outcomes as per the Group’s Vision, 
Mission and its sustainability goals 
which are aligned to the United 
Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (“SDGs”).
The Group utilises its design and construction 
capabilities to develop a wide range of 
infrastructure assets. These assets are either 
developed for project owners, in which case 
Sunway derives project management and 
construction/development fees or developed 
and later sold for revenues. In many cases, 
assets are developed to be owned by the Group 
towards generating recurring income streams 
and to ensure the creation of desired strategic 
value creation outputs and outcomes. 
This approach is exemplified in the development 
and ownership of specific retail, healthcare, 
leisure and hospitality assets, which in turn 
complement and support the development of 
the Group’s townships. The ownership of these 
assets sees Sunway also operating these assets 
towards ensuring effective management that 
delivers the desired value creation results, and 
in fulfilling specific strategic objectives. 
In ensuring the seamless execution of the BOO 
business model, Sunway’s capabilities are 
augmented by its access to resources, materials, 
skills and assets, and synergies provided through 
the Group’s various business divisions. 
By constantly incorporating the views of 
stakeholders into the overall strategy mix, 
adopting technology and innovation to deliver 
increased efficiencies and constantly seeking 
to provide solutions to emerging and existing 
challenges, the BOO model is continuously 
revitalised and improved on. The model is 
designed to be robust, competitive and is 
premised on the simple focus of “what value do 
we create” and “how can we generate financial 
and business returns while serving the society”.

BUILD AND MANAGE
Sunway constructs assets owned by others and post-
completion, manages the said assets for a stipulated 
period.
This approach involves SunCon together with other divisions 
that undertake asset management and operations, though 
the asset is not owned by the Group.
Sunway designs and builds assets owned by others and 
the Group collects project management and construction 
income. 
Primarily undertaken by SunCon, the Group’s Construction 
division. SunCon designs and builds assets for others, but 
is increasingly also progressing into asset management 
and ownership.
BUILD FOR OTHERS
Sunway designs and builds assets that are owned and 
thereafter managed by the Group. 
Management of these assets are aimed at providing specific 
services or enabling Sunway to venture and establish its 
presence in selected industries. Divisions involved include 
Leisure, Hospitality, Property Investment and REIT and 
Healthcare.
Sunway constructs properties and sells the properties for 
revenue and retains selected assets for recurring income to 
support a sustainable community/township. 
Primarily involves Sunway’s Property Development 
division, where landbank is developed into townships or 
standalone developments.

SUNWAY CITY: EXEMPLIFYING ALL ASPECTS OF THE SUNWAY BOO MODEL
The Sunway BOO model is apparent across the Group’s business operations, both in Malaysia 
and abroad. In particular, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur (“SCKL”) typifies how Sunway’s BOO 
model has and continues to create value for five decades. 
Despite being a matured township, SCKL continues to grow and reinvent itself to stay current and 
desirable to a wide range of stakeholders. The township serves society – integrating all necessary 
components to support high-quality urban living. It also continues to be a nexus for commercial 
and business activities that generates economic values and growth. By catering to both business 
and living considerations, SCKL continues to evolve and remains relevant over time.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES VALUES CREATED
Masterplanning 
Sustainable 
Community 
Based 
Developments
Sustaining and creating value is 
mindfully driven by a conscious focus 
and purpose, where consideration for 
all capitals and society is thoughtfully 
planned towards enabling relevance 
well into the future. This calls for 
masterplanning and conceptualising 
a township that deliver not just 
properties but also enables place 
making, liveability and a virtuous 
cycle of unlocking potential and 
continued development.
By developing property development projects, the 
business model re-envisions the future and ushers a 
new landscape of immense possibilities. These include 
unlocking land values, driving capital appreciation 
for properties and land, enabling urban regeneration, 
revitalising local economies, creating job and economic 
opportunities, and more. 
Excellent 
Accessibility 
and Connectivity 
SCKL provides excellent road 
infrastructure, public transportation, 
and connectivity to promote 
sustainable mobility and efforts 
toward reducing carbon emissions.
Affordable and conveniently accessed transportation 
is a democratic solution towards addressing urban 
challenges and requirements. It is the facilitating 
network that connects communities with economic 
opportunities, supports lifestyle aspirations and delivers 
much-needed sustainable mobility that enables a 
township to thrive and for society to function effectively 
on a daily basis. 
Landmark 
Destination
A preferred destination for retail, 
hospitality, leisure and commercial 
activities. These vibrant properties 
and theme park create synergistic 
benefits to one another.
Townships require more than just homes, jobs and 
mobility. A self-sustaining township meets the 
community’s needs for entertainment, recreational 
activities and retail requirements. These serve to 
provide desired commercial and lifestyle elements 
that complete/enhance the appeal proposition of the 
township. 
Job Creation Businesses in SCKL ecosystem 
create job opportunities which has 
a substantial economic multiplier 
effect. Sunway helps to contribute 
to nation-building directly and 
indirectly.
Creating and sustaining diverse employment 
opportunities stimulate local economic growth and 
support income levels for local communities. The 
ecosystem attracts business and drives commercial 
enterprise and activities which contribute to the 
overall momentum of activity in the township.
World-Class 
Quality 
Healthcare
One of the leading private quaternary 
medical care centres in the country. 
Access to world-class quality 
healthcare and poised to set the 
standard of healthcare services 
through its expansion to serve the 
local communities and growing 
demand for medical tourism.
Medical and healthcare components cater to the growing 
needs of local communities. This elevates the quality 
of life, promotes wellness, contributes to healthier 
communities and potentially supports the needs of the 
communities as they age over time. 
Advancing 
Innovation
New innovations such as urban 
farming, “green” building 
technologies, and more contribute 
to an eco-friendlier township 
and promote a degree of self-
sufficiency in the long term.
Technology enables the township to constantly 
reinvent itself, to adopt new and improved ideas and 
approaches to unlock and enhance value creation. The 
application of technology further reduces environmental 
footprint, increases convenience for communities and 
stakeholders, pioneers new possibilities and supports 
the concept of a self-sustaining township well into the 
future. 
The Green Lung The natural environment of “blue” 
and “green” is treasured as providing 
a tranquil sanctuary amidst urban 
development. The green lungs help 
in regulating the city’s temperature 
naturally.
The consideration for preserving the natural environment 
places nature as a central aspect of placemaking. 
Nature continues to thrive, providing a heat and carbon 
sink, creating green spaces for communities to enjoy 
and reinforces the message that natural capitals are to 
be retained and restored for a more sustainable future.

OUR BUSINESS MODELOUR BUSINESS MODEL
EMULATING THE THRIVING TOWNSHIP MODEL AT SUNWAY CITY ISKANDAR PUTERI
Leveraging Sunway’s integrated and synergistic capabilities, a new bustling, vibrant 
metropolis continues to take shape since its inception in 2012. At Sunway City Iskandar 
Puteri (“SCIP”), a fledgling concept progressively manifests over 1,800 acres of landbank, 
into a fast-growing, high quality liveable township. As it expands, SCIP progressively delivers 
all necessary components for a highly desirable lifestyle and more.
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES VALUES CREATED
Placing Nature 
at the Heart 
of Urban Town 
Planning 
SCIP’s masterplan calls for the 
preservation of 40% or 720 acres of 
land from development. A ’wildlife 
sanctuary’ and special buffer zones are 
created to protect both flora and fauna.
The retention of the natural 144 acres of 
mangrove forest feature alongside a seven 
kilometre Pendas River serves as a carbon 
and heat sink. The mangrove forests serve as 
a natural filter as well as provide protection 
against floods and rising sea water levels.
Provision of 
Infrastructure, 
Amenities and 
Facilities 
SCIP was developed to benefit from 
the expanding road and rail network 
in Johor and the surrounding area. 
The township was designed with direct 
connectivity to highways, enabling ease 
of travel. 
Ease of travel and its connectivity encourages 
the use of public transportation as well as 
reduces potential traffic congestion, thus 
enabling reduction in vehicular emissions and 
minimising unproductive travel time. 
Integrated transportation infrastructure meets 
a fundamental requirement that supports 
commercial, industrial and retail activities. 
Growing Retail 
and Commercial 
Presence within 
the Precinct 
As SCIP takes shape, a key growth driver 
is the presence of various commercial, 
lifestyle, business and entertainment 
components, strategically placed to 
meet the needs of the township’s 
growing population.
The commercial and retail elements create jobs, 
drives business activities, meets and enhances 
lifestyle aspirations and contributes to the 
placemaking value proposition of the township. 
These elements provide potential residential 
property buyers with the confidence to make this 
township their home. 
In addition, commercial elements support 
capital appreciation of properties. 
Completing 
the Value 
Proposition with 
Educational 
and Healthcare 
Elements
SCIP was built to sustain a local 
populace over the long-term, hence 
the inclusion of other social-based 
amenities such as schools, medical 
facilities and more. 
These essential aspects of town-making serve 
to provide easy access to high-quality education 
and healthcare facilities for the local community. 
Sunway’s BOO model enables the Group to 
build and operate these facilities, which in turn 
provides recurring income opportunities for the 
Group. 
Creating an 
Established 
Residential 
Community 
through Quality 
Homes
The provision of various types of 
residential properties aims not to just 
sell houses, but to develop a thriving, 
sustainable community, which is the 
foundation for any township to succeed. 
Attracting and retaining residents 
is part of the placemaking process 
to ensuring a sufficient population 
to support the township’s long-term 
growth. 
Homes provided enable buyers to meet their 
lifestyle aspirations for quality living. Homes 
provide the benefits of capital appreciation, a 
sense of security and also enables residents to 
benefit from the continued growth and value of 
SCIP as its development unfolds over several 
phases. 
Attracting 
Sustainable 
Investments and 
Developments 
that Redefine 
Value Creation
Heralding the next wave of sustainable, 
eco-based development, SCIP 
continues to attract new investments 
and development concepts. Among 
these is Equalbase Sunway 103°, a 
sustainable, Free Commercial Zone for 
the logistics industry. 
Sunway and Equalbase will jointly 
develop Equalbase Sunway 103°, 
the first fully carbon-neutral free 
commercial zone in SCIP, Johor.
Beyond the usual values of job creation, 
investment inflows and business opportunities 
for local communities, Equalbase Sunway 103° 
sets a precedent that distinguishes the SCIP 
brand. 
It signals to the world of the innovative thinking 
and commitment to sustainable development 
that serves to attract other forward-looking 
investments. It also contributes to the 
preservation of natural capitals and is a direct 
strategy in addressing climate change.

OUR BUSINESS MODEL
SUSTAINING VALUE AND ENSURING RELEVANCE OF THE BUSINESS MODEL THROUGH INTEGRATED THINKING
Investments into ESG, ultimately 
support the business model either 
directly or indirectly. This alludes 
to specific ESG topics defined and 
selected by Sunway as well as general 
or larger causes.
The generation of financial values 
supports ESG and CSR initiatives, 
allowing capital to be channelled to 
various societal and environmental 
causes.
For example, the focus on decarbonisation strategies do not just reduce carbon emissions and provides a cleaner more sustainable 
future, it allays against rising energy costs. 
The development of social amenities and affordable housing serves to provide quality housing that enables better living standards, 
access to better amenities and facilities and even fosters improved communal ties, at the same time ensures a sustainable property 
development model where revenues are driven by real market demand. 
The provision of affordable homes is equally important to prevent and reduce distortion in market supply and demand dynamics.  
It contributes to the overall supply amidst rising demand for affordable, quality housing from a growing middle-income mass 
segment of Malaysians. These addresses rising prices and ensures that properties remain within the reach of the buying public, 
which then enables property developers to continue launching properties into the market. 
These features are well reflected through the thriving township of Sunway City Kuala Lumpur and in the future, Sunway City Iskandar 
Puteri.
The implementation of the ESG 
initiatives and Sunway’s Sustainability 
agenda will ultimately deliver the 
desired positive impacts to the 
realisation of SDGs.
An organisation’s continued ability to be relevant, resilient and competitive is premised on its 
ability to sustain and drive business and operational performance, but at the same time, serving as 
a positive force that continuously delivers positive social and environmental impacts that contribute 
to shared prosperity and the realisation of the SDGs.

OUR APPROACH TO VALUE CREATION
A DYNAMIC MARKET DRIVEN MODEL
LINKING BUSINESS STRATEGIES WITH FINANCIAL AND IMPACT MATERIALITY
Sunway’s BOO business model does not exist in a vacuum and Sunway is cognisant that its ability to create financial and non-financial 
values can be significantly influenced by a wide range of factors. These include external trends and developments, stakeholders’ 
perceptions and demands and a natural environment that continues to come under immense and immediate pressure such as 
climate change, biodiversity loss, deforestation and more.
Non-financial Financial Stakeholders
Present global/macro external challenges impacting value creation and the business model
Growing non-financial/ESG matters 
that affect organisations and value 
creation
Shareholders’ demands, capital 
allocation, cashflows, revenue and 
earnings growth, ROI and ROE
Their aspirations and concerns 
on present global/macro external 
challenges
Given the intrinsic connection between financial and non-financial considerations, Sunway continues to strive for cognisance of the 
many intricate relationships between both aspects, and to leverage such insights towards adopting a suitable strategic positioning; 
one that would enable the Group to navigate its external operating environment, meet the evolving demands of stakeholders while 
delivering business and operational performance. The principle elements are:
Exploring mergers and acquisitions 
opportunities and overseas 
expansion
Improving cost management and 
enhancing operational efficiency
Talent management and 
development
Optimising innovation and 
technologies to accelerate growth
Maximising value and synergy from 
the Sunway brand and increased 
harnessing of business and 
operational synergy

OUR STRATEGY OUR STRATEGYSunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023 Sunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023
The focus on climate change is indeed driven by the urgency to address the many and adverse impacts of climate change on our physical, 
our environment and our society. 
Impacts such as rising sea water levels, increasing temperatures, drought and flash floods continue to be core themes upon which Sunway 
as a responsible business continues to pay close attention to. The distinction, however, is that Sunway’s focus on these and other climate 
related impacts are not just on how society and the natural environment is affected, but also in terms of the impacts on Sunway’s BOO 
model and the operations of the Group’s various business divisions. In short, climate change continues to be regarded from both impact and 
financial materiality perspectives. 
Driven by this integrated thinking perspective, the drive to reduce carbon emissions as per Sunway’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 
Roadmap is not just driven by the desire to realise a greener and cleaner future for posterity, but also in ensuring the business remains 
resilient, ready and competitive to operate in a new zero carbon business environment going forward.
Given that climate change is arguably, the world’s single most existential macro-trend affecting our planet, the focus on developing 
(and implementing) a comprehensive and strategic pathway enables a systematic approach to effectively navigate the various risks and 
opportunities arising from climate change.

ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY
Throughout Sunway’s 50-year journey, the Group has been at the forefront of generating, sustaining and enhancing both financial and non-
financial values. This is evident, notably in Sunway’s transformation of a derelict tin mining area into a model, urban township, Sunway 
City Kuala Lumpur. The urban regeneration success story typifies the Sunway business philosophy of creating positive values. The township 
demonstrates the Group’s ability to harness business and operational synergies; leveraging the respective core competencies of its business 
divisions towards successfully undertaking urban renewal on an unparalleled scale and sustaining the vibrance and relevance of the 
township well into the future. 
The value creation approach conceptualised 50 years ago holds true till today and continued to be reinvented and revitalised through new 
ideas, technological development, social/market trends and increasingly, focus on environmental impacts and performance.
The Group measures its performance against the targets set within the 2030 Sustainability Goals to enable the Group to meet stakeholders’ 
expectations and to ensure that the Group make reasonable efforts to mitigate its environmental impacts, empower the people and 
community, and uphold robust governance practices. The Sustainability Scorecard tracks and reports the Group’s progress annually in the 
Sustainability Report.
Sunway’s sustainability goals are premised on delivering value to society and safeguarding the environment and resources. This mindset or 
consciousness have always been a mainstay of the Sunway business philosophy since its inception five decades ago. It is this approach of 
linking purpose with profit that continues to drive Sunway onward. The focus on defining value beyond financial metrics and acknowledging 
the linkages between non-financial capitals to business and operational results remains pivotal to the Sunway Build, Own, Operate (“BOO”) 
business model.

CLIMATE ACTION: NET ZERO BY 2050 (CONTD.)
All business divisions are tasked to reduce their emissions and to strive towards realising Net Zero 2050. Presently, the Group is on 
track towards achieving its immediate milestone 2030 targets. 
Sunway has identified its principal physical and transition risks on the Group’s business operations. These include acute and chronic 
business and operational risks based on short, medium and long-term perspectives based on the TCFD framework. 
Methodologies for quantification of financial impacts continue to be developed based on cost, environmental and social impact 
considerations over the short, medium and long-term horizons.
Notes:
1  Severe floods and landslides have historically been observed to affect Sunway’s portfolio of property and production assets; however, they are not frequent. Moving forward, 
climate change will cause the frequency of these acute extreme weather events to increase.
2 In Malaysia, mandatory regulations on green buildings and green construction products are not likely in the short term. 
3 Climate transition technology applicable to the construction supply chain ranges from mature technology that is currently commercially available (e.g. LED lights, solar panels) 
to commercial technologies in the medium term (e.g. hydrogen-powered heavy machinery) to commercial technologies in the long term (e.g. carbon capture and storage).
4  We take the view that in Malaysia, consumers and stakeholders in society (e.g. the government, investors, NGOs) already have preferences for green products and services; 
however, this is still at a nascent stage and not yet comprehensively embraced.

Developing 
comprehensive 
oversight 
on sources 
of energy 
consumed and 
accurate carbon 
baselines
The ongoing exercise in identifying all sources of energy consumed across the business process (and related 
costs) provides business divisions a clearer and precise understanding of the following: 
• What aspects of its operations are the largest consumers of energy
• What energy sources are consumed and how these can be addressed both from environmental impact and 
cost efficiency perspectives.
These may entail undertaking energy audits, accurate and more comprehensive data collection of energy 
consumed, measured not just in costs spent but also in quantities i.e. litres, MWh and kWH. 
Rawang and Hulu Langat sites of the Quarry division and Sunway Putra Hotel from the Hospitality division 
received the Malaysian Government Energy Audit Conditional Grant to conduct energy audits in their sites. 
The grant will be a catalyst for the identification and implementation of a comprehensive 3-year energy 
improvement plan for the respective sites.
Pursuing 
measures to 
drive increased 
energy 
consumption 
efficiency and 
transitioning to 
more sustainable 
alternatives
The general principle is to achieve reduced energy consumption (improved efficiency) and switching to 
cleaner energy sources i.e. electricity sourced from the grid or RE sources.
Some measures include switching to electric powered forklifts from diesel powered forklifts, reducing idle 
time of machinery and equipment to save fuel and reduce electricity consumption and undertaking regular 
maintenance activities. Others include adoption of LED lightings.
Undertaking 
large scale 
decarbonisation 
of operations 
through 
renewable 
energy (“RE”) 
implementation
A highly effective approach is to undertake large scale transition to RE alternatives i.e. solar installations 
to reduce dependence on grid-sourced electricity. However, such transition must be balanced against cost 
considerations. The short-term outlay of CAPEX needs to be considered against medium and long-term costs 
savings as well as potential risk mitigation against carbon taxes if any or any embodied carbon restrictions 
placed on export products.
Through its construction arm, Sunway is also well placed to enable external stakeholders to implement solar 
and other RE energy systems towards reducing their overall carbon footprint and to reduce energy costs. 
Supply chain 
decarbonisation
In delivering a more profound impact, all business divisions continue to cascade their approach to suppliers 
across the supply chain. Essentially, vendors, business partners and others are now being tasked to develop 
their energy profiles and GHG inventories accordingly. This would start a process of decarbonisation that 
would progressively culminate in “greener” supply chains. 
Sunway’s Environmental Product Declaration (“EPD”) journey has commenced with the development of 
Product Carbon Footprint (“PCF”) profiles for the Building Materials and Quarry divisions. The selection of 
these business divisions is based on the fact that these divisions produce a large number of the raw materials 
and natural capitals consumed by other business divisions, i.e. Construction, Property Development and 
others.
Other divisions are being encouraged to work with major suppliers / principals, towards collection of electricity 
and other available data on major energy sources consumed. This would enable a more comprehensive carbon 
profile to emerge.
Addressing 
unavoidable 
emissions 
through 
carbon offset 
mechanisms
It is possible, that despite the best efforts of the Group, fugitive and residual emissions may still exist, hence, 
offset mechanisms as a last resort can be utilised towards realising Net Zero 2050.
ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY ADVANCING SUSTAINABILITY
OUR BROAD BASED STRATEGIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
CONTRIBUTING TO WATER SECURITY 
The strategies in response to the identified risks and opportunities include the following:
Further information on the Group’s energy and emissions profile are provided in Sustainability Report 2023.
Further information on the Group’s water security profile are provided in Sustainability Report 2023. 
Increasingly, water resources and access to water continues to face immense pressure from rising consumption demand, 
inefficient use i.e. wastages in the system and existential factors such as climate change. The risks posed by water shortage, 
however, leads to opportunities in driving water efficiency, developing alternative water sources and also how such alternatives 
can contribute to improvements in terms of the financial bottom line.
All relevant business divisions in Sunway have upped their focus towards ensuring operational water security, guided by the 
Group’s Water Management Policy to enhance water security and manage water consumption and disruptions efficiently, 
reducing use of potable water for non-potable uses where possible and having more than one water source. This includes the 
development of water consumption scenarios in the event of acute and prolonged disruptions, chronic situations of undersupply 
or lack of access and more. 
Sources of water
In 2023, the total 
water consumption was 
5,256,734 m3, where 
27% (1,412,855 m 3) of 
the consumption is sourced 
from non-municipal water 
supply.
LAKE WATER
WATER TREATMENT PLANT
Water from our treatment plant is treated using 
a hybrid of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis 
processes to meet the quality standards of  
potable drinking water.
The water treatment plant in Sunway City Kuala 
Lumpur supplies water to various commercial 
and residential buildings within the township. 
The Sunway South Quay lake has been used 
as a water catchment area since 2019. Our 
RM18 million water treatment plant converts 
excess water into potable water and directs it 
to our buildings as an alternative water source. 
This has helped us to rely less on municipal 
water supply and serves as backup water supply 
during water shortages.
LANDSCAPING
We also extract water from the Sunway 
South Quay lake for the purpose of township 
landscape watering.
Water withdrawn from municipal sources 
are assured of their quality and is compliant 
with the Drinking Water Quality Standards, 
published by the Ministry of Health (MOH). 
Air Selangor, one of our municipal water 
source, regularly monitors the quality of raw 
and treated water at various sampling points, 
through in-house laboratories which have 
been accredited with ISO 17025 (Laboratory 
Accreditation) Certification.
We ensure that we consume water efficiently 
through:
MUNICIPAL POTABLE WATER
Water-saving initiatives
All business operations within the Group 
must actively participate in reducing 
water consumption to conserve water. 
Among the water saving initiatives 
implemented are installing motion sensor 
taps and waterless urinals, conducting 
regular checking of tap and pipe leakages 
and increasing public awareness about 
water conservation.
Water Crisis SOP
Every Sunway-managed property has 
a water crisis SOP in place to address 
water disruptions effectively. It covers 
emergency planning to mitigate water 
disruptions should they occur during 
business operating hours.
We also withdraw water from various alternative 
sources for non-essential activities that do not require 
the quality standards of potable drinking water such 
as landscaping and cleaning. This is to conserve water 
consumption from the potable water supply.
RAINWATER HARVESTING
We have installed rainwater harvesting tanks 
at our properties for activities such as cleaning 
outdoor areas, maintaining landscapes and 
flushing toilets.
GROUNDWATER 
In Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, the groundwater is 
used for cleaning common walkways and watering 
the landscape.

WASTE MANAGEMENT (CIRCULAR ECONOMY)
Beyond reducing waste produced and 
sent to disposals, the implementation 
of circular economy approach offers 
significant opportunities for value 
creation. Potential cost savings can be 
derived from more efficient resource 
consumption, reduced wastages and 
reduced requirement for waste storage 
and disposal.
Waste to Energy
At the same time, Waste to Energy 
solutions, enable not just reduced 
costs, but also the prospect of revenue 
generation from the sales of waste. 
The Hospitality division 
collaborated with 
FatHopes Energy 
to repurpose used 
cooking oil (“UCO”) 
generated from daily 
cooking and operations. 
The collection of UCO has helped 
significantly in reducing the strain 
on the sewer system and preventing 
environmental contamination. The 
Sunway community and residents were 
encouraged to contribute their UCO to 
FatHopes Energy in exchange for cash 
rewards facilitated through Sunway Super

influencing turnover, satisfaction and employee related 
indicators, the continued effort in addressing all aspects of 
the talent management – recruitment, retention, reward and 
remuneration, training and development as well as career 
pathway development yields significant positives for Sunway. 
The comprehensive approach to talent has been cascaded and 
implemented across all business divisions.

HARNESSING COLLABORATION TO ENHANCE  
OUR VALUE CHAIN 
As Sunway continues to focus on its own operations, the Group increasingly looks to expand its efforts towards downstream and 
upstream stakeholders. Upstream stakeholders typically comprise supply chains, while downstream mainly comprises customers, 
clients and other end product/service users.
The group can play a role in addressing environmental and social impacts occurring outside of its direct operational control, 
which have a bearing on financial and business performance. This is essential in achieving most of its value creation goals 
as well as being successful in respect of decarbonisation, waste management, smart building development, sustainable 
consumption and more. 
Effectively addressing impacts which the Group is indirectly responsible for is vital towards truly achieving net zero carbon, 
mitigating physical and transition risks associated with climate change and developing greener supply chains.
Developing improved insulation from supply chain risks such as non-compliant suppliers which could lead to fines or 
penalties to the Group, tarnished reputation and other negative impacts.
The strategic thinking of stakeholders’ inclusion in the value creation journey centres on the following considerations: 
Carbon emissions is an example that 
demonstrates the importance of supply 
chain engagement and collaboration. 
While an organisation can typically 
address Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
there is the challenge of addressing Scope 
3 emissions. Tracking Scope 3 can be 
challenging simply due to the lack of 
oversight, support and data on supply 
chains as the bulk of emissions which 
an organisation is responsible for, mainly 
emanates from its supply chains. 
At Sunway, we have established an 
embodied carbon emissions roadmap to 
guide us in the declaration of the Product 
Carbon Footprint (PCF) for the Building 
Materials and Quarry products by 2024. 
Subsequently, the divisions will prepare 
the Environmental Product Declaration 
(EPD) to ensure that its products have 
minimal negative environmental impacts.
Hence, in delivering the fullest impact, 
the value creation espoused by Sunway 
unequivocally requires extension to a wide 
range of stakeholders, principally, the 
supply chain and consumers/customers/ 
clients.

GOING BEYOND GOOD GOVERNANCE CUSTOMER COLLABORATION TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY
Often, companies’ efforts on the supply chain management centre on governance i.e. ensuring adherence to environmental and 
social regulatory compliance. However, Sunway’s efforts as implemented by its business divisions aside from good governance, 
is to drive cost and operational benefits and to ensure access, availability and affordability of goods and services. A further 
focus is transitioning to more eco-friendly selection of materials, which also requires customer buy-in and support.

Sustainable Construction Materials 
In our journey towards constructing 
sustainable and green developments, 
buildings and townships, we integrate 
sustainable construction materials into our 
developments. Sustainable buildings are the 
future of construction, as they have minimal 
environmental impact and lower cost of 
building operations. 
We use alternative 
materials that are 
environmentally 
friendly, such as 
recyclable raw 
materials, which 
also reduce the 
carbon footprint of material sourcing and 
ensuring the durability of the materials. 
Certified green building products have also 
been selected when choosing materials 
and fittings for development. These include 
waterproofing, skim coating, timber flooring 
and the materials used for the ceiling, 
tiles, paints, pavers and others. The usage 
of these materials vary with the different 
developments.
Purchase of Eco-label Products
Sunway’s malls source toilet paper 
exclusively from Forest Stewardship 
Council (“FSC”)-managed forests and 
FSC-certified mills. This dedication 
contributes to the preservation of a 
sustainable cycle, ensuring responsible 
harvesting and replanting practices that 
uphold the ecological balance of the 
forests.
100% 
projects use green 
and/or recycled 
materials in ongoing 
developments
In 2023, more than 
231 million 
sheets of paper purchased were 
FSC-certified
Sustainable Products
Within our Building Materials division, 
we integrate an innovative selection of 
environmentally conscious products that 
adhere to eco-friendly label standards, 
such as SIRIM ECO 023:2016 and SIRIM 
ECO 033:2019. All our building materials 
strictly adhere to the specifications 
outlined in MS1380, MS1314 and 
MS1601.
Furthermore, our operational sites for the 
Building Materials division have earned 
ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications, 
underscoring our commitment to 
delivering products, services and systems 
of exceptional quality, safety and 
efficiency. 
Our eco-friendly offerings include 
Environmental Pavers, which is recognised 
as a MyHIJAU green-certified product in 
Malaysia. It holds the prestigious Green 
Label certificate in Singapore. Another 
noteworthy product is NeuPave, a water-
permeable paver designed to mitigate 
flooding, encourage groundwater recharge, 
and prevent soil erosion.
The launch of the Green Lease Partnership Programme by Sunway REIT in 2022 marked a new approach in involving and rewarding 
tenants for participating in the journey towards practicing more sustainable business practices. The onset of Green Lease Partnership 
Programme, essentially mandates tenants to adhere to, or achieve mutually agreed ESG performance goals, which then entitles them 
to specific benefits. 
To Sunway, the benefits include reduced environmental footprint that brings the Group closer to realising its net zero carbon goal, the 
progressive transformation of more assets into green assets (which then enables the Group to leverage green financing and various 
other business advantages) and achieve reduced energy and other costs, including resource consumption and maintenance costs.
 
This reflects the pertinence of working closely with our tenants through collaborations and partnerships to minimise our environmental 
footprint and adopt responsible resource management, as we advance towards net zero.
In 2023, the programme garnered the participation of:
100%
hotel 
master 
lessees
82%
retail and 
office 
tenants
The Retail and Commercial segments 
and the Hospitality division actively 
participate in the programme to 
promote adoption of international 
best practices in sustainability. 
It is just one example of how 
Sunway leverages social capital i.e. 
stakeholder engagement to continue 
creating value and to accelerate 
progress on its path to net zero.
Further information on the Group’s sustainability upstream and downstream engagements initiatives are provided in Sustainability Report 2023. 
Sustainability Collaboration Alliance 
Network (SCAN) is a five-way partnership 
linked up with United Nations 
Sustainable Development Solutions 
Network (SDSN), Jeffrey Sachs Center 
on Sustainable Development at Sunway 
University (JSC), Malaysia Retail 
Association (MRA), and Malaysia Retail 
Chain Association (MRCA).
SCAN is the first alliance network 
in Malaysia to solely focus on 
sustainability in the retail industry. Its 
aim is to encourage environmentally 
responsible practices while nurturing a 
thriving business community.
With the essential stakeholders of mall 
operators, retailers and sustainability 
experts under SCAN, a 3-tier learning 
programme, known as ReX (Retail 
Extended Learning) has been curated 
to bring sustainability awareness to 
stakeholders within the retail industry.

OPTIMISING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGIES TO 
ACCELERATE GROWTH
Technology remains a purveyor, enabler and catalyst for value creation. The role of technology grows in pervasiveness as technology 
serves in enhancing the effectiveness of existing strategies and enabling new strategic approaches. Technology combined with 
facilitative mechanisms such as skilled human capital, supportive systems and infrastructure and budgetary allocations can provide 
significant shifts in value creation across all capitals. 
Technology is not without its drawbacks as wrong selection of technology or ineffective implementation could lead to values being 
eroded or inability to achieve the desired outcomes. Nevertheless, technology retains its significant potential benefits to the business 
model. Sunway continues to adopt necessary mitigation measures to pare down risks while leveraging the immense potential that 
artificial intelligence (“AI”), Big Data Analytics (“BDA”), Internet of Things, Federated Learning, Blockchain and digitalisation 
brings to all business divisions. 
DIGITALISING OUR VALUE (SUPPLY) CHAIN
Digitalisation of the supply chain enables improved traceability, allowing Sunway to track the point of origination of products/ 
services. This eventually promotes better understanding of related Scope 3 emissions and embodied carbon of products and services 
and the ability to ascertain the sustainability credentials of sourced products and services. 
Digitalisation automates data collection and disclosures, provides clear internal processes and controls, and creates a transparent 
information environment. From this, a wide range of insights and strategic information can be accessed to support more informed 
and strategic decision making.
Digitalisation enables more real-time collection of information as well as communication. The system fosters closer interaction and 
collaboration between suppliers and Sunway, and with the greater emphasis on traceability and compliance, encourages the supply 
chain to also rethink their business approaches.
e-Invoicing
Since 2015, Sunway has transformed the 
manual process of supplier paper invoice 
handling into an automated and paperless 
accounts payable (AP) process solution. 
Further enhancement and revolutionary 
change was introduced in 2019 when Robotics 
Process Automation was embedded in the 
automated AP process. As such, we now have 
a fully automated AP solution that integrates 
Sunway’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
systems, enabling straightforward supplier 
invoicing and payment processing.
e-Applications 
Our organisation established 
e-Applications to shift from conventional 
filing system to online platforms. This not 
only cut down on rented space, but also 
increased productivity through seamless 
file retrieval systems as well as reduce the 
usage of paper.
e-Procurement
Sunway’s e-procurement system streamlines 
the electronic processing of all procurement-
related approvals and documents 
encompassing purchase requisitions (PR), 
purchase orders (PO), and goods received.
Additionally, the system features 
e-catalogues for Sunway users, facilitating 
the electronic purchase of items. It supports 
pre-negotiated pricing, thereby minimising 
the time required for users to locate 
frequently purchased items. This enables 
different business divisions to collectively 
leverage the advantages of volume 
purchases.
OPTIMISING INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH
PIONEERING A DIGITALISED APPROACH TO HEALTHCARE
SUNWAY SUPER APP – A LIFESTYLE COMPANION
REDESIGNING THE PROPERTY PURCHASE EXPERIENCE
While technology is pervasive in the field of healthcare, one 
distinctive approach adopted by Sunway Healthcare is the 
promotion of health screening packages online. On Sunway 
Medical Centre Velocity’s webpage, the hospital offers health 
screening packages which customers can select their desired 
health screening packages, make an appointment and have 
options to make payment immediately or to pay after they’ve 
been examined.
Sunway Super App is a loyalty programme that rewards 
customers with loyalty points and other special privileges on all 
spending from our participating merchants and selected Sunway 
businesses. Customers can enjoy privileges and redeem loyalty 
points at over 1,000 merchants at Sunway’s malls, theme parks, 
medical centres, properties, and other Sunway businesses. 
From virtual showrooms, digital marketing, electronic 
documentation and virtual property handovers as well as 
submission of defects and various aspects of property 
management, technology continues to reshape the property 
purchase process for both developers and buyers. The 
development is novel as it debunks perception that traditional 
brick and mortar processes such as buying properties cannot be 
successfully digitalised. 
Digitalisation reduces various costs associated with the property 
sales and purchase process. It enables swifter response, even 
customised approaches, while reducing the need for various 
hard copy documentation. 
Further information on the Group’s supply chain digitalisation 
initiatives are provided in Sustainability Report 2023.
More than 2,200 
health screening 
packages were sold 
in 2023, amounting 
to total sales of 
approximately 
RM2 million.

CREATING VALUE THROUGH 
NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES
As the world evolves and the future continues to change in tandem with present trends and developments, opportunities to rethink 
business conventions and develop new approaches and ideas continue to emerge. Sunway’s business divisions embraced this 
dynamic environment and continue to not just adapt, but also to optimise opportunities driven by evolved strategic thinking to create 
financial and non-financial values. 
DEVELOPING TOMORROW’S SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS
DEVELOPMENT OF HOMEGROWN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
REDEFINING AGED LIVING THROUGH SUNWAY SANCTUARY
Sunway Theme Parks’ Explorer Rangers programme was 
designed to meet society’s need for future sustainability 
leaders. The outdoor educational membership programme with 
Flexi Classes and Classes Alive for children aged 5-12 years, 
endorsed by the Education Ministry, was developed to inculcate 
not just a strong sense of environmental consciousness, but 
to also provide children with the knowledge to become future 
pioneers, trailblazers and to ultimately take on the mantle in 
charting a more sustainable path for the country and the world. 
Indirect contribution to a more 
enlightened and empowered 
society that will potentially 
support more sustainable 
choices and decision making 
towards delivering various 
socio-economic benefits
Promoting sustainability 
consciousness, indirectly

sustainability leaders for 
Malaysia
Since 2022, weekly educational wildlife classes are held at 
both theme parks’ locations: Sunway Lagoon at Sunway City 
Kuala Lumpur and Sunway Lost World of Tambun at Sunway 
City Ipoh. The programme had garnered over 500 active 
members and was renewed for another year in 2023 (Explorer 
Rangers 2.0).
CREATING VALUE THROUGH NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES
As the present operating environment necessitates/encourages rethinking of conventional business models and operational activities, 
it inevitably promotes the development of new business ideas and techniques. 
Notably, through the implementation of new technologies such as AI, BDA, Internet of Things, Federated Learning, Blockchain and 
more, it is highly feasible to envision and realise paradigm shifts in businesses. 
Such innovation can become the intellectual property of Sunway. To evolve from a follower into a technological creator and leader, 
investing into intellectual capitals is necessary, especially in maintaining a competitive edge in a globalised, competitive world.
Beyond just existing processes, technology will be used to develop new business and create new business possibilities which 
includes enhancing the thriving township concept. The utilisation of technology offers several advantages, but also carries inherent 
risks and may require substantial upfront investments and recurring costs.
In June 2023, Sunway Healthcare proudly launched Sunway Sanctuary, its flagship integrated senior living community in Sunway 
City Kuala Lumpur, marking a ground-breaking milestone in aged care and living. Situated adjacent to Sunway Medical Centre 
Sunway City, Sunway Sanctuary stands as Malaysia’s pioneering facility, seamlessly integrating healthcare and senior living to 
redefine standards in elderly care. Sunway Sanctuary provides elegant living lifestyle for seniors with thoughtful facilities, holistic 
wellness and curated experiences to cater to the needs of today’s affluent senior population. 
As Malaysia’s aged population grows, there is an increasing requirement for quality care facilities supported by sufficient, trained 
aged care professionals, which Malaysia presently continued to lack. Hence, the launch of Sunway Sanctuary is designed to meet 
the needs of an increasing ageing society, while creating new revenue streams.

Sunway continues to evolve with its external operating environment – creating 
new engines of growth. One of these is the emerging potentials of the Group’s 
Healthcare division, Sunway Healthcare Group (“Sunway Healthcare” or 
“SHG”). 
A confluence of socio-demographic factors, the rapid recovery in post 
pandemic medical tourism and growing societal awareness on the importance 
of healthcare to longevity and wellbeing have provided a significant impetus 
in the continued growth of the domestic and regional healthcare industry. 
SHG, given its long-standing and inherent positioning as a trusted healthcare 
provider is well poised to leverage the many opportunities coming to the fore 
for healthcare players. 
SHG’s strategy is to leverage on a hub and spoke approach to optimise 
opportunities towards further penetrating existing and new markets, both 
locally and abroad, driving patient acquisition and expanding market 
presence. Beyond rapidly building new hospitals in new locations, the focus 
is on emphasising the quality of healthcare, developing sufficient talents 
to support growth plans and establishing clear brand leadership amidst a 
competitive marketspace.
Capitalising on existing synergies within the Sunway Group further enhances 
SHG’s capability to develop medical tourism and wellness offerings by 
working with the Leisure and Hospitality divisions, as well as working with 
the Property Development and Construction divisions to plan and develop 
new hospitals and other healthcare facilities.

The hub and spoke business model address the entire healthcare ecosystem.  
The model leverages on the proven expertise, track record and capabilities of SMC 
Sunway City, which then enables the development of additional hospitals/medical 
facilities to bring the value proposition to new markets. This fuels customer 
acquisition, geographical expansion and brand exposure and development. SMC 
Sunway City is the nexus at the core of the hub and spoke model. The best practices 
and methodologies of the hospital serves as the solid bedrock upon which SHG 
would replicate in other hospitals, albeit with localised differences based on the 
requirements of the respective local communities.
The development of hospitals and specialist centres are aimed at providing a 
wide range of medical services and care, with each hospital within the network 
leveraging off the strengths of each other.
The hub and spoke business model delivers the following benefits:
 
√ Generate cross-referrals from network hospitals to boost utilisation and drive 
complex tertiary and quaternary care patients to SMC Sunway City.
√ Increase patient volumes from the network to attract top doctors.
√ Enhance synergies within the network through centralised operations. 
√ Appeals to insurance companies and corporate payors with its nationwide 
network. 
SHG has also focused on other healthcare niche sectors including ambulatory care 
centres (ACCs), home healthcare, fertility centres, senior living and alternative 
medical treatment options such as Traditional and Complementary Medicine. 
Besides that, SHG is poised to tap into the growing healthcare tourism sector 
which has regained its momentum post pandemic. Malaysia’s relatively affordable 
prices, infrastructure, quality of medical professionals and other facilitating factors 
continue to enable the country to emerge as a preferred destination for regional 
healthcare travellers. 
UNLOCKING SHARED VALUE 
One of the key aspects of Sunway’s BOO model is the unlocking of value, creating 
shared wealth creation for stakeholders and this is evident in the strong growth 
story of SHG. A model well proven with SunCon and Sunway REIT is the possibility 
of progressing to an initial public offering (“IPO”) for SHG, which would enable 
both institutional and retail investors to benefit from the Healthcare division’s 
growth story. 
Beyond serving as an exit or profit taking strategy, a prospective IPO as evident 
with SunCon and Sunway REIT drives the next phase of growth for SHG. It would 
strengthen corporate governance, improve risk management including internal 
processes and procedures and support a strong ESG agenda within the division. 
It would also promote sharing of knowledge, technology and intellectual capitals 
brought in by institutional investors.
Factors contributing to growth in the domestic and regional healthcare 
industry
Ageing society, ageing nation
Increasing elderly population drives increased demand for high 
quality healthcare. 
Rising affluence and changing lifestyle preferences
Growing disposal incomes among certain societal segments, sees 
shift to increased emphasis of quality living and wellbeing, with 
healthcare being a key aspect of quality living. 
Shift to private sector healthcare over government provided services
Increasing number of Malaysians opting for private healthcare 
providers.
Strong growth in medical tourism sector
Post pandemic, Malaysia sees a return of healthcare travellers 
to the country due to its affordable costs, excellent medical and 
facilitating infrastructure and high-calibre doctors and other 
medical professionals.

HARNESSING OF BUSINESS 
AND OPERATIONAL SYNERGY
JOINT VENTURES AND 
STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS
OVERSEAS EXPANSION
Business divisions within Sunway 
continue to leverage on the strengths 
of each other, notably in the following 
areas: market access and knowledge, 
particularly in terms of specific 
information and expertise to geographic 
markets including legal information and 
operational and regulatory contexts, 
supplier network and business contacts 
as well as sharing of internal resources 
including assets, machineries and 
equipment as well as personnel. 
Customer bases can also be leveraged 
to identify opportunities for upselling to 
customers or providing more customised 
or enhanced value propositions. The 
latter has been implemented effectively 
by the Hospitality, Leisure and Healthcare 
divisions. 
Collaboration in cross 
and upselling tactics by 
offering hotel guests 
leisure packages.

tourism segment where 
patients and their 
families can stay at 
Sunway’s hotels 
during the medical 
treatment period.
Potentials to develop packages that 
enable medical patients to recuperate 
at leisure facilities.
SUNWAY HEALTHCARE: COLLABORATING WITH INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING
Technology acquisition, market access, reduced investment costs and more strategic benefits can be derived by leveraging 
external parties. These can be achieved through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures or other forms of collaboration. 
One such example is the development of the eHousing Development Account (“eHDA”), which is the result of the strategic 
partnership between Sunway Belfield and HSBC. eHDA enables the digital submission of documents. This shortens submission 
and approval times and enables increased convenience.
Sunway Medical Centre Sdn Bhd (SMC) 
and Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman 
(UTAR) signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) to sponsor students 
pursuing a Bachelor of Nursing degree. 
The sponsorship will enable skills 
development of local talents, support 
career opportunities while addressing the 
acute and chronic shortage of professional 
nurses in Malaysia.

FURTHER DIVERSIFICATION INTO HIGH TECH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS
The convergence between sustainable infrastructure development, climate change and lower energy consumption, continues 
to expedite a significant shift towards carbon neutral or greener construction projects. Beyond conventional brick and mortar 
development, the construction industry is transitioning towards more sustainable development, not just in terms of methodologies 
but in the design and development of buildings and infrastructure itself. 
SunCon continues to leverage its growing expertise in this niche but fast expanding sector to grow its order book in delivering 
sustainable buildings for a more sustainable landscape. 
Hence, SunCon’s increased participation in providing EPCC scope of works for developing green buildings and greener infrastructure 
such as district cooling systems, thermal energy storage, green data centres and more. These projects have a lower environmental 
and carbon footprint whilst generating revenues for the business division. Construction of the District Cooling System in Sunway 
Square, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, commenced in July 2022 and is on track for completion by the end of 2024.
Sunway maintains an expansionary stance with regard to its business model. The Group looks to further grow its geographical 
footprint into new markets, bringing its value creation approach towards more stakeholders while contributing to the realisation of 
a brighter and better future. 
Expansion plans are driven by the specific business and operational context of the respective business divisions under the Group. 
Some would leverage on existing presence overseas such as Property Development and Hospitality divisions, while others would be 
executing a maiden expansion outside of Malaysia. 
Specific expansion plans of individual business divisions are provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis section as well 
as the Strategic Snapshots of the respective business division.

The presentation of our Value Creation Model as the culmination of our integrated reporting disclosures serves to present readers with a concise depiction 
of how Sunway’s business model creates value across the six capitals. Indeed, there are trade-offs attributed to the inter-related linkages between 
different capitals. Hence, at times, the enhancement or creation of value in a particular capital can potentially lead to erosion in another capital. 
Sunway is cognisant of these intricate relationships and the goal is to develop deeper understanding and insights in terms of the linkages between 
capitals. The ultimate goal is to achieve value creation, defined in outputs and outcomes across all six capitals. This would be in line with realising the 
Group’s Vision and Mission in its fullest form.

INTELLECTUAL
The Group continues to journey forward and the Value Creation Model 
provides a snapshot of resource dependencies, positive environmental 
and social impacts generated, improvement areas and the aforementioned 
aspect of trade-offs and how can these be improved. 
One focus is inclusion of short, medium and long-term considerations 
where trade-offs between capitals in the short-term will enable improved 
performance in both capitals over the medium and long-term horizons.
OUTCOMES
TRADE-OFFS
There are opportunity costs where trade-offs are required. We allocated financial 
capital to other non-financial capitals to produce balanced outcomes in non-
financial capitals that create multiplier effects in both extrinsic and intrinsic 
value to our stakeholders. In 2023, we continued to invest in an environment 
where our employees can thrive without neglecting their welfare, to improve 
workforce retention and productivity. We also financed our employees’ learning 
and development needs to further develop the Company’s intellectual capital 
in order to deliver excellence in our products and services. As a result of our 
investment in clean technology such as solar panels and a water treatment 
plant, we are also one step closer to responsible resource management and 
waste reduction.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
TAN SRI SIR DR. JEFFREY 
CHEAH FOOK LING KBE AO
Executive Chairman
DEAR VALUED STAKEHOLDERS,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I 
am pleased to present Sunway Berhad’s 
Integrated Annual Report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2023 (“FY 2023”). 
As I pen this statement, Sunway will celebrate 
its golden jubilee in 2024. Over the past 
50 years, the accomplishment of Sunway 
is a demonstration that profitability and 
sustainability can go hand in hand, affirming 
our belief that we can all “do well by doing 
good”.
50 Years of Commitment 
It all started with a piece of abandoned and disused mining land in the Klang Valley in the 1970s. Sunway acquired the 800-acre piece 
of land with a vision to develop the site into an integrated green, smart, and sustainable township. We rehabilitated the barren land and 
restored the ecosystem, both physical and social. Today, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur is a vibrant township of more than 200,000 people 
living, working, playing and studying in a safe, healthy and connected environment. 
In celebrating our 50 th  anniversary, Sunway joins a rare category of global companies that have succeeded in marking their golden jubilee. It 
is a clear indication of our resilience in the face of an ever-changing business environment, and our ability to seize opportunities, overcome 
challenges, and outpace peers in the business sectors in which we operate. And, we have done so while upholding our commitment to the 
three-P bottom line of People, Planet and Prosperity. 
Sunway has grown from strength to strength, anchored by our core values of Integrity, Humility, and Excellence. Our dedication to the 
people and communities we serve is guided by our five foundational pillars: People, Sustainability, Business, Community, and Leadership.
This is underpinned by our firm belief that no corporations can stand apart from the communities it serves. As we mark our half a century 
of service, innovation, and growth, we are grateful for the opportunities afforded to us to learn, share, and impact our business and brand 
in building a more progressive, inclusive and sustainable future for all under the Malaysian sun.

Transforming for the Future 
As we embark on the next chapter of our journey, we do so in a time 
of extreme uncertainty. The rapid advance of technology, climate 
change and rising inequality are shaping what some have described 
as the Age of Disruption. 
Let me begin with technology. Ever more powerful computers, 
sophisticated software and massive data are changing every aspect 
of our lives and livelihoods. Humanity is struggling to cope with 
the volume, velocity and variety of information flows. And now, 
we have to deal with the potential and threats posed by artificial 
intelligence. In this context, I firmly believe that what brought us 
here will not be enough to take us to where we want to be in the 
decades ahead. 
Towards this end, Sunway has established a Transformation Office 
within the Group Strategy Department, to map the strategic 
direction and growth trajectory of the Group to help us overcome 
the challenges we face moving forward. The Transformation Office 
is headed by Mr. Evan Cheah, who also serves as the Group Chief 
Executive Officer – Digital and Strategic Investments as well as 
Alternate Director to the Chairman in Sunway Berhad’s Board. The 
young leadership and team members of the Transformation Office 
is an acknowledgement that Sunway’s future lies in the hands of 
digital natives rather than digital immigrants. 
At Sunway, we invest in our people. We are committed to fostering, 
nurturing and developing their potential to flourish in a culture that 
promotes meritocracy, diversity, and inclusivity. Let me emphasise 
that this element of diversity is not just about race, religion, gender, 
or nationality, but even more important, is inspiring a diversity of 
perspectives. 
Amplifying Our Sustainability Impact 
The very founding of Sunway Group is based on the concept 
of sustainable development. We have fully embraced the 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) adopted unanimously by 
the United Nations in 2015. Sunway has integrated the 17 SDGs in 
all our business practices and decision-making processes. Sunway 
aligns the SDGs with our Environmental, Social and Governance 
(“ESG”) targets as part of our corporate strategy toward driving 
the Group’s long-term success and deepening our commitment to 
nation-building. Sunway has set a goal to achieve net zero carbon 
emissions by 2050.
To demonstrate that we walk the talk, Sunway is the first 
organisation in Malaysia and among the first in Asia to implement 
an internal carbon pricing framework. Starting 2023, business 
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENTCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
divisions that fail to meet the decarbonisation targets are penalised 
by having an amount deducted from their bonus pool. This year, we 
are intensifying our decarbonisation commitment by introducing 
incentives for renewable energy generation and waste diversion from 
landfills. Business divisions that achieve their carbon avoidance 
targets will be rewarded with a pre-determined amount added to 
their bonus pool. 
Our unwavering commitment to higher level of disclosures and 
transparency has earned us commendable ESG ratings. Sunway 
maintained its ranking in the top 10% of the Industry Classification 
Benchmark (Real Estate) Supersector by FTSE Russell and the 
top 2% globally with “Negligible” ESG Risk by Sustainalytics, 
reflecting Sunway’s low-risk exposure. 
Given the threat posed by climate change to the survival of 
humanity, Sunway is committed to achieving green certification for 
the development of all new buildings and townships from 2025 
onwards. Recognising the significance of Scope 3 emissions, 
particularly embodied carbon, Sunway established an embodied 
carbon emissions roadmap for its Building Materials and Quarry 
divisions, quantifying the carbon footprint of all products in 2023. 
Sunway aims to progress towards obtaining an Environmental 
Product Declaration (“EPD”) for these products by 2025, 
underscoring our commitment to transparency and environmental 
responsibility. 
Building a Shared Future Together
Even as Sunway transforms to meet the challenges of the years 
ahead, our core values of Integrity, Humility and Excellence and 
our commitment to sustainability will remain constant. These core 
values and commitment reflect my own belief that every individual 
must have a higher purpose in life. This aspirational nature of the 
Group also serves to attract top talents from the current generation 
who overwhelmingly seek to join a corporation that goes beyond a 
focus on the bottom line and commits to a sense of purpose. 
As many of you are aware, my personal motto is “I aspire to inspire 
before I expire”. 
I hope that what we are achieving here in Sunway will inspire other 
corporations and organisations in the region to adopt and advance 
the sustainability agenda. To reiterate, we can all “do well by doing 
good”. 
Appreciation and Acknowledgements
Over the past 50 years, I feel very blessed to have the benefit of 
working with a dedicated and competent team, as well as passionate 
and like-minded partners throughout this journey. Our people are 
the core of our success. To my Sunway family, your dedication, hard 
work, and passion have propelled the Group to where it is today.

On behalf of the Board, we extend our sincere appreciation to Tan 
Sri Jamaludin bin Ibrahim, for his invaluable contribution during 
his tenure as Independent Non-Executive Director, and wish him 
all the best in his future endeavours. 
As we start our next chapter of the journey, diversity in leadership is 
paramount to leading the Group to the next level, especially in the 
age of digital disruption. To this end, the Board welcomes Mr. Evan 
Cheah, as Alternate Director to the Chairman. 
To all our stakeholders, I thank you for your confidence and trust. 
Over the past 50 years, many have been pivotal to transforming our 
brand, faithfully and passionately journeying with us as we build a 
better future together.

CHEW CHEE KIN
President
PRESIDENT’S STATEMENT
Thriving Financial Performance in a Dynamic Landscape
The global economy slowed down against the backdrop of synchronised monetary 
tightening by central banks in most parts of the world for the financial year ended 31 
December 2023 (“FY 2023”). The start of FY 2023 was marked by concerns over 
a potential slowdown in global economic growth, fear of recession, and escalating 
geopolitical tensions. Nevertheless, the reopening of China’s economy delivered an 
uplift to global marketplace dynamics. As the year progressed into its second half, the 
global economic outlook improved due to easing inflation rates and more favourable 
labour market conditions.
Navigating through these challenges, the Malaysian economy expanded by 3.7% in 
2023. The Bank Negara Malaysia’s (“BNM”) conscientious monetary policy tightening 
effectively mitigated inflationary pressures, with headline inflation peaked at 4.7% in 
August 2022 and subsequently eased to 1.5% by December 2023. In response to 
the waning inflation, BNM paused its monetary policy tightening at 3.00% since May 
2023, a move that continues to bolster Malaysia’s economic growth.
The Group achieved a record-high revenue since Sunway’s merger and listing 
in 2011. Specifically, the Group’s revenue climbed by 17% to RM6.1 billion in  
FY 2023, breaching the RM6 billion threshold for the first time, driven by increased 
revenue from all core business segments. Similarly, profit before tax (“PBT”) rose 
by 9%, from RM909.2 million in the previous financial year to RM993.3 million in  
FY 2023. 
Supercharging Growth in the Southern Region 
The operating landscape for the Property Development division was mixed in FY 2023, 
influenced by the monetary tightening policy, and various measures within the property 
sectors in Malaysia, Singapore, and China. In Malaysia, the residential property market 
demonstrated an overall improvement in 2023, with the volume of residential property 
overhang dropping to its lowest since 2019 despite a higher number of new residential 
property launches.
The Property Development division recorded higher launches and property sales in  
FY 2023. New property launches in FY 2023 more than tripled, from RM1.0 billion 
in FY 2022 to RM4.4 billion. Compared to FY 2022, property sales grew by 20% to 
RM2.4 billion in FY 2023, bolstered by increased sales and progress billings from new 
and existing local property projects.
The Southern region of Peninsular Malaysia became a property market hotspot following 
the announcement of the government-led catalytic special economic zone between 
Johor and Singapore (“JS-SEZ”). The JS-SEZ is formulated to enhance bilateral 
economic ties and improve connectivity between the two countries while facilitating 
smoother movement of people and goods across the border. With the anticipated 
opening of the Rapid Transit System Link (“RTS”) in 2026, which is capable of 
handling 10,000 passengers per hour, it will significantly reduce congestion on the 
Johor-Singapore causeway and the Second Link.

DEAR VALUED STAKEHOLDERS,
As we reflect on the year 2023, it is clear that 
Sunway Berhad has gone through a challenging 
macroeconomic landscape that demonstrated 
resilience despite the rising geopolitical tensions, 
high inflation rate and synchronised monetary 
tightening by central banks in most parts of 
the world. Against this challenging backdrop, 
Sunway achieved several significant milestones. 
Impressively, the Group’s revenue surpassed 
the RM6.0 billion mark, a record-high since 
Sunway Berhad’s merger and listing in 2011. 
This achievement was anchored by the steadfast 
performance of our core business segments, which 
has enabled Sunway to grow from strength to 
strength over the past five decades. Building on 
this solid foundation, Sunway is poised to embark 
on a transformation journey to map the next phase 
of our growth and further fortify our position as one 
of the leading conglomerates in ASEAN.

▶ Equalbase Sunway 103° Groundbreaking Ceremony at Sunway City Iskandar Puteri
▶ Sunway Medical Centre, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur
These developments augur well for the Group’s township in the Iskandar region, Sunway City Iskandar Puteri (“SCIP”). Spanning 
close to 1,800 acres, SCIP is an integrated city in perfect harmony with nature, boasting a gross development value (“GDV”) of 
RM30 billion and situated only 5 minutes from Singapore via the Second Link highway. Leveraging on the prospects of JS-SEZ, 
the division launched Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Sunway Aviana’s linked houses in the final quarter of FY 2023, which received 
overwhelming take-up rates.
Furthermore, the Group entered into a joint venture with Equalbase, a Singapore-headquartered real estate group focusing on 
sustainable and industrial logistics facilities, to develop Equalbase Sunway 103°. The project is named after Johor’s geographic 
coordinates at a longitude of 103 east of the prime meridian and is the first fully carbon-neutral logistics facility within SCIP’s Free 
Commercial Zone. With a GDV of RM8 billion, Equalbase Sunway 103° marks Sunway’s maiden foray into sustainable logistics 
development in the Southern region of Malaysia. Sunway is excited by this opportunity to establish SCIP as the Group’s crown jewel 
of Malaysia’s southern development corridor. Equalbase Sunway 103°, which spans over 55 hectares, is poised to enhance the 
vibrancy of SCIP’s integrated township ecosystem and can potentially generate at least 13,000 job opportunities.
A Blue-Chip Multidisciplinary Healthcare Group
The Group’s healthcare division, Sunway Healthcare Group (“SHG”), continued to solidify its position as a leading integrated 
private healthcare group in Malaysia. Its three operating hospitals performed well in FY 2023, underpinned primarily by the strong 
demand for quality healthcare services. Hence, SHG has ramped up its hospital expansion efforts for these hospitals to better serve 
the market, and to extend its reach to international patients through medical tourism. SHG has also worked to deepen the Group’s 
healthcare offerings, launching Malaysia’s first dedicated paediatric Accident and Emergency (“A&E”) Department at the new tower 
of Sunway Medical Centre, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur (“SMC SCKL”) and Sunway Sanctuary, an integrated senior living community 
in SCKL in FY 2023. 
In the Northern region, Sunway Medical Centre Penang (“SMC Penang”) demonstrated remarkable performance in its maiden year 
of operations. The hospital opened its doors in November 2022. In the third month of operations, SMC Penang achieved breakeven 
of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”). Within one year of operations, SMC Penang achieved 
PBT breakeven in November 2023. This record is a testament to the effectiveness of SHG’s strategy in operating new hospitals and 
its fast-tracked route to achieving profitability. 
In tandem with these achievements, SHG has marked several financial milestones 
in FY 2023, with revenue soaring to RM1.5 billion after surpassing the RM1 billion 
mark in the previous year. This represents the third consecutive year of an over 30% 
increase in annual revenue for SHG. Similarly, its EBITDA has consistently grew by 
more than 30% annually in the past three years.
 
In another monumental achievement, SMC SCKL has been recognised as among the 
top 250 hospitals globally in the highly esteemed Newsweek & Statista’s World’s Best 
Hospitals 2024. 
Pushing New Frontiers in Construction 
The Group continued to pursue opportunities in new areas to achieve long-term 
sustainable growth to enhance stakeholders’ value. Our commitment to continual 
innovation as a value creation driver is exemplified by the Construction division, which 
has reinforced its standing as a premier vertically integrated construction company 
in Malaysia by venturing into the advanced technology facilities sector and new 
geographical markets. 
Throughout FY 2023, the Construction division made good progress in expanding 
its project portfolio in the data centres, global distribution centre warehouses, and 
renewable energy segments, securing RM677 million worth of such new contracts. 
Consequently, the Construction division has surpassed its FY 2023 order book 
replenishment target of RM2.0 billion, amassing RM2.5 billion worth of new 
orders consisting of advanced technology facilities and renewable energy projects, 
infrastructure projects like the RTS Link, and the Group’s internal projects.
On the international front, the Construction division has substantially completed the 
Meesurutti-Chidambaram Highway project in India. Additionally, the division intends 
to deepen its regional footprint in countries like India, Singapore and Vietnam while 
continuing to explore expansion into new territories.

Economic Resilience Fortifies Operating Landscape 
Tourist arrivals to Malaysia continued to record improvement, doubling to 20.1 million in 2023, yet remaining below the levels seen 
in the pre-pandemic era of 2019. The Group’s Leisure, Hospitality, REIT, Retail, and Healthcare divisions were able to capitalise 
on the resurgence in tourist arrivals and experienced higher rates of visitation to the Group’s theme parks and retail malls, better 
occupancy rates for the hotels, and increased contributions from medical tourism. 
Delivering Value to Shareholders
In line with our commitment to deliver value to our esteemed shareholders, the Board declared a total dividend of 5.50 sen per 
ordinary share for FY 2023, which is on par with the dividend declared in FY 2022. The dividend payout exceeded the Group’s 
dividend payout guidance of 20% of core PATMI. Additionally, the Group declared a preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum 
based on the issue price of RM1.00 irredeemable convertible preference shares (“ICPS”) for the period from 1 January 2023 to  
31 December 2023.
As a result, Sunway has achieved a total shareholder return of 31% for the financial year and an impressive 231% since 2011, post 
merger and listing of Sunway Berhad.
Improving Prospects with Economic Resilience 
This is a momentous year for Sunway as the Group celebrates 
its 50th anniversary in 2024. Since 1974, Sunway has grown 
from strength to strength, transforming Sunway City Kuala 
Lumpur from a “wasteland” to a “wonderland” and now, 
one of the leading conglomerates in ASEAN. As we start a 
new chapter of our journey into the next decades, Sunway 
continues to pursue regionalisation, investments and merger 
and acquisition opportunities to fortify our position as a 
leading conglomerate in ASEAN.
The International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) anticipates the 
global economy to expand at a pace of 3.2% in 2024, driven 
by resilience in developed economies and fiscal support 
in China. Notably, inflation has eased from its peak across 
most regions, reflecting the effectiveness of the past year’s 
monetary tightening policies and auguring well for the year 
ahead. 
The Malaysian economy is expected to maintain a 
healthy economic growth in 2024, supported by a stable 
macroeconomic outlook, low unemployment rate, resilient 
domestic demand, mild inflation, and higher investments. 
Both domestic and foreign investments, as well as private 
and public investments, are expected to benefit from the tech 
upcycle and catalytic initiatives under the New Industrial 
Master Plan 2030 and the National Energy Transition 
Roadmap. 
Against this backdrop, the Property Development division is 
set to focus on accelerating development in SCIP, our township 
in the Iskandar region, expanding its industrial capacity, 
exploring regional opportunities, and acquire strategic land 
banks in the Klang Valley and Southern region. This year, the 
division aims to launch RM2.1 billion worth of properties, 
predominantly in Malaysia, and has raised its property sales 
target to RM2.6 billion. 
Globally, the demand for superior healthcare continues to rise, 
with healthcare spending in Malaysia expected to increase 
by 7.7% per annum over the next five years. Supported by 
this positive outlook, the healthcare division will continue its 
business expansion efforts for its three operating hospitals 
to meet this demand, and aims to commence operations for 
Sunway Medical Centre Damansara in the final quarter of 
2024 and Sunway Medical Centre Ipoh in the first quarter of 
2025. Plans are also underway to develop three more hospitals 
in SCIP in Johor, Paya Terubong in Penang, and Kota Bharu in 
Kelantan to expand our reach to these underserved locations.
Given the strong demand for data centres in Malaysia, a slew 
of new and emerging investments of data centres with over 
800MW capacity is projected to come on stream in phases 
over the next five years. Sunway’s Construction division, 
having positioned itself in the high-value construction sector, 
is poised to capitalise on this opportunity and is forging 
ahead to grow its advanced technology facilities portfolio 
such as data centres, logistics warehouse facilities and 
semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The Construction 
division has raised its order book replenishment target from 
RM2.0 billion in the previous year to between RM2.5 and 
RM3.0 billion, as a total of RM90 billion in development 
expenditure was announced under the Budget 2024, which 
includes the Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”) 3 and Penang Light 
Rail Transit (“LRT”) projects. 
While Malaysia’s tourism recovery has not kept pace with its 
neighbours, tourist arrivals are expected to improve further in 
2024, boosted by a weak domestic currency, the introduction 
of 30-day visa-free entry for Chinese and Indian nationals, and 
improving flight connectivity and frequency. Consequently, 
the Group’s Leisure, Hospitality, Property Investment, REIT, 
Retail, and Healthcare divisions are poised to benefit from 
the anticipated increase in tourist arrivals and spending 
within Malaysia. 
In Appreciation
Sunway’s achievements over the past decades would not have 
been possible if not for the unwavering support of our external 
and internal stakeholders. On behalf of the Management team, 
I would like to acknowledge all our stakeholders – our Board 
of Directors, business partners, shareholders, regulators, 
governing bodies, and customers – for your steadfast support 
through both the highs and lows over the years. Your trust in 
Sunway is invaluable. 
My sincere appreciation also goes out to my fellow Sunwayians 
for your passion, commitment and dedication to pursuing our 
shared aspirations. Together, we will thrive in the decades 
ahead, building a shared future together.

GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group recorded higher revenue of RM6,136.2 million and profit before tax of RM993.3 million in FY 2023 compared to revenue of 
RM5,194.9 million and profit before tax of RM909.2 million in FY 2022. Revenue rose 18.1% in the financial year under review due to 
higher contribution from most business segments except for the others segment. Profit before tax increased by 9.3% in the current period 
underpinned by higher profit contribution from most business segments except for the healthcare and others segments.
In accordance to MFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the development profit from two of the Group’s Singapore property 
development projects will only be recognised upon completion and handover of the projects. In FY 2023, one of the property development 
project was completed and handed over, which resulted in the recognition of development profit of RM46.3 million. The other property 
development project is expected to be completed and handed over in the first half of 2024. As at 31 December 2023, the accumulated 
progressive profit for the project amounted to RM108.9 million. 
During the year, Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCity”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, had entered into a Share Transactions 
Agreement with Iskandar Asset Sdn. Bhd. (“IASB”) and Sunway Iskandar Development Sdn. Bhd. (“SIDSB”), a joint venture of the 
Group, to acquire the remaining 40% stake in SIDSB and redemption of non-convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 
held by IASB for a total consideration of RM85.0 million (as disclosed in Note 19(f) to the financial statements). The transaction was 
completed on 21 August 2023 and consequently, SIDSB and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group.
The financial effects arising from the remeasurement of the previously held equity interests in SIDSB in accordance with MFRS 3 
Business Combinations amounted to a net loss of RM0.5 million. The consolidated net assets from SIDSB mainly comprise of inventories 
(land held for property development) amounting to RM728.5 million.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Property Development
In FY 2023, the Property Development division reported revenue 
of RM1,414.9 million and profit before tax of RM211.6 million, 
compared to revenue of RM1,165.3 million and profit before tax 
of RM155.3 million in FY 2022, marking an increase in revenue of 
21.4% and profit before tax of 36.3%. 
Revenue in the current period rose on higher sales and progress 
billings from new and on-going local development projects and the 
completion and handover of a local project. 
Profit before tax in the current period was boosted by the recognition 
of development profit of RM46.3 million upon the completion and 
handover of one of the Group’s Singapore property development 
projects during the year. 
Property Investment
The Property Investment division registered revenue of RM898.6 
million and profit before tax of RM293.7 million for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM690.0 
million and profit before tax of RM235.8 million in the previous 
financial year, representing an increase in revenue of 30.2% and 
profit before tax of 24.5%. The improved financial performance 
in the current period was attributed to strong performance of the 
leisure and hospitality businesses with increased visitorships to 
the theme parks and higher occupancy rates at the Group’s hotels, 
coupled with higher revenue from operations of property investment 
assets. 
Meanwhile, profit before tax for the current period included net fair 
value gains from revaluation of investment properties and assets of 
RM67.9 million compared with overall fair value loss of RM22.9 
million and net gains on disposal of property investment assets of 
RM28.1 million reported in the previous financial year.
Construction
The Construction division generated revenue of RM1,688.9 million 
and profit before tax of RM197.9 million for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM1,281.6 million 
and profit before tax of RM186.6 million in the previous financial 
year, marking an increase in revenue of 31.8% and profit before tax 
of 6.1%. Higher progress billings from local construction projects 
contributed to the better performance in the current period. 
Healthcare
The Healthcare division reported a share of net profit of RM152.7 
million in the current financial year, which is 13.6% lower compared 
to RM176.8 million in the previous financial year. The higher share 
of net profit in FY 2022 included a RM48.3 million share of a one-
off net remeasurement gain of leases as per MFRS 16, in relation 
to the early termination of rental arrangement of Tower A and B 
occupied by Sunway Medical Centre (“SMC”) Sunway City. 
Excluding the one-off net gain, EBITDA of the division grew by 
33.0% in FY 2023, and the share of net profit of RM152.7 million 
in the current financial year was higher compared to the adjusted 
share of net profit of RM140.1 million in the previous year. 
The improved underlying financial performance in the current 
financial year reflected stronger operational results contributed by 
SMC Sunway City and SMC Velocity which mitigated the higher 
operating costs, the share of start-up operational losses from SMC 
Penang and Sunway Sanctuary of RM15.9 million, as well as the 
higher share of additional tax payable of RM18.2 million following 
the normalisation of SMC Sunway City’s tax paying status as its 
Investment Tax Allowance (ITA) was fully utilised in the previous 
financial year. 
Trading and Manufacturing 
The Trading and Manufacturing division registered higher revenue 
of RM954.6 million and profit before tax of RM45.1 million for the 
current financial year ended 31 December 2023, higher by 5.8% 
and 8.6% respectively, compared to revenue of RM902.1 million 
and profit before tax of RM41.6 million in the previous financial 
year. The improved financial performance in the FY 2023 was 
mainly due to higher contribution from the domestic market. 
Quarry
The Quarry division reported a 9.9% higher revenue of RM446.3 
million and a 101% higher profit before tax of RM27.5 million for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023 compared to revenue 
of RM406.2 million and profit before tax of RM13.7 million in the 
previous financial year. The improved performance in the current 
year was attributed to increased demand from local council and 
highway projects which resulted in higher sales volumes and average 
selling prices for both aggregates and premix. 
Building Materials
The Building Materials division recorded revenue of RM232.5 million 
and profit before tax of RM51.6 million for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023 compared to revenue of RM219.8 million and 
profit before tax of RM20.0 million in the previous financial year, 
representing an increase in revenue of 5.8% and profit before tax of 
158.0%. Higher revenue was mainly due to higher sales volume and 
selling prices and improved profitability which included the reversal 
of provision for impairment of assets of RM19.8 million from spun 
pile operation under the segment.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION STATEMENT OF CASH FLOW
DIVIDENDS DECLARED
The Group’s total gross borrowings increased to RM9.7 billion in 
FY 2023 from RM9.1 billion in FY 2022, while cash and bank 
balances grew to RM2.3 billion in FY 2023 from RM2.0 billion in 
the previous financial year. As a result, the Group’s net borrowings, 
calculated as total gross borrowings minus cash and bank balances, 
was higher at RM7.4 billion in FY 2023 compared to RM7.1 billion 
in the previous financial year. The additional gross borrowings 
during the year were mainly utilised for capital expenditures related 
to acquisition of Property, Plant and Equipment and development 
of investment properties. The higher borrowings was also attributed 
to the redemption of the RM600 million Perpetual Sukuk during 
the year. 
Total assets increased to RM28.6 billion in FY 2023 from RM26.1 
billion in FY 2022, underpinned by increase in inventories by 
RM788.2 million, increase in total receivables by RM598.4 
million, higher investment in joint ventures by RM455.2 million, 
as well as increase in cash and bank balances by RM338.9 million. 
A significant contributor to the asset growth, specifically on the 
inventories, was the consolidation of net assets from a joint venture 
that was reclassified as a subsidiary of the Group during the year, 
as disclosed in Note 19(f) to the financial statements. Additionally, 
the improvement in business operations also supported the increase 
in total assets.
Share capital increased substantially to RM7.1 billion in  
FY 2023 from RM6.4 billion in FY 2022, due to the issuance of 
new ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of warrants amounted 
to RM676.4 million and completion of Dividend Reinvestment 
Scheme (“DRS”) for the second interim single-tier dividend for FY 
2022 which amounted to RM90.5 million during the year. This has 
partly lowered the net gearing ratio to 0.49x from 0.52x in FY 2022.

* Net gearing ratio calculations exclude cross currency swap.
Operating Activities
Net cash generated from operating activities rose to RM459.0 
million in FY 2023 compared to RM336.8 million in FY 2022, 
mainly driven by the Group’s improved profitability in FY 2023, 
particularly from property development, property investment, 
construction, trading and manufacturing and quarry segments. 
Investing Activities
In FY 2023, the Group’s funds utilised for investing activities of 
RM558.4 million was lower compared to RM583.2 million in  
FY 2022. The lower amount utilised in the current financial year was 
mainly due to lower quasi-equity loans advanced to joint ventures 
by RM198.3 million and higher proceeds received from disposal of 
other investments compared to FY 2022.
Financing Activities
The Group generated net cash inflow of RM415.9 million from 
financing activities in FY 2023, compared to an outflow of RM585.9 
million in FY 2022. This was mainly attributed to higher net 
borrowings drawdown of RM703.4 million coupled with proceeds 
from the exercise of warrants of RM676.4 million in current 
financial year. The cash inflow was partly offset by redemption of 
perpetual sukuk amounted to RM596.6 million, interest paid and 
dividends paid in FY 2023. 
As a result, cash and cash equivalents of the Group increased to 
RM2.2 billion as at 31 December 2023 from RM1.9 billion as at 
31 December 2022.
Ordinary shares
In line with the Group’s commitment to deliver value to our esteemed 
shareholders, the Board had declared a total dividend of 5.50 sen 
per ordinary share for FY 2023, which is on par with dividend 
declared of 5.50 sen per ordinary share for FY 2022. 
The full year FY 2023 dividends consist of the followings: 
i. first interim single-tier dividend of 2.00 sen per ordinary share, 
which was paid on 12 October 2023 amounting to RM99.1 
million, and 
ii.  second interim single-tier dividend of 3.50 sen per ordinary 
share (“Second Interim Dividend”), which was declared on 
21 February 2024. The Board had resolved that the dividend 
reinvestment scheme (“DRS”), which was approved by the 
shareholders of Sunway (“Shareholders”) at the Extraordinary 
General Meeting of Sunway held on 26 June 2014, will apply 
to the entire Second Interim Dividend. The Shareholders will 
be provided the option to elect to reinvest the entire Second 
Interim Dividend into new Sunway Shares (“New Shares”).
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s business activities and operational processes are 
governed by its Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) that is 
benchmarked against ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management - 
Guidelines. It enables the Group to effectively identify, evaluate, 
mitigate and monitor financial, operational, and strategic risks to 
safeguard the interests of all Sunway stakeholders.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Sunway adopts a prudent financial capital management strategy 
that is managed through its centralised treasury operations. Treasury 
will monitor and review the Group’s exposure to ensure an optimal 
debt-to-equity mix, providing the Group with a flexible capital 
structure and ensuring a well-balanced borrowing profile to meet 
funding requirements. Through proactive measures, interest rate 
and foreign currency risks associated with the Group’s borrowings 
are promptly addressed. This flexibility provides the Group with 
sufficient liquidity as and when required.
The Group’s financial strength is backed by Malaysian Rating 
Corporation Berhad (“MARC”)’s credit rating of Sunway’s private 
debt securities programmes which was upheld at MARC-1/AA- 
during the latest review in November 2023.
ii.  (continued)
 On 5 March 2024, the issue price of the New Shares to be issued 
pursuant to the DRS had been fixed at RM2.51 per new ordinary 
share. The books closure date for the Second Interim Dividend 
and the DRS has been fixed on 19 March 2024. Allotment and 
issuance of new ordinary shares as well as payment of cash 
dividend to the ordinary shareholders has been fixed on 18 April 
2024. 
This pay-out reflects the Group’s confidence in its strategic direction 
and ability to generate sustainable growth, maintaining a steadfast 
focus on financial prudence and operational efficiency. 
In the near term, the Group is confident on the financial performance 
of FY 2024, building from the growth momentum of FY 2023. The 
Group is mindful of the importance in providing consistent returns 
to its shareholders and optimising shareholder value in the years 
ahead. 
Irredeemable convertible preference shares (“ICPS”)
On 12 October 2023, a preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum 
based on the issue price of RM1.00 per ICPS for the period from 1 
January 2023 up to and including 30 June 2023 which amounted 
to RM25.7 million was paid to the ICPS holders.
Preferential dividend of 5.25% per annum based on the issue price 
of RM1.00 per ICPS for the period from 1 July 2023 up to and 
including 31 December 2023 was declared on 21 February 2024 
to the ICPS holders. The entitled ICPS shareholders will receive 
preferential dividend in cash amounting to approximately RM25.7 
million on 18 April 2024.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FY 2023 presented a mixed operating environment for Sunway’s 
Property Development division, with numerous economic and social 
factors affecting consumer sentiment in the property markets of 
Malaysia, Singapore and China.
In Malaysia, the property sector showed a mostly resilient post-
pandemic performance with the number of new housing launches 
and sales improving year-on-year from 2022. However, global 
economic uncertainties presented various challenges, including 
inflation, higher interest rates and a weakened ringgit. This led to 
a surge in prices of imported goods and materials, and significantly 
impacted housing prices. The Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) rate 
which increased to 3% from the low of 1.75%, also affected buyers’ 
affordability. On a positive note, the government’s announcement 
of more relaxed requirements for the Malaysia My Second Home 
(“MM2H”) programme opened up opportunities for more residential 
property purchases by non-Malaysians.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
In Singapore, macroeconomic challenges, higher interest rates and 
cooling measures by the government led to higher property prices 
and a more cautious market sentiment among both domestic and 
foreign buyers. Meanwhile, the property market in China recorded 
a steep drop in property prices and sales despite continuous 
government support and relaxation of home purchase restrictions, 
affecting the country’s broader economic recovery.
In terms of market trends, Malaysia’s continued urbanisation meant 
marked shifts in population growth, age distribution and lifestyle 
trends, thereby increasing demand for quality homes. On the 
environmental front, growing public awareness of environmental 
issues along with the impacts of climate change and extreme 
weather events boosted further demand for eco-friendly properties. 
▶ Artist’s impression of Sunway Velocity TWO in Sunway Velocity Kuala Lumpur
Given that economic growth is concentrated in high-development 
areas with more infrastructure and job opportunities, the division 
capitalised on Malaysia’s urbanisation trends by seeking to replenish 
its landbank and expand geographically to diversify risks across 
markets. Brand positioning and market leadership was another key 
focus area to sustain the Group’s competitive advantage of being 
a strong brand associated with the values of quality, trust and 
reliability. The division also sought to diversify its revenue streams 
to enhance business resilience across asset cycles.
In light of the highly competitive nature of the property market, the 
division adopted a strategy of differentiation by enhancing product 
innovation through its Sunway Design and Development Architecture 
(“SDDA”) series. This was supported by an innovative approach 
to managing demographic shifts along with changing consumer 
preferences. With customer sentiment being mostly cautious and 
value-seeking in 2023, the division strove to deliver customer-
centric innovation and engagement with its Sunway Property+ 
membership programme. In addition, digital transformation efforts 
remained an important emphasis across the real estate value chain.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Please see page 34 for more information on the Property 
Development division’s Strategic Snapshot.
Internally, the division focused on developing talent capabilities 
and competencies, including human capital, by strengthening the 
principles of the Master Community Developer (“MCD”) culture 
throughout the organisation. Maintaining a safe, equal and dignified 
workforce was also of paramount importance, which was reinforced 
with the continued pursuit of ISO 45001: 2018 certification. 
Additionally, social linkage events were held across the division’s 
nationwide presence to foster better relationships, create a positive 
work culture and encourage cross-functional engagement outside of 
the workplace.
In tandem with the division’s commitment to driving the Group’s 
ESG-driven value proposition, sustainability efforts were ramped 
up. These included transforming its portfolios into low-carbon 
sustainable cities by ensuring that all projects were ISO 14001 
compliant with certification maintained, improving waste diversion 
from construction sites and investing in sustainable office space 
upgrades based on the respective team’s needs. 
It also advocated for a responsible value chain through the 
digitalisation of its supply chain. This involved the introduction of 
new platforms as well as the ongoing use of existing platforms to 
streamline and improve communications across the supply chain.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Successful Launches and Sales
The Property Development division successfully launched RM4.4 
billion worth of properties in FY 2023, with RM3.1 billion worth 
of properties launched in Singapore, followed by RM1.2 billion 
in Malaysia and RM0.1 billion in China. Overall, the division 
achieved RM2.4 billion in total sales for FY 2023, exceeding its 
target of RM2.3 billion.
The division’s 4 residential property launches in Malaysia were 
Sunway Flora Residences in Bukit Jalil, Jernih Residences in 
Kajang, Sunway Dora in Penang and Sunway Aviana in Johor, all 
of which performed well. Most of the projects across Malaysia, 
including those in the Klang Valley and Penang surpassed a 70% 
take-up rate, while Sunway Aviana which was only launched in 
October 2023 managed to surpass a 50% take-up rate in a short 
time, attesting to the strength of the SDDA framework and the 
purchasers’ trust in the Sunway brand.
The division also successfully launched the Sunway Signature 
Series 2023 Campaign featuring these Signature Homes that 
incorporate the four pillars of SDDA, namely Sustainability, 
Innovation, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle & New Experiences 
with total bookings of RM1.0 billion achieved. 
In Singapore, two private condominium developments were 
launched in 2023 namely Terra Hills in February 2023 and The 
Continuum in April 2023. These new projects achieved modest 
take up rates. 
In China, a new block of condominium at Sunway Gardens Phase 
3, Tianjin, was launched in the second half of 2023, offering a 
housing community which emphasised on Lifestyle of Health and 
Sustainability (“LOHAS”) concept.
Construction Completion and Handovers
In FY 2023, the division successfully completed and handed over 
a few property development projects in Malaysia and Singapore.
In the Klang Valley, the division delivered two blocks of Sunway 
Serene Phase 1 and Sunway Velocity Two (Plot A) which consist 
of two 53-storey apartment blocks and a 28-storey office tower. 
In Sunway City Iskandar Puteri, 128-units of Sunway Citrine 
Lakehomes Phase 3 was completed and handed over to its 
homeowners. 
In Singapore, Parc Canberra’s 496-unit executive condominium 
was completed and handed over in the third quarter of FY 2023, 
which contributed to a development profit recognition of RM46.3 
million to the financial performance of the division in FY 2023.
Strategic Landbanking
In the year under review, the Property Development division added 
sizeable landbanks into its portfolio. In May 2023, the division 
proposed to acquire 5.09 acres of prime freehold land in Seri 
Hartamas, Kuala Lumpur for a purchase consideration of up to 
RM220 million for a proposed mixed development project with 
an indicative Gross Development Value (“GDV”) of up to RM1.1 
billion. 
The division also successfully acquired a large 245 acres of 
freehold land in Kuang, Selangor to rebalance its landbank mix 
for a purchase consideration of RM115 million with an estimated 
GDV of at least RM2 billion. The land was intended for the 
development of an industrial technology park which will house 
factories, warehouses and commercial units.
On 11 September 2023, the Housing and Development Board 
of Singapore awarded a 4.06-acre lease term land parcel at 
Tengah Plantation Close to a joint venture collaboration between 
Hoi Hup Realty Pte Ltd and Sunway Developments Pte Ltd, a 
subsidiary of Sunway, for a tender price of SGD$348.5 million 
(approximately RM1.2 billion). The land will be developed into 
executive condominium with a GDV of approximately SGD$730 
million (approximately RM2.5 billion), targeted to be launched 
in early 2025.
With the landbank acquisitions during the year, the total landbank 
for the division stood at 2,467 acres with a GDV of RM52.9 billion 
as at 31 December 2023.
Environmental Initiatives
All the residential properties launched in Malaysia in  
FY 2023 were green renewable energy certified and designed in 
accordance with the SDDA framework with emphasis on efficient 
sustainable land, energy and water use. Furthermore, 5.7% of 
waste was successfully diverted from landfills in 2023 through 
the segregation of waste materials by type, such as steel and 
timber at the construction sites and recycled separately. This is 
above the initial 2023 target set of 4%. 2023 also marked the 
10th  consecutive year of Sunway achieving zero non-conformity in 
SIRIM’s audit report for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 (Environmental 
Management).
Property Awards and Industry Recognition
The division reaffirmed its position as one of the top developers 
in the country through numerous industry awards and accolades 
secured in FY 2023. These include the runner-up ranking at The 
Edge Malaysia’s Top Property Developers Awards 2023, Silver 
award at the Putra Brand Awards 2023 in Property Development 
and Top Sustainable Developer in Malaysia as awarded by Green 
RE. Its property development projects, Sunway Emerald Residence 
and Sunway Velocity received Gold and Bronze respectively in The 
Edge Best Managed & Sustainable Property Awards 2023. At 
the recent FIABCI Malaysia Property Award 2023, Sunway City 
Iskandar Puteri and Sunway GEOLake Residences were awarded 
winners in the Master Plan and Residential High Rise categories 
respectively.
The division was also awarded the No.1 choice in the Talentbank 
Graduates’ Choice Awards 2023 in the Property Developer 
category.
Please see page 13 for more information on the Property 
Development division’s awards and accolades.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Sunway’s Property Development division aims to achieve FY 2024 
target sales of RM2.6 billion with a robust RM2.1 billion worth 
of property development projects in the pipeline for launch that 
are tailored for the current market conditions and the right buyer 
categories. Planned launches in FY 2024 are mainly developments 
located in the Klang Valley, Johor, Ipoh and Penang, as well as in 
China.
Despite economic fluctuations, the residential property market in 
Malaysia is showing positive momentum with rising sales volume, 
successful project completions and the introduction of new property 
developments. With strong government support in the form of 
property-related initiatives and incentives, especially following the 
Budget 2024 announcements, as well as strengthened partnerships 
between developers and financial institutions to facilitate increased 
homeownership, the residential market remains cautiously optimistic 
going into FY 2024.
The division anticipates the potential risks of supply chain disruptions, 
market oversupply and construction cost hikes arising from economic 
uncertainties, credit market conditions and government policy 
changes in relation to property, land use or taxation, to weigh on its 
performance in FY 2024. To mitigate these challenges, the division 
looks forward to diversify its project portfolios and market reach, and 
has identified new growth region for future developments. 
To this end, Sunway’s Property Development division has signed 
two memorandums of understanding (MoU) with the Sarawak 
Foundation and Land Custody and Development Authority (“LCDA”) 
respectively. The first MoU with the Sarawak Foundation is to jointly 
explore the transformation of 119 prime acres of land in Kuching 
into a ‘state-of-the-art’ Digital Medical Village Development. The 
second MoU with LCDA is for the proposed redevelopment of a 497-
acre urban renewal area in Bukit Assek, Sibu. The two projects will 
take inspiration from Sunway’s Build, Own, Operate business model 
and aspire to emulate the award-winning Sunway City Kuala Lumpur 
township to revitalise the city with an integrated modern smart city 
master plan, feasibility studies and design innovations.
Additionally, the division plans to continue growing its footprint in 
Singapore and China. The upcoming completion of the Johor Bahru-
Singapore Rapid Transit System Link (“RTS Link”), slated for the 
end of 2026, is anticipated to boost homebuyers’ interest in both 
Malaysia and Singapore with the promise of smoother connectivity 
and faster travel times. Other factors including the announcement 
of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone is poised to bring 
about new opportunities in Johor where Sunway has built its largest 
township yet, Sunway City Iskandar Puteri. 
In November 2023, Sunway partnered with Equalbase to build a 
logistics facility in a first fully carbon-neutral free commercial zone 
with a GDV of RM8 billion in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri. The 
development is expected to cater to a diverse range of industries in 
the region, including FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods), retail, 
e-commerce, automotive, pharmaceutical and technology. The 
facility’s strategic location will contribute further to the growth of 
the township. 
While in Singapore, Sunway’s joint venture company with Hoi Hup 
Realty Pte Ltd successfully secured another 4.95 acres of lease 
hold term land at Tengah Plantation Close at a tender price of 
SGD423.38 million. This marks the second land acquisition in 
FUTURE ORIENTATION
Aside from this, the division will engage in proactive advocacy and 
diversification of its projects to reduce dependence on local policy 
environments. It will also continue to establish strategic partnerships 
with reliable suppliers and develop contingencies for potential supply 
chain disruptions. For this reason, comprehensive market research 
will remain a vital focus, ensuring that the division’s strategic 
considerations are backed by data-driven insights to understand 
current property trends and demand patterns for effective decision 
making and efficient project planning.
Moving into 2024 and beyond, the division will continue to leverage 
the synergistic strength of the Sunway ecosystem to augment its 
competitive advantage and support the sales of its developments 
with innovative marketing campaigns to address homeownership 
challenges and provide additional benefits to enhance brand loyalty. 
Digital transformation will continue to be a major component of 
driving such innovation through Sunway Property+, Sunway Booking 
System, Sunway e-Connect and Sunway e-HDA.
In keeping with the demands of urbanisation in Malaysia, Sunway 
plans to focus on devoting more attention to the lifestyle aspect of 
its residential property developments, as well as the integration of 
infrastructure developments as part of community building efforts. 
The SDDA design philosophy will continue to set the tone for 
integrating sustainable design practices in alignment with market 
preferences and regulatory environments. Sunway will also continue 
to explore innovative solutions for senior living and healthcare 
facilities alongside technological innovations such as telemedicine 
as demand for multigenerational and senior-friendly spaces grows.
In strengthening its environmental commitments, the division aims 
to enhance resource management strategies into its developments 
to reduce the embodied carbon footprint and lifetime emissions 
of its property creations in supporting the Group’s net zero carbon 
goals and realising its vision of innovating a better tomorrow.
With these future-focused strategies in place and supported 
by RM4.1 billion remaining in unbilled sales and 2,467 acres 
of landbank available for future developments, the Property 
Development division is optimistic about its outlook in FY 2024.

HEALTHCARE
As the global economy continued its post-pandemic recovery, 
the year 2023 kicked off with a positive outlook for Malaysia’s 
healthcare sector. Hospitals were expected to record a strong 
performance with a significant rebound in the number of local and 
foreign patient visits, with private healthcare in particular poised to 
continue gaining traction.
According to a report by the United Nations World Tourism 
Organisation, Malaysia’s healthcare travel revenue reached RM1.3 
billion in 2022, outperforming global and Asia-Pacific tourism 
recovery rates. The strong recovery in the country’s medical tourism 
sector has prompted the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council 
(“MHTC”) to revise its healthcare traveller revenue target for 2023 
upwards to RM1.7 billion. The country saw an influx of healthcare 
traveller arrivals stemming from pent-up demand during the 
pandemic.
Despite this positive forecast, Sunway Healthcare Group (“Sunway 
Healthcare” or “SHG”) faced its fair share of challenges in FY 2023. 
Rising interest rates, the weakening of MYR against the USD and 
EUR, inflationary pressures and a shortage of nurses led to higher 
operating and capital expenditure including cost of construction 
for new hospitals. The annual medical inflation rate in Malaysia 
peaked at 15% in 2023, further denting the average household’s 
private medical care affordability. On a wider scale, the international 
medical sector braced for the significant risk of a worldwide 
slowdown should geopolitical conflicts escalate, namely in terms of 
potential supply chain disruptions that would further affect prices of 
medical equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals. 
To counter these challenges, several initiatives to improve the 
overall performance of the country’s medical sector were launched. 
The Malaysian government has pledged to gradually elevate public 
healthcare expenditure to 5% of the country’s gross domestic product 
(“GDP”) to help drive health reforms. In June 2023, the Malaysian 
Parliament passed the Health White Paper, which outlined a 15-
year plan to structurally reform the national healthcare system. 
The addressable market in healthcare also saw continued growth due 
to the increasingly ageing population. Furthermore, advancements 
in medical technologies in diagnosis and treatments have enabled 
SHG to achieve new breakthroughs, meet demands and stay ahead 
of the competition. 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
▶ Sunway Medical Centre Sunway City
Focusing on Business Expansion
As part of its business expansion plans, SHG has ramped up progress 
on the hospital expansions. Its flagship hospital, Sunway Medical 
Centre (“SMC”) Sunway City added additional capacity with the 
opening of two new blocks, Tower D and Tower E in May 2023. 
On 6 June 2023, SHG unveiled its maiden senior living residence, 
known as Sunway Sanctuary, which sits atop Tower D of SMC from 
Level 15 to 30. It is one of SHG’s aspirations to provide an exquisite 
and conducive post-retirement living facility, anchoring on six key 
pillars, namely convenient location, holistic wellness, active lifestyle 
with curated activities, thoughtful amenities, elegant living and 
quality healthcare. 
Construction of Sunway Medical Centre Damansara and Sunway 
Medical Centre Ipoh hospitals are on track to be completed by Q3 
and Q4 2024 respectively, with operations expected to commence by 
the end of 2024 and early 2025 respectively. SHG also plans to add 
more dedicated wards and operating theatres for selected disciplines 
to expand its specialised services in the three hospitals already in 
operations. 
Driving Clinical Excellence and Technological Advancements
Sunway remains dedicated to strengthening its digital health offerings 
and technological advancements in medical treatment. In FY 2023, 
SHG continued to strengthen its clinical excellence focusing on key 
disciplines such as Oncology, Orthopaedics, Cardiology, Neurology, 
Gastroenterology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Paediatric services. 
Meanwhile, SMC Sunway City also expanded its lab services in 
transplant immunology, cytogenetic screening and next generation 
sequencing. It further strengthened its Quality Assurance Programme 
that involves regular audits, peer reviews and performance evaluations.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Improving Quality of Care Through Digitalisation
In FY 2023, Sunway Healthcare prioritised ongoing implementation 
and upgrades of digital platforms to boost customer satisfaction 
through stronger operational efficiency and reduced waiting times. 
SHG is also eyeing improvements in its data intelligence and analytic 
capability. SMC Sunway City successfully completed its migration to 
the new Hospital Information System (“HIS”) in August 2023, and 
aims to transition fully to the Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”) 
system by the first half of 2024. The EMR system provides healthcare 
professionals with quick access to accurate, up-to-date, and complete 
information about patients for more coordinated and efficient care, as 
well as more accurate diagnosis. 
Other digitalisation initiatives implemented include the enhancement 
of touchpoints on the SunMed Go mobile platform to improve overall 
patient experience. Automated dispensing cabinets have also been 
introduced to SHG’s hospital wards.
Growing Medical Tourism and Interstate Market
As Malaysia’s reputation as a medical tourism and interstate market 
destination grows, SHG has been at the forefront of contributing to 
its growth. The division focused its efforts in FY 2023 on expanding 
its geographical reach beyond Malaysia through deep and pioneer 
outreach in Tier 1 and 2 cities in Indonesia, set-up of referral agents 
in Indo-China (Cambodia, Vietnam and Yangon) and China, as well as 
collaborations with international insurance companies and medical 
assistance providers. For international health travellers, Sunway 
Sanctuary provided the added convenience of staying in close 
proximity to SMC Sunway City.
Prioritising Healthcare Talent Development
Internally, SHG placed continued emphasis in FY 2023 on human 
capital development through talent upskilling and reskilling, strategic 
leadership training and succession planning. Career advancement 
opportunities such as nursing sponsorships and post-basic studies 
are made available to staff, along with enhanced staff welfare and 
remuneration packages. 
Staff also benefit from SHG’s collaborations and partnerships with 
world-renown institutions such as Harvard Medical School for the 
Leadership in Medicine (LiM) programme, and the Royal College of 
Physicians for the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians 
(MRCP) Practical Assessment of Clinical Examination Skills (PACES) 
preparatory course and mock exams.
SHG also continues to look out for staff wellbeing through the provision 
of mental health support and awareness programmes that focus on 
counselling, career development advice and stress management, 
among other areas.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Malaysian Market Expansion
SHG’s market expansion efforts yielded significant milestones 
throughout FY 2023. SMC Sunway City received its certificate of 
completion for Towers D and E in February 2023 and successfully 
completed the acquisition of Towers A and B in August 2023 
from Sunway REIT. Since May 2023, the hospital has ramped 
up operations with its number of available beds increased to 
724 (up from 616 beds in 2022) along with additional clinical 
spaces and approximately 1,050 units of parking space. This 
brings SHG’s total licensed beds to 1,148 as at 31 December 
2023 together with further increase in bed capacity at SMC 
Velocity and SMC Penang during the year. 
Additionally, SHG’s elegant senior living facility Sunway 
Sanctuary commenced Phase 1 of its operations on 6 June 
2023, with a capacity of 235 rooms providing specially curated 
and holistic wellness experiences and quality healthcare, being 
annexed to SMC Sunway City.
FY 2023 also marked a year of remarkable growth for Sunway 
TCM Centre, which has evolved from one shoplot in Sunway GEO 
to three shoplots with services covering oncology, orthopaedics, 
gynaecology and infertility, paediatrics, mental health, 
dermatology and internal medicine. It is also now recognised as 
a clinical teaching centre for Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman.
Delivering Revenue Growth
In FY 2023, SHG delivered total revenue of close to RM1.5 
billion, marking the third consecutive year of revenue growth 
exceeding 30% on the back of increased patient inflows. SMC 
Sunway City achieved total foreign patient revenue of RM120 
million in FY 2023, representing year-on-year growth of 
61% and foreign patient revenue mix of 11%, while Sunway 
Specialist Centre Damansara saw an overall census increase 
of 11% compared to 2022, with operating theatre procedures 
increasing 53% over the previous year. 
Despite the gestation period typical of new hospital operations, 
SMC Penang exceeded expectations and delivered its first 
positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortisation (“EBITDA”) in January 2023, within the first 
quarter of operations and achieved a positive profit before tax 
(“PBT”) within just one year of commencing operations.
Corporate Development Highlights
Sunway’s Property Development division signed a Memorandum 
of Understanding (“MoU”) with Putrajaya Holdings Sdn Bhd 
to explore medical, education, commercial and hospitality 
opportunities for development in Putrajaya. The collaboration 
will see the development of commercial land in Precincts 7 
and 8 within the administrative capital, as well as the potential 
development of a new medical centre.
At the same time, the Property Development division has also 
sealed two MoU with the Land Custody and Development 
Authority and Yayasan Sarawak to transform 119 acres of prime 
land in Kuching into a state-of-the-art Digital Medical Village 
Development and the proposed redevelopment of a 497-acre 
urban renewal area in Bukit Assek, Sibu respectively.
Enhancing Clinical Excellence and Customer Satisfaction
Sunway Fertility Centre became Reproductive Technology 
Accreditation Committee (“RTAC”)-certified following its 
achievement in providing fertility services in accordance with 
international quality standards. SMC Velocity also successfully 
completed its Malaysian Society for Quality in Health (“MSQH”) 
accreditation. 
Sunway Healthcare acquired its third “da Vinci Xi” robotic 
assisted surgical system in 2023, with two machines in SMC 
Sunway City and another in SMC Penang. SMC Penang is the 
first hospital in the Northern region to carry out robotic assisted 
surgery, which will further enhance patient outcomes for 
minimally invasive surgeries (“MIS”) that offers faster recovery, 
less pain, shorter hospitalisation, and minimal cuts. SMC 
Sunway City has since carried out over 2,000 robotic surgeries 
to date.
 
With a focus on paediatric care, SMC Sunway City is the first 
private hospital in Malaysia to introduce a dedicated Children 
Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department, a one-stop centre 
that caters to the healthcare needs of infants, children and 
adolescents. Together with Fourier Intelligence, SMC Sunway 
City also unveiled Southeast Asia’s first “TRoom”, a special 
sensory playroom with immersive technology and physical 
devices designed to help patients by stimulating the senses. The 
T-Room can be used in medical treatment to assess physical 
performance and help with learning.
Giving Back to Communities
SMC Velocity launched the “Save a Number, Save a Life” 
campaign in August 2023 to educate the public on the 
importance of knowing the emergency contact numbers of their 
nearest healthcare institutions. Through this initiative, SMC 
Velocity became the first private hospital in Malaysia to publish 
a First Aid e-Book that saw close to 3,000 downloads and over 
10,000 scans in the first month of its launch alone.
Following that, SHG also published a Paediatric First Aid e-Book 
and related videos and conducted children’s First Aid workshops 
at SMC Sunway City, attended by nearly 200 children and 
parents, in February 2024.
In a continuous effort to create awareness on diabetes’ 
management, risks and prevention, Sunway Healthcare 
launched the KNOW Diabetes risk calculator in 2023 with an 
accompanying social media campaign and educational videos. 
The campaign generated more than 260,000 video views, and 
nearly 1,500 used the risk calculator, with 150 registered for 
free diabetes screenings.
Sunway Healthcare also placed emphasis on the diagnosis, 
treatment and prevention of cancer, with its RM2.5 million 
Sunway Cancer Support Fund to provide up to 2,000 free 
screenings for the top four cancers in the country, as well as 
subsidies for selected cancer treatments. Although launched 
in October 2022, most of the disbursements and free cancer 
screenings took place in 2023, with approximately RM920,000 
utilised from the Fund as of December 2023.
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In a move aimed at nurturing the next generation of healthcare 
professionals, Sunway Healthcare and Universiti Tunku 
Abdul Rahman (“UTAR”) signed an MoU in October 2023 
to sponsor students pursuing a Bachelor of Nursing degree. 
This sponsorship which covers tuition fees and allowances will 
provide aspiring nurses the opportunity to commence their 
studies and subsequent career in nursing and healthcare.
Environmental Initiatives
SHG’s environmental focus for 2023 included spreading 
recycling and waste segregation awareness and engagement 
among all employees. Some of the other initiatives undertaken 
involved a chiller replacement at SMC Sunway City Towers 
A & B which is currently still on-going, recycling of non-
contaminated IV drip bags at SMC Velocity and the installation 
of a food composting machine at SMC Sunway City Tower 
E to reduce waste by composting food waste. The compost 
generated is used as natural fertiliser for plants surrounding 
the hospital.
Going forward in 2024, SHG aims to build on these initiatives 
by increasing recycling activities by 20% from 2023 to divert 
4% of waste from landfills and a monthly average of 1 tonne 
of food converted to diverted waste from the food composting 
machine. The chiller replacement once completed in 2 to 3 
years, is expected to generate an energy savings of 1,503,070 
kWh/year.
Awards and Recognition
Sunway Healthcare’s hospitals received numerous accolades 
in FY 2023. These include SMC Sunway City winning the 
2023 Hospital of the Year Award for by Healthcare Asia, and 
Silver in the Asia Pacific Stevie Awards for Innovation in Sales 
and Revenue Generation. Additionally, SMC Velocity received 
the 2023 Emerging Hospital Company of the Year Award by 
Frost & Sullivan. 
SMC Sunway City has achieved another milestone on its 
journey towards excellence, being officially recognised 
and certified with ISO 45001 by SIRIM QAS International, 
as a testament to its commitment to maintain the highest 
standards of Occupational Health and Safety. The ISO 45001 
certification reflects the continuous efforts to prioritise the 
well-being of everyone within the facility. It underscores 
dedication in maintaining a workplace that promotes health, 
safety, and an overall positive atmosphere.
In addition, Newsweek Magazine also ranked SMC Sunway 
City #28 in Asia Pacific and top in Malaysia for Paediatrics in 
the Best Specialised Hospitals Asia Pacific Newsweek ranking. 
Additionally, in the same rankings, the hospital was ranked 
#45 in Neurology, #65 in Cardiology and #71 in Oncology in 
Asia Pacific.
Recently, Sunway Medical Centre was named in the top 250 
hospitals globally in Newsweek World’s Best Hospitals 2024 
rankings. This is the first time Malaysian hospitals have been 
ranked in the top 250.
Please see pages 13 & 14 for more information on the Healthcare 
division’s awards and accolades.
The healthcare sector is projected to show sustained growth in 
2024, bolstered by consistent demand for medical services, the 
medical tourism trend, close collaborations between the public 
and private sectors, and the Health Ministry’s increased budget 
allocation. The long-term forecast for the industry also looks bright 
given the country’s ageing population and rising occurrences of 
both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Healthcare 
spending in Malaysia is forecast to rise by 7.7% over the next 
five years.
Supported by this positive outlook, Sunway Healthcare will 
continue its business expansion efforts to accommodate the 
steadily growing number of medical visitors. New hospitals 
currently under construction include SMC Damansara and SMC 
Ipoh, with target commencement dates in the latter half of 
FY 2024 and early FY 2025 respectively. Plans to build more 
medical centres in Sunway Iskandar Puteri, Paya Terubong and 
Kota Bahru are also underway.
These projects will be also be accompanied by the expansion of 
Sunway Healthcare’s network of ambulatory and complementary 
services which will provide the existing hospitals services such 
as ambulatory care centres, home healthcare, senior living and 
TCM centres.
Beyond Malaysia, Sunway Healthcare aims to increase its 
market share by reaching out to international markets such as 
Indo-China and South Asia. It will also leverage the strength 
of its partnerships with Cambridge University, Royal College of 
Physicians, Royal Papworth Hospital (UK) for medical education, 
training, knowledge transfer and conducting research and clinical 
trials led by Sunway Medical Centre Clinical Research Centre.
FUTURE ORIENTATION
Building on its achievements in FY 2023, Sunway Healthcare will 
continue to pursue clinical, operational and financial excellences 
and explore new cutting-edge technologies to enhance

CONSTRUCTION
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
Malaysia’s construction industry continued to chart a strong post-pandemic recovery rate throughout 2023, displaying year-on-year 
growth of 7.5% on the back of the government’s expansionary fiscal spending and steady progress in private and public sector projects.
Amid this domestic environment, Sunway Construction Group Berhad (“SunCon”) still faced a sluggish global economic backdrop 
mired by inflation and the spillover effects of geopolitical tensions on operating costs and disruptions to supply chains, shipping 
and logistics. Prices of raw building materials such as cement and steel bars surged due to high production costs and improving 
post-pandemic demand. Furthermore, the adverse impact of climate change presented itself through extreme weather conditions, 
heatwaves, storms and floods which affected construction work schedules. On a more positive note, labour shortage presented less 
problems in 2023 compared to the previous year as more foreign workers returned to Malaysia.
▶ Rapid Transit System Link (RTS Link) between Johor Bahru and Singapore
Despite the challenges faced, SunCon has managed to fortify its 
position as Malaysia’s leading vertically integrated construction 
company by emphasising efficient project execution and delivery, 
remaining agile and growing its core business while also exploring 
bold new opportunities to stay ahead of the competition. 
In line with growing inclination towards technology-oriented 
construction projects, SunCon’s growth areas in FY 2023 included 
ventures into non-conventional and advanced technology facilities 
sectors, namely data centres and global distribution centre warehouses. 
This was anchored by conventional construction projects such as the 
Rapid Transit System Link (“RTS Link”), as well as in-house projects 
encompassing medical centres, shopping malls, mixed developments 
and high-rise residential buildings. SunCon also explored regional 
growth opportunities in India, Singapore and Vietnam.
This is complemented by the full-scale implementation of digitalisation 
in project management to enhance operational efficiency and ensure 
SunCon maintains high operability and readiness.

STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Please see page 36 for more information on the Construction 
division’s Strategic Snapshot.
Additionally, SunCon continued to invest in its greatest asset, the 
workforce, to ensure ongoing efficiency, productivity and upskilling 
as the division undertakes more advanced technology facilities 
projects such as data centres, semiconductor plants, warehouses 
and power plants. The well-being of all employees is prioritised 
through a safe, healthy and conducive work environment and human 
capital development programmes that enhance their professional 
competencies and career opportunities.
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Leveraging on its strong foundations, SunCon’s business 
strategies have yielded strong results and enabled it to advance 
its sustainability agenda through green construction initiatives. 
In addition, SunCon has continued to make new strides in 
digitalisation and human capital to advance its business 
processes and generate greater long-term business value for 
stakeholders.
Orderbook Highlights
With the construction industry back in full swing and gaining 
renewed post-pandemic momentum, SunCon successfully 
completed the construction of three major building projects in 
FY 2023. Other ongoing building projects saw good progress 
such as the data centres in Johor, Sunway Medical Centre 
hospitals in Ipoh and Damansara, Sunway Flora Residence in 
Bukit Jalil, Sunway Belfield in KL, Plot B of Sunway Velocity 
Two in KL, and Sunway Square in Bandar Sunway.
Other significant achievements included the completion of the 
LRT3 Package GS07&08 infrastructure project, along with 
the remaining work scope for Package GS06 as part of the 
variation order to Package GS07&08. On the global front, in 
India, SunCon has substantially completed the physical works 
for the Meensurutti - Chidambaram Highway in Tamil Nadu in 
2023, while the Thorapalli Agraharam - Jittandahalli Highway 
is targeted for completion by the end of 2024. 
Building on the strength of its track record, SunCon secured 
a number of new major projects during the year. Among them 
are design and build work for Daiso Global Distribution Centre 
Warehouse in Port Klang with a contract value of RM595 million 
through a joint venture arrangement with Kajima Malaysia, as 
well as the second Data Centre project located in Sedenak, Johor 
comprising of 2 packages totaling RM291 million. SunCon was 
also awarded the RM605 million RTS Link project Package 1B 
and 5 from Mass Rapid Transit System Sdn Bhd, stretching 
from Johor Bahru in Malaysia to Woodlands in Singapore. In 
June 2023, SunCon secured a RM253 million contract from 
Sunway REIT for the refurbishment of Sunway Carnival Mall in 
Seberang Jaya, Penang. 
As part of its regional expansion efforts, SunCon has signed a 
preliminary contract for the Song Hau 2 power plant in Vietnam 
which included an extended notice to proceed period. Upon 
receiving the notice to proceed, SunCon will be able to carry out 
Phase 1 and 2 of the project.
For FY 2023, SunCon surpassed its order book replenishment 
target of RM2.0 billion with a total of RM2.5 billion in new 
orders.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Integrated Construction and Prefabrication Hub
SunCon marked a substantial milestone in July 2023 with the 
commencement of operations of the Integrated Construction and 
Prefabrication Hub (“ICPH”) in Pulau Punggol Barat, Singapore. 
The fully automated ICPH is Singapore’s largest in size with 
a total production capacity of up to 100,000m3 of precast 
components per year. The ICPH has energy saving features such 
as a wastewater recycling function built into the tower batching 
plant. The plant will also cater to the robust demand for precast 
components for the rising number of Housing and Development 
Board (HDB) flats in development.
Sustainability Advancements
The division’s ESG efforts were well recognised and as a result, its 
ranking by the MSCI Index which measures a company’s resilience 
to long-term, financially relevant ESG risks was maintained at ‘AA’ 
status in FY 2023 for the second consecutive year. 
In FY 2023, SunCon demonstrated notable growth in its 
sustainability journey with 2 ongoing large-scale solar (LSS) 
projects and 6 completed sustainable energy projects. Moreover, 
SunCon secured a solar energy quota of 29.9-megawatt (“MW”) 
from the Energy Commission under the Corporate Power 
Programme (“CGPP”), along with several separate rooftop solar 
projects. Construction of the District Cooling System in Sunway 
Square, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, has also commenced and is 
on track for completion in FY 2025.
Recognising the growing importance of good Environmental, Social 
and Governance (“ESG”) management, especially with regards to 
supply chain practices, SunCon conducted social assessments on 
all of its contractors and suppliers in FY 2023, with topics ranging 
from forced and bonded labour to provision of accommodations. It 
also engaged 2 major commodities suppliers for insights on ESG, 
emission reduction strategies and transition plans.
Digitalisation
Given the growing scope, complexity and ambition of its projects, 
SunCon has leveraged on the digitalisation approach to optimise 
the quality, efficiency, and productivity of its work processes. 
FY 2023 saw digitalisation being fully implemented in project 
management for all newly awarded projects, as well as the duration 
of the projects’ lifecycle. This was supported by the successful 
introduction of new communication channels and tools using the 
Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) software, which facilitates 
smoother interaction among project stakeholders.
Please see page 14 for more information on the Construction 
division’s awards and accolades.
Awards and Recognition
SunCon is proud to be the recipient of numerous awards and 
recognitions in FY 2023. For sustained business growth and 
operational excellence, SunCon received the Highest Return on 
Equity Over Three Years award for the fifth year in a row awarded 
by The Edge Billion Ringgit Club Awards 2023.
Autodesk ASEAN Innovation Awards 2023 which recognises 
companies that embrace digital technologies and integrated cloud 
workflows for end-to-end digital project delivery awarded SunCon 
as the country winner in the category of the Cloud Advocate of the 
Year Award.
SunCon clinched the Silver award in the Governance category 
at the 9th Asia Integrated Reporting Awards (AIRA) 2023. The 
AIRA awards are dedicated to honouring reports that embody 
transparency, integrated thinking and value creation, and are 
regarded as one of the highest recognitions in integrated reporting 
in the region.
In addition, SunCon also emerged as the Platinum Excellence 
Award winner in recognition of its corporate and sustainability 
reporting at the National Annual Corporate Reporting Awards 
(NACRA) 2023 for companies with less than RM2 billion in 
market capitalisation.
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
▶ Largest integrated construction and prefabrication hub in Singapore
▶ HELIOSEL Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System - Package L3 project
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Economic experts predict a stronger performance from the domestic 
construction sector in 2024 with the expected roll-out of new and 
ongoing mega infrastructure projects in the later part of 2023. 
A total of RM90 billion in development expenditure was also 
announced under Budget 2024, including the MRT3 and Penang 
LRT projects. SunCon is poised to capitalise on these opportunities 
with its full-fledged integrated capabilities ranging from turnkey, 
design and build, and engineering, procurement, construction and 
commissioning (EPCC) to private funding initiatives. The division 
maintains a healthy orderbook of RM5.3 billion extending into 2025 
and is actively working towards replenishing its orderbook.
Malaysia’s data sector is expected to see a rapid uptick in its already 
robust demand. In line with the government’s plan to transform 
Malaysia into a thriving regional data centre hub, a slew of new 
and emerging investments of over 800MW capacity is projected to 
come on stream in phases over the next five years. TNB has also 
established the Green Lane Pathway, an exclusive and strategic 
offering for Malaysia’s data centre market to provide environmentally 
responsible solutions for data centre operators, further bolstering 
Malaysia’s data centre market and encourage more investment 
into its data centres. SunCon is keen to explore new long-term 
opportunities to grow its portfolio in this sector in the coming years, 
along with collaborations in logistics warehouses and semiconductor 
manufacturing. 
FUTURE ORIENTATION
For a detailed discussion of SunCon’s business model, performance, 
strategies, risk and outlook, please refer to Sunway Construction Group 
Berhad’s Annual Report 2023.
Meanwhile, the future of the sustainable energy sector looks bright 
as renewable energy (“RE”) adoption surges ahead of the country’s 
RE target mix of 70% by 2050. The government is lending solid 
support in the form of policies and measures such as the Net 
Energy Transition Roadmap, lifting of the RE export ban and Bursa 
Carbon Exchange programmes. SunCon will continue to advance its 
sustainability journey towards enabling sustainable construction, 
investing in a fair, safe and inclusive workplace, and ensuring 
compliance and embracing transparency. This includes recommitting 
its net zero target by 2040 and reinforcing Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
reduction targets of 40% reduction by 2030 through the Carbon 
Reduction Pathway and Strategy. SunCon also plans to undertake a 
comprehensive climate risk assessment in 2024.
SunCon remains vigilant of potential inflationary and geopolitical 
pressures that may affect the pace of economic growth. However, 
the division is cautiously optimistic for further positive growth and 
expansion in 2024, bolstered by its strong position and ability to rise 
to the challenges and opportunities of a highly dynamic industry.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
PROPERTY INVESTMENT 
AND REIT
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
The Property Investment and REIT division of Sunway entered FY 2023 with caution, amidst moderate inflation and persistent 
monetary tightening by key central banks across the world while businesses and households adjust to the escalating costs driven by 
supply chain disruption, foreign labour shortage, strengthening of the US dollar and a weakened China economy. Although the world 
economy remains in a state of flux with new geopolitical risks emerging, Malaysia’s economy remained resilient, anchored by strong 
domestic demand coupled with strong policies by an increasingly stable government. 
Lifting of policies that hinder international travel after the pandemic saw the retail segment experiencing a resurgence from pent-up 
demand for travelling, entertainment and socialisation, especially during the festive and holiday seasons. This shows that malls are 
still relevant, with the stronger ones seeming to thrive the most, while e-commerce is expected to transform rather than replace the 
role of physical malls. 
However, the Klang Valley office market continued to experience downward pressure due to the existing excess supply of old office 
building space and incoming new supply of office buildings. An influx of about 3.5 million sq ft of new office space entering the 
market in the second half of the year has further heightened competition in rental rates, leasing incentives and occupancy levels 
of office buildings in the Klang Valley. Many of these new offices are green building certified as multinational and local companies 
have placed increasing importance on environmental and social requirements in building and office designs. Demand for co-working 
spaces are also increasing among SMEs and MNCs as they will have the flexibility that allows them to scale up and down quickly and 
economically.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
To safeguard its market position against the inflow of new retail 
and office spaces, Sunway’s Property Investment and REIT 
division was proactive in identifying opportunities to improve 
the operational performance of their existing assets portfolio, 
undertaking Asset Enhancement Initiatives (“AEI”) and Asset 
Management Initiatives to expand its Net Lettable Area (“NLA”) 
and boost income and property yields. This is particularly 
important to maintain the relevance of their assets and enhance 
their property values in a fiercely competitive real estate market. 
Among the key AEI initiatives undertaken were the RM360 million 
refurbishment of Sunway Carnival Mall’s existing wing, which 
encompasses optimising the layout, integrating the aesthetics 
of the external façade, and providing seamless connectivity for 
the enlarged mall to meet the burgeoning demand from Penang 
mainland’s growing population. The refurbishment is targeted 
to complete in 2025 which will see the total NLA of the mall 
increased to 752,000 sq ft. The division has also set aside 
close to RM200 million to reconfigure 320,000 square feet of 
retail space at Sunway Pyramid Mall into specialty stores. The 
reconfiguration aims to improve and revitalise the tenancy mix 
to cater to the changing consumers trends and lifestyles and to 
further elevate the shopping experience at the mall. The target 
completion and reopening is expected in the final quarter of FY 
2024. 
The tenancy mix at all the malls continued to be refreshed to 
ensure that trending brands are captured to strengthen the brand 
position for Sunway’s malls to stay ahead of the competition 
and generate higher footfalls. Some of the new brands which 
have opened in Sunway’s malls are Ralph Lauren, Tai Er, Laem 
Charoen, Maisen, Gordon Ramsay Street Pizza, Anta Kids and 
many more.
At the same time, the division also look for ways to rejuvenate 
and optimise the spaces in the retail and commercial segments 
by exploring co-working spaces and experiential hub strategy. 
Beyond asset driven initiatives, Sunway’s Property Investment 
and REIT division also worked on initiatives to strengthen its ESG 
credentials. This includes establishing green financing options, 
and exploring ways to support Sunway’s malls’ retail partners on 
their sustainability journey. The division also actively pursued 
green accreditations and ratings, benchmarking its operations to 
international best practices and global ratings to raise the bar on 
sustainability. Sunway REIT had laid out a 10-year roadmap to 
have all its buildings green-certified before 2034 to enhance the 
competitiveness of its assets. 
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Please see page 37 for more information on the Property Investment 
and REIT division’s Strategic Snapshot. 
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Retail segment
The retail segment of the Property Investment and REIT 
division ended FY 2023 on a strong note, surpassing its FY 
2022 record performance with a commendable 5% sales 
growth. The achievement was attributed to the double-
digit growth by Sunway Carnival Mall, resilient out-of-home 
dining, and robust festive spending in the first quarter of FY 
2023 across all Sunway’s malls which helped to ease the 
moderation effect of the remaining quarters in FY 2023.
Notably, the replacement of AEON supermarket with Jaya 
Grocer has strengthened Sunway Pyramid Mall’s positioning 
as a mid-high premium mall, while Sunway Carnival Mall 
has been enjoying major growth since its expansion, and is 
poised to be the leading mall in the Northern Region. The 
well-curated tenancy mix of these two malls successfully 
drove an increase in its sales and traffic, and generated 
higher rents per square foot. The retail segment boasts 4.9 
million sq ft in total NLA.
At Sunway Putra Mall, in collaboration with Sunway Lagoon 
theme park, an 80’s-themed indoor roller-skating park, Sk8te 
City opened in April 2023 to provide a new entertainment 
spot in the city and generate more footfall to the mall. WORQ 
coworking space had leased over 20,000 sq ft of space 
in the mall to provide a minimalist workspace with a wide 
range of amenities and facilities to foster collaboration and 
connections since January 2024.
In FY 2023, Sunway’s malls continue to be recognised for 
its efforts to create great customers’ experiences. Sunway 
Velocity Mall was the sole Malaysian mall winner at the 
International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) MAXI 
Awards 2023 awards that saw 100 finalists from around the 
world - including from Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, 
United States, and China. The MAXI Awards recognises 
innovative events, programmes and technology that add 
value to the mall industry. The mall won Gold for its Chinese 
New Year 2022 “100 Blessings” under the Marketing 
Excellence Community category and another Gold award 
for its New Year’s Eve Countdown concert celebrating 2023 
under the Marketing Excellence Experiential category. 
Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPKM) also awarded 
Sunway Carnival Mall with a Platinum award for its Cahaya 
Raya x Autsome 2023 event under ’Best Experiential 
Marketing Awards – Category B (Net Lettable Area 500,001 
to 999,999 sq ft)’.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Commercial segment
The commercial segment continued to sustained its performance 
in FY 2023 supported by a stable average occupancy rates and 
the division’s AEI efforts to upgrade the infrastructures of the 
commercial buildings in the portfolio. 
During the year, two commercial buildings obtained its Certificate 
of Completion and Compliance and started operations, namely 
Sunway V2 Tower in Sunway Velocity Kuala Lumpur and Wisma 
Sunway Big Box in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri, Johor, adding a 
combined NLA of approximately 562,000 sq ft to the division’s 
assets under management. 
Sunway REIT completed the divestment of its Sunway Medical 
Centre (Tower A and B) in August 2023 and is in the midst of 
applying to lift the Free Industrial Zone (“FIZ”) status for its 
Sunway REIT Industrial – Petaling Jaya 1, paving the way for 
Sunway REIT to pursue leasing prospects and business activities 
with non-FIZ compliant companies. Currently, Sunway REIT has 
three new proposed acquisition of assets totalling RM802 million 
pending completion. 
Digital transformation
Beyond securing reputable tenants and ensuring steady income 
streams from its property portfolio, the value of the division’s assets 
continued to be enhanced through the adoption of technological 
advancements and sustainability features. For instance, the 
introduction of a lift card access system and installation of fibre 
optic cables to each office floor of Sunway Putra Tower effectively 
increased the building’s security and data transmission speed. 
This supported Sunway Putra Tower’s attainment of Stage 1 
Malaysia Digital approval on 26 October 2023, elevating its 
competitiveness in the office segment. 
Other enhancements such as the implementation of Smart 
Washroom in Sunway Pyramid Mall also earned praise in the 
social media, as the modernised washroom improved the comfort 
of visitors while its smart features allowed the mall to track and 
prevent water leakages, track usage and refills of tissues and 
soap, and improved the overall hygiene of the washrooms.
ESG initiatives
The division has implemented various initiatives to reduce the 
carbon and waste footprints across its malls over the years. These 
initiatives are showing improved results in FY 2023.
Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels installed at 5 of the malls’ rooftops 
have generated over 6 million kilowatt hours of solar energy which 
is worth almost RM2 million in cost savings to partly offset the 
rising utilities cost for the malls. 
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FUTURE ORIENTATION
Additional information on REIT-related performance and outlook are 
discussed in detail in Sunway Real Estate Investment Trust’s Integrated 
Annual Report 2023.
Going to FY 2024, the growth of the Malaysian economy is 
expected to trend higher, supported by an increasingly stable 
domestic environment. While the division looks forward with 
optimism, it takes cognisance of several key headwind themes 
in 2024 such as service tax hikes and new taxes, roll-back of 
subsidies, electricity tariff hikes, persistent inflationary outlook 
and the global economic developments which will present both 
challenges and opportunities. 
The trend of domestic retail mall expansion seen in 2023 is 
expected to continue into 2024. While new malls introduce 
competition, they also enrich Malaysia’s retail offerings and 
enhance the country’s appeal as a retail hub. This expansion is 
anticipated to attract not only local shoppers but also international 
visitors, hence, benefitting the economy and the tourism sector. 
Moreover, the evolving retail environment is likely to entice 
globally recognised brands to establish a presence in Malaysia, 
further bolstering the retail sector. In a highly competitive 
market, established malls that adapt quickly to consumer trends 
and lifestyles are poised to attract premium tenants. The Property 
Investment and REIT division aims to continue to strengthen its 
asset portfolios on this front.
In addition to current AEIs to increase NLAs at the retail malls, 
two new additions to the retail malls, Sunway Square in Sunway 
City Kuala Lumpur and Sunway Ipoh Mall in Sunway City Ipoh 
are currently being constructed and expected to be completed by 
the end of 2024 and 2026 respectively, further reinforcing the 
division’s commitment to providing quality retail spaces. These 
new retail malls will add up to 1.3 million sq ft of NLA once in 
operations. 
Parallels can be drawn with the commercial sector in Malaysia, 
which is also seeing an immense amount of incoming supply in 
2023 and 2024. The overhang of vacant office space, especially 
in the Klang Valley, will continue to bear down on rental growth 
prospects and occupancy levels. Nonetheless, the attractive 
rentals in Malaysia may become an attribute to entice relocations 
of more regional offices and MNCs to the country. 
In order to attract such tenants, the division is mindful that its 
properties must embrace green building standards and achieve 
Malaysia Digital (MD) status to enhance the attractiveness and 
sustainability of the commercial portfolio as demand remains 
resilient among more ESG-compliant, wellness-driven and state-
of-the art office buildings. To this end, the commercial segment 
will see two new office blocks at Sunway Square which will enter 
the market towards the end of 2024 and 2025 respectively, 
adding a total NLA of close to 980,000 sq ft of commercial space 
under the division’s assets under management in the future. 
These buildings are designed and built according to Green RE 
Platinum and LEED Gold ratings to cater to the sustainability 
conscious market.
Building on this understanding, Sunway’s Property Investment 
and REIT division emphasise on the importance of continuing 
to identify and implement AEIs to bolster the appeal of its retail 
and commercial portfolios in order to maintain, if not improve, 
its property yield. The division is keen to explore the adoption 
of retention strategies and refurbishment initiatives for its 
commercial segment, such as the addition of amenities like 
gyms, common lounges, event spaces and landscaped areas to 
office buildings to elevate the physical office experience, aimed 
at boosting productivity and creativity among its occupants to 
enhance its appeal. The division is confident that its ongoing 
AEIs will contribute to improved asset yields in the coming years. 
Nonetheless, the division is aware of the potential short-term 
disruptions and closures associated with these enhancements 
impacting the financial performance in FY 2024. With careful 
planning and barring unexpected events, the division maintains a 
cautiously optimistic outlook for the prospects and performance 
in the upcoming year.
In an effort to address food security and provide fresh and diverse 
food in the city, 2,300 sq ft of space was allocated to urban 
farming at Sunway Velocity Mall in 2023, adding to the 1,500 
sq ft of urban farm which was already in operations at Sunway 
Pyramid Mall. 
 
The Green Lease Partnership Programme for all of Sunway REIT’s 
tenants and hotel lessees which was launched in 2022 has seen 
over 80% take up by the retail and office tenants in FY 2023, 
a significant increase from 30% in the previous year. Sunway 
REIT aims to achieve 100% tenant participation with more than 
1,300 tenants in the programme before or by 2030.
Sunway’s malls have also established itself as a leader and 
advocate for sustainability within the retail industry, forming 
a five-way partnership with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Solutions Network (SDSN), Jeffrey Sachs Center 
on Sustainable Development (JSC), Malaysia Retail Association 
(MRA), and Malaysia Retail Chain Association (MRCA) to launch 
the Sustainability Collaboration Alliance Network (SCAN) to 
spearhead sustainability adoption among Sunway’s malls’ 
business partners and the retail industry.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
LEISURE
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
In FY 2023, the Leisure division faced challenges primarily from external economic factors which affected the domestic business 
landscape, dampened consumer confidence and slow recovery in international travels, while the leisure market is still reeling from the 
reduced subsidies and diminished discretionary spending in the post pandemic environment. 
The operating environment is further compounded by the increasing divisiveness within the community, with calls to ban international 
concerts and impose new concert restrictions gaining momentum in FY 2023, impacting event planning and audience attraction amid 
this furore.
Additionally, an observed increase in the frequency of evening rain in FY 2023 had affected the operations of the Night Park, 
highlighting the need for strategic planning to mitigate weather-related business impact and explore alternative revenue streams 
during wet seasons.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In facing these formidable challenges, the Leisure division’s 
proactive response and strategic initiatives played a pivotal role 
in mitigating these impacts. The launch of the Sunway Super App 
mobile application and Sunway Digital Hub during the 2023 STP 
Mega Roadshow, significantly boosted brand visibility and sales 
for both the division’s theme parks. 
Furthermore, Sunway Theme Parks (“STP”) Studios, in 
collaboration with Sunway Super App, initiated a monthly live 
stream as a platform to engage audiences and sell theme park 
products and branded partner items. By diversifying revenue 
streams through digital platforms, Sunway’s Leisure division 
demonstrated an ability to navigate challenges creatively and 
make the most of the evolving consumer trends.
In the year under review, the Leisure division also focused on 
brand partnerships, retail rebranding, and community-focused 
events to navigate the dynamic industry landscape. Partnerships 
with both local and international brands were pursued for STP 
Studios, as well as events, and campaigns to elevate the division’s 
profile and financial performance. 
New attractions, such as the Malayana Rooftop in Sunway Lost 
World of Tambun and the unveiling of a giant Captain Quack statue 
in the Sunway Lagoon Night Park, were strategically introduced 
to enhance visitors’ experience, along with the addition of four 
new staycation villas in Sunway Lagoon, reflecting the division’s 
commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Similarly, 
retail transformation of STP Kedai Runcit stores across Sunway 
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
Please see page 38 for more information on the Leisure 
division’s Strategic Snapshot.
Lagoon, Sunway Lost World of Tambun and Sunway Lost World 
Hotel were carried out to increase customer engagement and 
strengthen overall market positioning.
Aside from the strategic business initiatives, the division also 
recognised the importance of celebrating diversity to cultivate an 
atmosphere of inclusivity in the multicultural Malaysia. Hence, 
the division embarked to unite the people of Malaysia through 
the celebration of the nation’s four main festivities, commencing 
with a grand Deepavali celebration in 2023 with the first-ever 
Thirunaal Kondattam: Festival of Lights Celebration, which 
showcased the division’s commitment to foster a sense of 
community during the national celebrations.
Additionally, in response to growing environmental concerns, the 
division initiated the Explorer Rangers Programme in FY 2022,  
a year-long educational effort designed to encourage greater 
awareness of sustainable and environmental practices among 
the younger generation. With over 500 active members, the 
programme’s success led to its renewal for another year in FY 
2023. Explorer Rangers 2.0 signified the theme parks’ sustained 
commitment to environmental education and community 
involvement. A sustainable biowaste treatment system was also 
implemented to compost food waste in Sunway Lagoon theme 
park, which underscored the division’s dedication to sustainability 
and community well-being.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
FY 2023 was a year marked by remarkable achievements for the Leisure division, particularly in unifying the division’s financial 
strength with innovative visitors’ engagements, and making strong strides in sustainability. Notable highlights include an 
impressive visitorship recovery at both Sunway Lagoon Theme Park and Lost World of Tambun to 2 million from the low of 
600,000 during the pandemic.
Sunway Lagoon Theme Park
The ninth annual Nights of Fright event, which was a 
collaborative effort with The Sudden Impact! Entertainment 
Company from New York, marked a pivotal moment for the 
theme park. Held to the “Fields of Fear” theme, the event 
featured eight themed haunted houses, 11 exhilarating rides 
and two scare zones that showcased elaborate set designs, 
top of the line special effects and performances from close to 
300 professional scare actors. This immersive experience not 
only captivated visitors but also demonstrated the division’s 
commitment to delivering thrilling and memorable adventures. 
In FY 2023, Sunway Lagoon extended its engagement with 
the Sunway Property Reward+ Buyers’ Nite. Held exclusively 
at the Sunway Lagoon Night Park, this occasion represented 
a landmark collaboration for the division and Sunway’s 
Property Development division, which welcomed more than 
1,000 homebuyers and their families to a transformed 
Night Park featuring 16 activities, stage shows, and special 
attractions specially curated for the attendees for a unique 
and personalised experience. Additionally, Sunway Lagoon’s 
international concert series successfully hosted 9 events 
during the year, attracting over 100,000 visitors. 
These achievements and diverse range of offerings underscore 
the park’s versatility, continued appeal and growing ability to 
deliver memorable experiences that cater to a wide range of 
audiences.
Sunway Lost World of Tambun
Sunway Lost World of Tambun welcomed FY 2023 with a 
series of captivating theme park additions and experiences, 
enriching the year-end holiday season for patrons seeking 
an unforgettable adventure. In December 2023, the theme 
park unveiled the Discovery of the Ancient Dragon, an epic 
adventure experience featuring the Eshno trail complete with 
free-roaming wild dragons and other awe-inspiring wonders, 
which provided a magical journey for visitors to the adventure 
park and its many rides. To complement these additions, 
Sunway Lost World of Tambun expanded the Luminous Forest 
with new and interesting attractions, creating a lively landscape 
for patrons seeking continuous surprises and exploration.
Sunway Theme Park Mega Roadshow 2023
Sunway Theme Park’s Mega Roadshow commenced for the 
second time in FY 2023, creating a month-long immersive 
experience across Selangor, Penang, and Johor. During the 
roadshows, super deals, discounts and value-for-money 
packages were offered by the Sunway brands, as well as other 
homegrown Malaysian brands.
This mega event not only saw the launch of the Sunway 
Super App mobile application, but also marked a significant 
milestone in customer engagement for the Group. The Sunway 
Super App, a pioneering venture in Malaysia, seamlessly 
connects users to a vast array of products and services offered 
by Sunway’s diversified business divisions. This strategic move 
not only enhances customer convenience but also solidified 
Sunway’s position as an industry trailblazer, pioneering a new 
era of seamless, integrated experiences for its patrons.

FUTURE ORIENTATION
Looking ahead, Sunway’s Leisure division is focused on enhancing 
its domestic market presence amidst slow international tourist 
arrivals. Recognising that full international tourism recovery 
might stretch into FY 2025, the division is doubling down on its 
efforts to captivate local audiences with exceptional experiences 
tailored to diverse Malaysian preferences.
It remains firm in its commitment to implementing robust cost 
management strategies to grapple with rising costs, ensuring that 
resources are allocated judiciously to maximise value and boost 
efficiency. This proactive approach not only safeguards financial 
sustainability but also positions the division to weather economic 
uncertainties and maintain a competitive edge.
Furthermore, the division braces for economic challenges 
particularly in the first half of FY 2024, while expecting a 
gradual recovery of the leisure sector as the year unfolds. The 
Leisure division is prepared to adjust its strategies in response 
to the ever-changing operating landscape, aiming for sustained 
growth and resilience in value creation for all its stakeholders. 
This includes continuous marketing efforts to ensure a 
consistent and compelling brand presence in the market, and 
dedicating resources to the ongoing enhancements in facilities 
and attractions to set the theme parks’ offerings apart. These 
measures not only mitigate the risks associated with heightened 
competition from new and upcoming theme parks both locally 
and regionally, but also position the division as an industry 
leader, continuously innovating to meet and exceed stakeholders’ 
expectations.
In sculpting this strategic vision, the Leisure division has laid 
the foundation for enduring growth, resilience, and is committed 
to deliver unparalleled leisure experiences. The fusion of market 
emphasis, cost optimisation, adaptability to economic dynamics, 
and strategic risk mitigation positions the Leisure division as 
a robust force in the exciting landscape of entertainment and 
leisure.
Sk8te City
The division extended its influence into urban entertainment 
spaces with the commencement of Sk8te City’s operations 
at Sunway Putra Mall in the second quarter of FY 2023, 
diversifying the division’s operational scope beyond 
traditional amusement parks while demonstrating the 
scalability of its leisure offerings to diverse audiences.
International recognition
Sunway’s leisure attractions continued to garner international 
accolades, with Sunway Lagoon securing the 5 th  position 
and Sunway Lost World of Tambun coming in at 10 th  in the 
Global Attraction Index 2022 under the Top 20 Water Park in 
Asia Pacific category, as awarded by Themed Entertainment 
Association (TEA) and AECOM. This acknowledgment 
affirmed the division’s status as sought-after amusement 
destinations at the forefront of the leisure and entertainment 
industry in the Asia Pacific region.

HOSPITALITY
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
In FY 2023, Sunway’s Hospitality division witnessed a revival in both domestic and international hotel demand, fuelled by the post-
pandemic recovery of social dynamics, increased travel confidence and a heightened desire for leisure activities. Despite this positive 
momentum, the sector faced headwinds due to ongoing domestic economic instability, which led to a decrease in international events 
held in Malaysia, and further impacted by certain government cost-cutting measures, which include limiting official functions to be 
held at public facilities.
Additionally, the division contended with rising operating costs in FY 2023. This included elevated staff remuneration expenses, 
attributed to a labour shortage and the adoption of a 5-day work week, along with burgeoning procurement costs driven up by 
inflationary pressures, a scarcity of raw materials and a depreciating Ringgit.
Emerging trends observed within the sector included guests’ growing dependency on gadgets and a corresponding rise in technological 
adoption within the hospitality industry. A greater embrace of ESG considerations among stakeholders was also noted, which has 
further pushed prioritisation of environmentally friendly practices and led to more stringent regulatory compliance.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
STRATEGIC RESPONSE 
In response to the dynamic interplay of these multitude of 
factors, the Hospitality division adopted a nuanced approach 
in its strategic response that is rooted in the adaptability and 
systemic market positioning for its various hospitality offering 
clusters.
The division employed an adaptive marketing strategy with 
the implementation of variable rates at its hotels, enabling 
continuous rate adjustments based on market demand, supply 
and the competitive landscape to drive the division’s performance 
in terms of occupancy rate and profit margins. These allow each 
hotel to finely tune their pricing and value proposition marketing 
to swiftly adjust to shifting market forces and customer 
expectations at their respective locations.
 
At Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway 
Lagoon Hotel which are located in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur, 
there were active pitching for national and international level 
of Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibition (“MICE”) 
events to be held at Sunway City Kuala Lumpur.
The division had also focused their efforts on diversifying revenue 
streams to shore up the business’ resilience against market shocks 
and other unforeseen events. To this end, the division explored new 
avenues by tapping into wellness tourism, international weddings 
and market diversification into emerging markets, while pursuing 
strategic collaborations to enhance market awareness into these 
markets. The coordinated appointment of hotel representations 
in key geographic areas, including Greater China, Singapore and 
the Middle East, further solidified the division’s global presence 
and contributed to heightened market appreciation.
Additionally, the “Book Direct & Save” website application 
continued to be implemented and improved, with its ease of use 
proving popular among both guests and employees, while guests 
enjoyed the additional benefits and flexibility it provided. 
The Hospitality division also took the initiative to introduce a 
range of upgrades and innovations to its hotel offerings which 
include building facade enhancements at Sunway Putra Hotel 
Kuala Lumpur and transformation of its coffee house lounge into 
an exquisite Rumah Makan Nusantara restaurant and introduction 
of a new Deluxe room category at Sunway Velocity Hotel, among 
others. The hotels also leveraged on the Group’s synergistic 
potential in their room package offerings, such as Sunway Velocity 
Hotel partnered with Sunway Medical Centre Velocity to provide 
pre and post-treatment patient accommodation and Sunway Big 
Box Hotel in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri collaborating with X 
Park for entertainment space, capitalising on these partnerships 
to enhance guest offerings and appeal to a more diverse clientele.
The division also carried out a comprehensive analysis of the 
talent remuneration and benefits plan of the industry and its 
competitive landscape, which served to guide the division’s 
compensation considerations to defray escalating staff costs 
while ensuring alignment with industry standards to facilitate the 
attraction and retention of top talents.

HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Operational Highlights
The business performance for the Hospitality division in FY 
2023 was supported by strong domestic leisure, corporate 
and MICE activities while international arrivals continued to 
improve at a gradual pace. In July 2023, Sunway Resort Hotel 
completed its refurbishment, creating a full room inventory of 
460 rooms.
Occupancy rates at most of the main hotels in Malaysia achieved 
over 60% which is commendable considering that international 
tourists’ arrivals are still slow.
Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon 
Hotel, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur
Sunway Resort Hotel underwent a transformative phase with a 
US$60 million investment which was completed in FY 2023, 
unveiling fresh facilities and family-oriented accommodations. 
Immersive experiences including Waterventure, Wonderland 
Explorers and a rooftop urban farm, in collaboration with 
Sunway XFarms, were introduced, enhancing the family-friendly 
environment. Special family rooms were also added and the 
addition of 17 private pool villas in a tropical garden brought a 
touch of exclusivity. In August 2023, a Spa & Wellness Centre 
was introduced, with signature massages and treatments 
using extracts from Bioessentials. The culinary scene was also 
enriched with the launch of Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes 
in March 2023 and the debut of Gordon Ramsay Street Pizza in 
September 2023 in Sunway City Kuala Lumpur.
With the full opening of all the rooms in Sunway Resort Hotel, 
the hotel introduced the Sunway Moments programme, a 
Sunway Resort Hotel Exclusive Membership Programme which 
offers exceptional dining, accommodation and lifestyle benefits 
for its members. This is complemented with the launch of the 
Sunway Hotels & Resorts mobile application, a custom-built 
application that provides streamlined contactless check-in and 
check-out, introduced keyless floor access and allowed guests 
to manage room settings through their mobile devices. These 
innovative features further enhanced guest experience at its 
flagship hotel.
In a parallel initiative, the division also implemented Hey 
Sunway, a customer engagement solution, providing an AI-
enhanced platform for guests to connect live 24/7 on platforms 
like WhatsApp, Telegram and Line applications.
Other Hotels
The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat’s renovation of its 4 Grand 
Garden Villas and 1 Royal Villa was not only effective in 
revitalising its accommodation offerings but also positioned it 
as a top-tier luxury retreat. During the year under review, The 
Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat diversified its culinary offerings 
with the introduction of a Pizza Station, offering 30 different 
crafted pizzas and a unique gold-plated pizza. Furthermore, the 
reopening of On the Rocks café, serving as another outlet for a 
sunset aperitif, seeks to inject local culture to the retreat and 
also create a new pre-dinner outlet.
Up north, Sunway Hotel Georgetown and Sunway Hotel 
Seberang Jaya saw an improvement in their occupancy 
rates at 81% and 71% respectively in FY 2023, showcasing 
positive market positioning and profitability. The hotels forged 
successful partnerships with nearby business partners such as 
Entopia by the Penang Butterfly Farm in Penang island and 
well-known brand, SuperDry, tailoring these collaborations to 
offer exclusive benefits and enhance guest experiences. 
Sunway Putra Hotel Kuala Lumpur focused its efforts on 
defending its core domestic market by targeting certain 
market sectors for both rooms and event business, while also 
pursuing the Free Independent Traveller (“FIT”) segments 
from neighbouring countries. The strategy proved successful 
with local guests contributing 57% to its overall revenue. 
Strategic measures like flexible rates and the “Book Direct & 
Save” campaign resulted in an increase in Internet Booking 
Engine (“IBE”) growth for the hotel. These initiatives lowered 
reemployment costs, maintained staff retention and secured 
consistent service delivery for the division’s hotels.
Sunway Big Box Hotel in Sunway City Iskandar Puteri also 
curated special accommodation packages in collaboration with 
Legoland Malaysia Resort to cater to its guests’ demand and 
boost hotel occupancy.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
Sustainability Initiatives
Sunway’s Hospitality division has made significant strides in 
adopting sustainable practices across its diverse portfolio. 
This is exemplified by the elimination of print media in 
Sunway Velocity Hotel and Sunway Big Box Hotel, replacing 
it with digital directories on information TV systems. Guest 
feedback collection at Sunway Hotel Georgetown and Sunway 
Hotel Seberang Jaya have also transitioned to using QR codes 
for feedback forms in rooms, as well as department heads’ 
lobby engagements, which successfully achieved a response 
rate of over 98% across platforms. 
Additionally, the hotels continue to stay committed to waste 
reduction and proper waste channelling by donating used 
linen and certifying team members in handling scheduled 
waste. Some of the other sustainability initiatives which have 
been implemented over the years include the introduction 
of drinking water in glass bottles and reduction of single-
use plastic packaging in amenities by replacing it with 
larger refillable bottles with pump dispensers. These efforts 
have helped the division to achieve a notable reduction in 
plastic usage, while collaborations with local authorities and 
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in enhancing city 
cleanliness and sustainable food choices further emphasise 
the hotels’ dedication to environmental stewardship. 
Beyond operational enhancements, Sunway Putra Hotel placed 
a strong emphasis on sustainability with the implementation 
of solutions such as the adoption of interval-based room 
servicing and the recycling of used cooking oil underscore the 
hotel’s commitment to minimising its ecological footprint.
Moreover, the division’s commitment to inclusivity and 
social responsibility is demonstrated through the Job Coach 
Supported Employment programme at these hotels, resulting 
in the employment of two persons with disabilities (“PWD”). 
The receipt of an Energy Audit Conditional Grant for Sunway 
Pyramid Hotel and Sunway Lagoon Hotel further reflects the 
hotels’ commitment to energy efficiency.
Awards and accolades
Most of the hotels under the Hospitality division received 
TripAdvisor Travellers’ Choice 2023 awards which recognised 
accommodations, attractions and restaurants that consistently 
earn great reviews from travellers and are ranked within the top 
10% of properties on TripAdvisor. Sunway Hotel Georgetown 
Penang was also named Trip.com’s Top Producing Hotel 2023 
as a recognition of being the top room nights contributed in 
the year 2023. Furthermore, at the Talentbank Graduates’ 
Choice Awards 2023, Sunway City Kuala Lumpur Hotels 
(Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway Pyramid Hotel and Sunway 
Lagoon Hotel) were awarded first runner-up in the Hotels 
category for Graduates’ Choice of Employer.
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Please see page 15 for more information on Hospitality division’s 
awards & accolades.
FUTURE ORIENTATION
As the Hospitality division looks toward the future, there is a 
collective focus on deliberate executions aimed at enhancing 
operational efficiency, ensuring a consistent guest experience 
and embracing sustainable practices across its diverse portfolio. 
Across all the hotels, the deployment of adjustable rates is poised 
to elevate business yield, backed by accurate statistical reports 
and advanced monitoring software, while revenue diversification 
will remain a key driver as the division venture into new markets, 
attract different guest segments and foster collaborations with 
reputable F&B vendors for diverse dining options. 
At the same time, the Hospitality division recognises the 
significance of the domestic market and aims to capture this 
through enticing deals and packages via IBE for both business 
and leisure segments. Tactical advertisements on social media 
platforms and collaborations with key opinion leaders (“KOL”) 
will further amplify the outreach. 
Additionally, there is a concerted effort to tap into the intra-ASEAN 
market, particularly Singapore and Indonesia, with targeted 
packages, planned advertisements, and publicity through media 
and KOLs. This multifaceted approach is designed to increase 
bookings, optimise room rates, and maximise revenue.
Beyond marketing and tactical adjustments, the division will 
maintain a disciplined focus on cost and energy savings to 
safeguard healthy margins. Simultaneously, a robust strategy 
for staff retention, encompassing engagement, growth plans, 
and opportunities, will contribute to sustaining a consistent and 
exceptional guest experience. 
The Hospitality division is satisfied that these strategies, and 
the meticulous plans put in place to mitigate risks from talent 
attrition and socio-economic shocks, reflect a sound approach 
toward sustained growth, operational excellence and heightened 
guest satisfaction for the division. The commitment to innovation, 
adaptability, and tactical partnerships will continue to position 
Sunway’s Hospitality division for continued success in the 
growing hospitality landscape.

TRADING AND MANUFACTURING
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT STRATEGIC RESPONSE 
The Group’s Trading and Manufacturing division faced a 
challenging operating environment in FY 2023 largely due to the 
global economic uncertainty. This led to interest rate hikes which 
in turn meant higher borrowing costs. The stronger US currency 
also affected import margins, while the slowdown of China’s 
construction industry adversely impacted product demand. 
In Malaysia, the domestic manufacturing sector ended the year on 
a decline largely due to continued weakness in the electrical and 
electronics industry, as well as a weaker export-oriented sector. 
The overall sales value of the domestic manufacturing sector 
totalled RM1.8 trillion in 2023, marking a marginal growth rate 
of 0.2% from 2022. 
FY 2023 also saw a noticeable growth in sustainability trends with 
more businesses adopting green practices, policies and products. 
However, there is still a significant gap between the growth of 
this environmentally friendly shift and the level of consumers’ 
preparedness to adapt to this transition. As such, this gap posed 
a challenge for the division in terms of marketing the commercial 
electric vehicles (EV). Internally, additional costs were also 
incurred in ensuring optimum sustainability compliance.
The Trading and Manufacturing division’s strategic focus in FY 
2023 centred on boosting sales performance while also adapting 
to growing demand for sustainability. Among the strategies 
implemented to increase the division’s revenue stream was 
the introduction of new products and expanding its renewable 
energy product lines to support consumers’ conversion to more 
environmentally friendly products.
In tandem with the division’s business expansion and 
sustainability efforts, workplace safety and wellbeing were 
continuously prioritised. A new Occupational Health, Safety 
and Environment (“OHSE”) officer was appointed to oversee 
compliance and sustainability efforts for the division. 
Please see page 40 for more information on the Trading and 
Manufacturing division’s Strategic Snapshot.
▶ Introduction of Dong Feng’s New Captain Series light-duty truck to the Malaysian market
FUTURE ORIENTATION
Going into FY 2024, manufacturers worldwide are expected to 
continue to face economic uncertainty along with skilled labour 
shortage, supply chain disruptions and product innovation 
challenges in meeting net-zero emissions goals. Technology is 
poised to play a significant role in supporting manufacturers 
through these challenges, with smart factory solutions eyed as 
key drivers of competitiveness over the next five years.
On a positive note, FY 2024 looks to be a stronger rebound year 
for the domestic manufacturing sector with predicted upswings 
in domestic and international trade, China’s manufacturing 
activities as well as the international technology sector. Overall, 
economic experts forecast a growth rate of at least 4% for the 
domestic manufacturing sector in 2024.
However, global supply chain disruptions, disintermediation 
and economic downturn remain ongoing risks. There is also a 
need to monitor the effects of regulatory changes such as the 
6% to 8% service tax hike, which may affect competitiveness. 
The Trading and Manufacturing division will continue to enforce 
regular monitoring and work closely with the other Sunway 
Group divisions for synergies, diversify suppliers and establish 
alternative supply chain routes, and explore streamlining its 
operations to optimise efficiency and reduce costs.
In addition, the division continues to work on the expansion of 
its network either by acquiring or establishing joint ventures with 
other companies or even to diversify into new business services. 
Improved warehouse efficiency is also a priority, with a capital 
expenditure budget of RM20 million allocated for the Automated 
Storage & Retrieval System at the new Winstar warehouse in 
Dengkil, Selangor, which is expected to be completed in 2025.
New Dongfeng EV and ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) models 
are in the works, with funding allocated to import more stocks 
from China to generate more sales.
On the technological front, the division is tapping into more 
digital initiatives to improve sales performance and enhance 
customers’ experience. Among these are the development of a 
mobile ordering application for a smoother sales process. The 
division is also looking into adoption of the e-invoicing systems 
for operational efficiencies.
With these plans in place, the Trading and Manufacturing division 
is well equipped to continue meeting the evolving product needs 
of the industry in FY 2024 and beyond. 
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
The Trading and Manufacturing division’s product diversification 
and sales-boosting measures proved to be a successful move as 
total sales for the year far exceeded the set target. 
CASE products have attained their peak performance levels 
since the acquisition of the CASE agency in 2015. Particularly 
noteworthy is the remarkable sales growth demonstrated by the 
CASE soil compactor, elevating its market leadership to the no. 
2 spot in the soil compactor market.
Successful introduction of Dongfeng’s Light Duty Trucks 
(“LDT”), featuring optimised payload capacity and efficiency, 
had a positive impact on overall sales for the year, despite 
experiencing a slight delay in its importation. Efforts to expand 
renewable energy products such as solar panels and inverters 
also helped to support the growth of the division’s revenue 
stream in FY 2023.
Notably, the division’s effort to convert consumers of diesel 
forklifts to lithium-ion forklifts paid off with close to 145 units 
being sold and rented during the year under review, which 
contributed to over RM10 million revenue.
Sunway Winstar saw an increase in its portfolio of blockbuster 
products, from 15 to 19, attributable to increased market 
demand, which also enabled the company to surpass its initial 
sales target for these products by 33%.
Beyond the commendable sales performance, the Trading and 
Manufacturing division also appointed a new OHSE officer 
to enhance OSHE compliance and sustainability efforts. As 
a result, the division achieved an “Excellent” score in OHSE 
compliance and “Platinum” in OHSE best practices for 2023.

QUARRY
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
In FY 2023, Sunway’s quarry division felt the impact of the 
country’s economic landscape, which played a pivotal role in 
driving demand for quarry products. The initiation of substantial 
infrastructure investments during this period stimulated industry 
growth, contributing to increased productivity and sales for the 
quarry division. However, the division encountered challenges 
due to sporadic road closures and operational restrictions during 
festive or holiday periods, necessitating temporary halts in quarry 
and premix operations. These disruptions posed challenges for 
maintaining consistent supply chains and affected the division’s 
performance during the stoppages.
Despite these challenges, the division demonstrated resilience as 
economic activities resumed after closures. The quarry division’s 
response to the dynamic conditions led to fluctuations in demand 
for products such as aggregates and premix. Navigating a balance 
between recurrent operational disruptions and increased demand, 
the division showcased adaptability in a landscape influenced 
by both positive infrastructure developments and occasional 
challenges stemming from operational restrictions.
The quarry division strategically navigated market dynamics through 
initiatives aimed at enhancing financial performance and overall 
value creation. Ongoing exploration activities in the Northern region 
highlight the division’s commitment to expanding its network, 
fortifying market competitiveness, and growing a diversified customer 
base. Simultaneously, collaborations with other ready-mix companies 
to establish new facilities within existing quarries aim to elevate sales 
capabilities and optimise operational costs, aligns with the division’s 
broader strategy to solidify market positioning and ensure sustainable 
revenue streams.
Concurrently, the division’s proactive steps, such as collaborating with 
sizeable readymix and precast companies and securing partnerships 
with bitumen suppliers, exemplified its commitment to diversifying 
product offerings and securing strategic projects. These initiatives 
position the division as a versatile and competitive player in the 
construction materials market, contributing to long-term growth and 
profitability while aligning with evolving market demands.
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
▶ A pneumatic tyred roller is used to compact asphalt road
In FY 2023, the quarry division has prioritised initiatives to address 
environmental concerns and promote responsible business practices 
in line with the Group’s sustainability ambitions. One significant stride 
was the implementation of drone technology at quarry sites, initiated in 
December 2023 and slated for completion by Q1 2024. The strategic 
deployment of drones for rockface surveillance and perimeter security 
not only contribute to operational efficiency, enhancing site safety but 
also help in reducing the division’s ecological footprint while offering 
a more precise understanding of operational landscapes.
Additionally, the quarry division further bolstered its commitment 
to Health, Safety and Environment with the introduction of the 
Hazard Spot & Report System (HSRS) across all operating sites in 
July 2023. This online platform empowers staff to report unsafe 
acts and conditions, fostering a culture of safety and environmental 
compliance. 
Furthermore, the division embraced technological advancements 
for increased operational efficiency by automating laboratory report 
preparation. System-generated mix design requests and automatic 
laboratory reports not only improved customer experience but also 
contributed to internal productivity gains, further underscoring the 
division’s dedication to sustainability and environmental stewardship.
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
In FY 2023, the quarry division experienced a remarkable 
upswing in revenue and profit before tax, surpassing the 
achievements of FY 2022. This can be attributed to a robust 
surge in demand and higher selling prices for aggregates 
and premix, particularly notable towards the second half 
of FY 2023 from the rollout of more construction and road 
maintenance projects. 
Beyond financial accomplishments, the quarry division was 
also recognised as a trailblazer in the Malaysian quarry 
industry for its dedication to environmental responsibility. 
Its Rawang and Hulu Langat sites recently received the 
Malaysian Government Energy Audit Conditional Grant 
(“EACG 2.0”). The EACG 2.0 grant is an energy efficiency 
programme under the 12th Malaysia plan which provides 
financial assistance to eligible commercial and industrial 
sectors to conduct energy audits in their sites. The grant 
will be a catalyst for the identification and implementation 
of a comprehensive 3-year energy improvement plan for the 
Rawang and Hulu Langat sites. 
By leveraging this grant to proactively address energy 
consumption and environmental impact, Sunway’s quarry 
division further solidifies its role as an industry leader, 
contributing to the sustainable development of Malaysia’s 
quarry sector. 
Looking ahead to the future of Malaysia’s aggregates and premix 
industry, the quarry division anticipates promising prospects 
in FY 2024. Budget 2024 unveiled several commitments to 
infrastructure projects such as allocation of a substantial RM4.7 
billion for the resumption of construction for five Light Rail 
Transit 3 (LRT3) stations and RM931 million for the expansion 
of the North-South Highway (PLUS) in Johor, this will augur 
well for the industry and the demand for aggregates and premix. 
The quarry division is strategically positioning itself to capitalise 
on the expected growth in the construction and infrastructure 
sectors and has outlined strategic goals to fortify its position in 
the industry. A key focus is on mergers and acquisitions, with a 
commitment to actively seek opportunities that will expand the 
division’s network in the Northern region. The division is also 
gearing up to strengthen its relationships with local authorities 
and encouraging robust partnerships to align its strategies with 
broader objectives of infrastructure development, securing 
projects, and enhancing its standing in the industry.
Simultaneously, the quarry division is committed to innovation 
in product development and strengthening its sustainability 
credentials. The division will persist in exploring avenues to 
enhance the special premix to ensure that the product meets 
the evolving requirements of high-value applications. Initiatives 
slated for the upcoming year include the installation of 
inverters for premix operations, which aligns with the division’s 
commitment to reducing electricity costs and promoting eco-
friendly practices.
Recognising the integral role of human capital in its success, 
the division will continue to invest in talent development. 
Collaborations with local universities and institutions is in the 
works with the aim to attract and retain skilled individuals to 
the division, ensuring a dynamic and proficient workforce that 
contributes to the division’s growth as it navigates the evolving 
landscape of the industry.
With these plans and priorities in place, the quarry division is 
well positioned to seize opportunities to drive the sustainable 
growth of the division in the dynamic aggregates and premix 
industry.

BUILDING MATERIALS
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
In FY 2023, the operating environment for the Building Materials 
division has been significantly influenced by a variety of factors, 
both positive and challenging. 
The relative stability of the domestic economic climate in 
particular has been a boon to the local construction industry, 
as the consistency of government policies and resulting market 
confidence in its direction to pursue and fund mega projects 
facilitated construction companies’ access to capital and tender 
book replenishment. This, in turn, has directly spurred the 
performance of the Building Materials division.
At the same time, however, the division continue to face 
headwinds from domestic and international factors which has 
slowed Malaysia’s economic recovery as well as disruptions in 
the global supply chain. This has resulted instability in costs 
of key materials such as gas, fuel, cement, steel, and other raw 
materials, impacting the division’s cost structure. 
Adding to the challenges, the current weak Malaysian Ringgit 
against most major currencies and the increase in cost of 
financing, with the Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) set by Bank 
Negara Malaysia (“BNM”) rising over 2022 and 2023 levels, 
lead to inflationary pressures.
STRATEGIC RESPONSE
In response to the rising costs of operations, the Building 
Materials division has adjusted its selling prices to mitigate the 
impact of supply chain disruptions and ensure the division’s 
consistent earnings performance. Concurrently, the division has 
also intensified credit control measures and rigorously assess 
customers’ creditworthiness to manage liquidity risks.
Aside from financial control measures, the division has placed 
a stronger focus on research and development (“R&D”) to boost 
process efficiency and product distinctiveness. This includes 
exploring the potential of adopting Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), 
the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and Machine Learning (“ML”) 
technologies to augment internal processes and expand the use 
of digital collaborative tools to enhance engagement with both 
staff and customers.
The division has also sought to deepen its engagement with 
government agencies, suppliers and customers, particularly on 
knowledge sharing about Building Materials division’s sustainable 
solutions. This is aimed to obtain early insights into evolving 
market trends and align swiftly with new government policies 
and directives, such as the Madani Economy, New Industrial 
Master Plan 2030 (“NIMP”), Malaysia Budget 2024 and the 
12th Malaysia Plan.
Beyond supporting national development goals, the division 
has also endeavoured to align its operations with the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UNSDG”), focusing 
on Clean Water and Sanitation, Affordable and Clean Energy, 
Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Sustainable Cities and 
Communities, and Responsible Consumption and Production. 
Initiatives in carbon reduction, waste management, R&D and 
process improvements were pursued to not only enhance the 
division’s brand reputation and market competitiveness, but also 
its environmental stewardship.
In addition to environmental and operational excellence, the 
Building Materials division places a high value on Human 
Capital. The division is committed to fostering teamwork, 
engagement, career development, training and talent retention 
at all levels. Safety at work remains a paramount concern, with 
the implementation of ISO 45001 and adherence to various 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) 
requirements and best practices prioritised at all times. These 
measures ensure that the working environment is both safe and 
conducive, underpinning the division’s holistic approach to 
sustainability, operational efficiency and employee well-being.
Please see page 42 for more information on the Building Materials 
division’s Strategic Snapshot.
HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
The Building Materials division’s efforts in pursuing innovation 
and R&D has yielded significant benefits, leading to reduced 
production costs, enhanced product differentiation and 
fortified brand positioning. 
Notably, the division has achieved cost reductions in spun 
pile production through the use of fly ash and enhanced the 
manufacturing efficiency of vitrified clay pipe (“VCP”) by 
optimising firing times and is expected to further improve 
production efficiency by reducing gas consumption, changes 
in using inverter motors to reduce the carbon footprint from 
the production process.
Furthermore, its pavers products were developed with an 
algae-resistant solution to minimise maintenance expenses 
and it is also a green product that boast high Solar Reflective 
Indexes. These innovative solutions and advantages have 
led to enhanced product differentiation and heightened 
product integrity, while the division’s adoption of solar energy 
harvesting further diminished its reliance on grid electricity. 
Marketing initiatives carried out in FY 2023 have also 
enhanced brand loyalty towards its Interlocking Concrete 
Pavers (“ICP”) and Eurotiles products, resulting in increased 
ICP sales conversions with various city councils and 
customers.
Collectively, these strategic endeavours have gone a long 
way to reinforce the Building Materials division’s image 
as a corporate leader in environmental responsibility that 
is attuned to market demands and aligned with national 
and global carbon reduction goals, bolstering its market 
competitiveness and improved margins.
Beyond product innovation and sales achievements, 
the Building Materials division has seen operational 
improvements through the deployment of digital collaborative 
tools and the Eliminate, Simplify, Standardise and Automate 
(ESSA) initiatives, leading to reduced reliance on manpower 
and enhanced process efficiency. 
The division also reported improved workplace safety and 
enhanced Occupational Health and Safety (OHSA) compliance 
over the past year, which facilitated the attainment of ISO 
45001 certification for Sunway Paving Solutions Sdn Bhd 
and Sunway Spun Pile (M) Sdn Bhd. 
The Building Materials division enters FY 2024 with cautious 
optimism, closely aligning its strategies with the recovery 
trajectory of Malaysia’s economy and staying abreast of new 
market trends. 
Despite the challenges posed by local and global economic 
uncertainties, the division anticipates an increase in federal 
and state government spending, which could provide significant 
opportunities for growth. Nevertheless, challenges are expected 
to persist in FY 2024 due to continued supply chain disruptions, 
raw material price volatility and the rising cost of financing, 
exacerbated by the increase in Sales & Service Tax (SST) from 
6% to 8% effective from 1 March 2024. 
The division is poised to adapt its strategy to navigate these 
complexities. Strategic measures to mitigate these risks include 
enhancing procurement management practices to counter supply 
chain disruptions and improving inventory management to 
safeguard profit margins against cost fluctuations. Strengthening 
cash flow management to minimise working capital requirements 
will also be a priority.
In FY 2024, the Building Materials division intends to intensify 
its growth through cost reduction initiatives, exploring alternative 
markets, and deploying AI, IoT and ML to lower product 
costs without compromising product integrity. Additionally, 
the division plans to increase product and brand awareness 
through participation in exhibitions and seeking new business 
partnerships to facilitate entry into overseas markets.
Continued engagement with suppliers, customers and authorities 
will remain a fundamental pillar to the Building Materials 
division’s growth strategy. This includes advocating for the 
acceptance of new product specifications and quality standards 
among government agencies for ICP, VCP and Spun Pile products 
and services. Parallel to these efforts, continuous research and 
development will be employed to enhance product quality, extend 
the product range, and increase production capacity to meet 
rising demands.
The division will also seek to leverage commercial and business 
synergies across Sunway’s diverse business divisions, utilising the 
strengths of these entities to derive further cost and operational 
efficiencies.

Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah Fook Ling (“Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey 
Cheah”) is the founder and Executive Chairman of Sunway, one 
of Southeast Asia’s leading conglomerates with 13 business 
divisions across more than 50 locations worldwide. He is also 
the founder and trustee of Jeffrey Cheah Foundation (“JCF”), 
the largest of its kind advancing education in Malaysia through 
a social enterprise model. 
An ardent advocate of the sustainable development agenda, 
accompanied by a deep commitment to giving back to society, 
his entrepreneurial and philanthropic activities showcase his 
personal philosophy:  that “one must have a higher purpose in 
life” and that “sustainability and profitability can go hand in 
hand”.
The very founding of Sunway Group is based on the concept 
of sustainable development. The flagship Sunway City Kuala 
Lumpur was transformed from 800 acres of tin-mining wasteland 
into Malaysia’s first integrated, green township. It is now home 
to a vibrant community of more than 200,000 people living, 
working, learning and playing in a healthy, safe and connected 
environment.
Canopied walkways and electric buses running on specially 
designed elevated lanes provide seamless connectivity between 
its various facilities, which include residences, commercial 
entities, hotels, three universities, Malaysia’s first theme park, a 
1,100-bed medical centre and one of Malaysia’s largest malls.
 
By integrating technology even more deeply in its operations, 
Sunway City Kuala Lumpur aims to become the region’s model 
smart, sustainable city of the 21st  century. 
Sunway City Ipoh was built upon the principles of preservation 
and conservation, cradled by 260-million-year-old limestone 
hills, rainforests and flowing thermal hotsprings. Sunway City 
Iskandar Puteri in Johor, dubbed as Nature’s Capital City, offers 
world-class city living in harmony with the area’s natural beauty, 
such as the seafront facing Singapore across the Johor Straits, 
the Pendas River and mangrove forests. 
Sunway’s unique “Build-Own-Operate” model ensures constant 
value creation and the continued growth of its properties.
The success of Sunway City Kuala Lumpur propelled Sunway 
Group’s growth beyond property development into one of 
Southeast Asia’s leading conglomerates, comprising 13 business 
divisions, a 16,000*-strong workforce and operations in 50 
locations worldwide.
Firmly and consistently upholding the core values of Integrity, 
Humility and Excellence, Sunway, under Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey 
Cheah’s visionary leadership, supported by a highly competent 
and capable management team, has established a reputation as 
a trusted brand with an excellent track record for delivering on 
its promises.
In line with Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah’s pioneering commitment 
to sustainability, Sunway embraced the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals, or SDGs, adopted by the United Nations 
in 2015 and has integrated sustainability into all of the Group’s 
business practices and decision-making processes.
Sunway is demonstrating daily that sustainability and profitability 
can go hand in hand.
Driven by his personal motto of “I aspire to inspire before I 
expire”, it is Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah’s hope that by walking 
the talk, Sunway can set an example for other corporations to 
follow. It is his firm belief that given the state of the planet and 
its people, implementing the sustainable development agenda is 
no longer just an option but an urgent imperative and that “we 
can all do well by doing good”.
Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah’s business success enabled him to 
realise his lifelong dream of setting up a Foundation dedicated 
to nation-building and giving back to society.
Rooted in his conviction that education offers the best route out 
of poverty and misery, he established the JCF in 2010 by gifting 
it, in perpetuity, his entire stake in the Sunway Education Group 
(“SEG”). The gift was worth several billion ringgit.
The not-for-profit Foundation owns and governs all educational 
entities under the SEG. It is helmed by an independent and 
distinguished Board of Trustees under the royal patronage of His 
Royal Highness the Sultan of Selangor.
Committed to nation-building by making quality education and 
world-class expertise affordable and accessible, the Foundation 
has disbursed scholarships and grants exceeding RM670 million 
to date. It is Tan Sri Sir Dr. Jeffrey Cheah’s personal aim to 
award several billion worth of scholarships in his lifetime.
The Foundation has also established partnerships with Sunway 
and a string of world-renowned institutions that include 
University of Cambridge, Harvard University, University of 
Oxford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, 
University of California, Berkeley, and Lancaster University in 
the United Kingdom.
Following a gift that will eventually total USD20 million over 
10 years, the Foundation entered into a partnership with the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS A
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Directors are obligated to steer clear of situations 
that might pose a direct or indirect conflict with 
the interests of the Group, whether perceived or 
real. They must not allow personal or business 
interests to impede their duties. In adherence to 
this policy, the Board has instituted a clear and 
transparent guideline that prohibits a Director 
from participating in the deliberation and voting 
process when a conflict/potential conflict of 
interest arises/may arise.
Before each significant Board decision, the 
Chairman ensures that the Directors confirm the 
absence of any personal conflict concerning the 
matter under discussion. In cases where a conflict 
is identified, the concerned Director is excused 
from the discussion, and their declaration of 
interest is duly recorded in the meeting minutes. 
INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Board upholds a formalised Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics Policy (“Code”) to provide 
an ethical framework guiding the actions and 
behaviours of Directors and employees. This Code 
reflects the Company’s dedication to maintaining 
the highest standards of integrity and ethical 
conduct across all operations. In addition, 
the Company has instituted a comprehensive 
Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures, allowing 
employees and stakeholders to promptly report 
suspected wrongdoing, inappropriate behaviour, 
or misconduct related to fraud, corrupt practices, 
or abuse.
The objective of this policy and procedure is 
to establish a mechanism for employees and 
stakeholders of the Group to report concerns 
without fear of retaliation, enabling Management 
to take appropriate action. To facilitate the 
disclosure of any improper conduct, employees or 
members of the public can report such behaviour 
through the designated channels outlined in 
the policy. The Company values all disclosures 
and ensures that they are handled with utmost 
confidentiality and sensitivity.
GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK AND BOARD RESOURCES
Ensuring strong corporate governance is vital for responsibly 
managing our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. To 
achieve this, we have established a governance framework 
that defines clear lines of accountability and responsibility, 
facilitating seamless information sharing, swift decision-making, 
and focused oversight. Adhering to this framework allows us to 
maintain transparency, align our actions with our values, and be 
accountable to our stakeholders.
Our governance systems and processes support the development 
and execution of our strategy by ensuring accountability and 
responsibility, facilitating information sharing for informed 
Board decisions, establishing engagement programs with key 
stakeholders, maintaining a strong system of risk oversight, 
management, and effective internal controls, providing 
independent insight and knowledge from Non-Executive 
Directors, and facilitating the development and monitoring of 
key performance indicators.
The Board adheres to a comprehensive schedule that exclusively 
reserves certain matters for its approval, as outlined in the 
Board Charter, available on our website. The Board Charter 
and the Committees’  terms of reference are regularly reviewed 
and revised to ensure their effectiveness and compliance with 
regulators’ requirements. To enhance the flow of information, 
Directors utilise an advanced electronic Board paper system, 
ensuring immediate and secure access to crucial documents. The 
Chairman and committee chairs collaborate with the Company 
Secretaries to set agendas, ensuring timely, comprehensive, and 
manageable information for the Board’s deliberations.
All papers presented adhere to a clear and concise format, with 
supporting materials included as appendices. In some instances, 
report presenters join Board discussions, enabling Directors 
to pose questions directly and gain a deeper understanding 
of the subject matters. Additionally, Directors have access to 
the Company Secretaries’ services and may initiate procedures 
to obtain independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense, as necessary.
BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
BOARD KEY FOCUS AREAS AND FUTURE PRIORITIES
The Executive Chairman provides leadership to the Board and guidance to the Group.
The Independent Non-Executive Co-Chairman chairs the Board meetings, sets the agenda items, promote 
active engagement among Directors as well as between the Board and the President. He ensures the smooth 
functioning of the Board including the effectiveness of the overall governance systems and processes. 
Co-Chairmen 
The President reports to the Executive Chairman and the Board. He focuses on the Group’s businesses and 
manages the day-to-day operations of the Company as well as implements the Board’s decisions.
President 
Dr. Philip Yeo Liat Kok is the appointed Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. He coordinates the 
activities of the Independent Non-Executive Directors in circumstances where it would be inappropriate for the 
Chairman to serve in such capacity. He is available to shareholders if they have concerns relating to matters 
that the Chairman, President or Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) has failed to resolve, or where such contact is 
inappropriate.
Senior Independent 
Non-Executive

financial controls and systems of risk management are robust.
Non-Executive

agendas and collate and distribute papers, ensure compliance with Board procedures and advise on

Secretaries
Board Renewal
During the year under review, the Board had appointed Datuk Mohd Anuar 
bin Taib as an Independent Director on 7 July 2023. Tan Sri Jamaludin bin 
Ibrahim had resigned as an Independent Director on 3 March 2024. The 
changes in the Board members will refresh and enhance the appropriate 
balance of experience, expertise and diversity of the Board. 
Compliance Framework of the Group
In a continuous effort to improve the Group’s risk management, the 
Group had, with the assistance of KPMG Management & Risk Consulting 
Sdn Bhd, established and adopted a compliance and risk management 
framework to manage the risks across the Group. 
Executive Directors and Management’s Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) 
The Company has integrated sustainability and carbon pricing into the 
Executive Directors’ and Senior Management’s performance evaluations 
and KPIs that are linked to their remuneration. The KPIs are aligned to 
the Sunway Sustainability 2030 Goals and Targets. 
Management Advisory Committee on Digital
As part of the Group’s digital transformation initiatives, the Management 
Advisory Committee will explore and advise the Board on digital initiatives 
and new digital businesses.
Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050
The Group continues with its initiatives to achieve the “Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050” goal.
The Group has appointed The Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable 
Development (“JSC”) to conduct a Value at Risk (“VaR ”) assessment on all 
its 74 properties to assess the Group’s physical risk exposure to climate 
change. Based on the climate VaR study, Sunway will continue to monitor 
all properties closely to ensure that they are safe against material climate-
related physical risks (floods, increased rainfall intensity, landslides) 
and put in place mitigation measures as appropriate. To prepare for the 
potential transitional risks from climate-related issues, the Group has 
established an Internal Carbon Pricing framework and set an internal 
carbon price at RM15 per tonne of CO2e emitted above a threshold 
level based on the respective business divisions. Management has also 
included the respective CO2e threshold level set as a key performance 
indicator of the business divisions and any breach of the carbon emission 
threshold will have an impact on their respective year-end bonus pool. 
In 2023, the Group had introduced incentives under its Internal Carbon 
Pricing framework for renewable energy and waste diversion as well as 
appointed the JSC to enhance the VaR assessment through conducting a 
refreshed flood risk modelling for the Group’s properties and quantify the 
financial impacts of climate change.
Sunway is committed to deepening our understanding of the climate-
related potential risks and opportunities, and investing in strategies 
and actions that will prudently mitigate material risks and enhance our 
business position as a provider of high-quality green and sustainable 
products and services.

Board, fostering a culture of openness and 
transparency that we deem crucial to our 
success in a rapidly changing business 
landscape.
Professional Training
A robust and agile Board plays a pivotal role in the success of our organisation. 
At Sunway, we prioritise the composition of our Board, ensuring it consists of 
a diverse and highly skilled team capable of steering the Group towards long-
term growth and prosperity.
Operating in a continuously evolving landscape, it is imperative that our 
Executive and Independent Directors possess the knowledge and skills 
necessary to navigate forthcoming challenges and opportunities. We are 
dedicated to keeping our Directors well-informed on the latest developments, 
trends, and best practices in corporate governance, regulatory compliance, 
and other relevant areas.
To fulfill this commitment, we have implemented various initiatives, including 
regular training sessions, knowledge-sharing forums, and briefings from 
subject matter experts. Our Company Secretaries play a vital role in keeping 
the Board abreast of any regulatory or legislative changes that may impact our 
operations. Additionally, our NRC ensures that the Board maintains the right 
mix of skills and experience to drive the Group’s long-term success.

(“NRC”) REPORT
Composition of the NRC
The NRC comprises exclusively Independent Non-

under review, the Chairperson of the NRC was 
Tan Sri Datuk Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria. The 
other members of the Committee were Dr. Philip 
Yeo Liat Kok (“Dr. Philip Yeo”),  Tan Sri Jamaludin 
bin Ibrahim (“Tan Sri Jamaludin”) and Datuk Mohd 
Anuar bin Taib (“Datuk Anuar”). Tan Sri Dato’ 
Dr. Lin See Yan (“Tan Sri Lin”) ceased to be a 
member of NRC upon retiring as a Director at the 
Thirteenth Annual General Meeting (“13th AGM”) 
of the Company held on 22 June 2023. Tan Sri 
Jamaludin had subsequently resigned as a member 
of NRC on 3 March 2024 when he tendered his 
resignation as a Director on even date.
The NRC is responsible for, amongst other roles, 
reviewing the composition, size and diversity of 
the Board. It ensures that the Board comprises 
Directors who are fit and proper with appropriate 
skills, knowledge, expertise and experience as well 
as ensuring a proper balance between Executive 
Directors and Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. It is also responsible for advising the 
Board on matters relating to the remuneration of 
the Board and Senior Management. In 2023, it 
took on the additional responsibility of monitoring 
the overall organisational health of the Group. 
  
It regularly reviews the criteria to be used in 
the Board recruitment process. For candidates 
proposed for appointment as Independent Non-
Executive Directors, the NRC assesses the 
candidate’s independence in accordance with 
Paragraph 1.01 and Practice Note 13 of the Main 
Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa 
Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”), 
his/her time commitment, potential contribution 
as well as meeting the criteria of the Board’s 
Fit and Proper Policy. For the year under review,

suitable by the NRC based on criteria set by the 
Board.

At its Meeting held on 23 February 2023, the NRC:

against planned key performance indicators (“KPIs”). Areas of 
assessment covered financial objectives, strategic initiatives and 
business growth, organisational effectiveness, sustainability and 
environment, social and governance (“ESG”) objectives as well as 
initiatives.
• Based on their performance ratings and the bonus framework, the 
NRC then determined and endorsed the salary increments and 
bonuses of the Executive Directors. The compensation and rewards

skills gap. The NRC was satisfied that the Board has the required skills 
sets, experience and knowledge to govern the Group effectively and 
chart its future strategic direction for sustainable long-term growth.

deliberations by providing counter-arguments, suggestions and ideas.

ABOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

• Reviewed and amended its TOR to align it with recent 
changes to the regulatory requirements and the updated 
Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance.
• Reviewed and updated on the key C-Suite and Level 2 
Leaders’ succession plan. The Group Human Resources 
Officer presented in detail the potential successors 
to each key position in the organisation. The NRC 
received assurances that all potential candidates were 
experienced and of high calibre. The potential candidates’ 
readiness was closely tracked through a structured and 
systematic leadership program in order to provide orderly 
management succession. All Senior Management have 
one or more potential successors in one or more of these 
stages of readiness i.e., ready now, ready soon or ready 
later. 
 In managing talents and succession planning, annual 
talent reviews were conducted across the Group, 
culminating in the review of key management positions 
The assessment criteria and outcome are summarised as follows:
Evaluation Assessment Criteria 
Board Evaluation Board mix, composition and development, Board dynamic and effectiveness, conduct of 
board meetings, roles and responsibilities, company performance, performance of Chairman, 
performance of President, Board sustainability matters.
Board Committee Evaluation Committee composition, quality, skills and competencies, roles and responsibilities, effective 
communication, qualification of chairperson.
Director’s Peer Evaluation Director’s fit and proper criteria, contribution and performance, individual competencies and 
personality, understanding of roles. 
Independent Directors’ 
Self-Assessment
The criteria set under paragraph 1.01 of the MMLR of Bursa Securities.
TENURE OF DIRECTORSHIP
The Board has a policy whereby an Independent Non-Executive Director who has reached the threshold of 9 years’ tenure will be  
re-designated as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director. 
During the financial year under review, none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors reached the 9-year tenure.
OUTCOME 
The Directors concluded that the Board was effective in its governance and strategic roles and had fulfilled its statutory responsibilities 
efficiently. The Director’s peer review affirmed that each Director had performed their respective role and responsibilities effectively. 
Each member was satisfied with each other’s contribution in sharing their insights, ideas and suggestions. They were involved 
in active participation in Board and Board Committees’ deliberations and discussions. The Chairman of the Board was effective 
in managing the board agenda as well as ensuring open and free discussions. Hence, there was no risk of “group think” as each 
Director had the freedom to express his/her own views. All the Board Committees were assessed to be effective in discharging their 
roles and responsibilities in accordance to the approved TORs.
Majority of the Board members had shown their time commitment by attending all the meetings scheduled. Directors who were not 
able to attend due to urgent unforeseen circumstances were kept abreast of the matters discussed. The Board planned to engage 
independent experts to facilitate its annual assessment every three (3) years.
ANNUAL BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEES EVALUATION
The NRC undertakes an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and each Director’s performance 
by way of self and peer evaluation. This includes a review of the desirable mix of competencies, qualification, knowledge, skills, 
expertise and personal traits of the Directors in order to identify any gaps that may exist in the optimum mix of skills required for the 
Board. In addition, Directors were subject to fit and proper assessment to ensure each individual Director has the necessary integrity 
and honesty to govern the Company.
Since the Board had engaged an independent consultant to conduct the Board & Directors Effectiveness Evaluation exercise for the 
financial year 2021, the evaluation process for year 2023 was assessed internally and facilitated by the Company Secretaries. As 
part of the process, survey questionnaires were sent to the Directors, and the results were aggregated and reported to the NRC. All 
assessments carried out by the NRC were properly documented, summarised and reported to the Board. The results of the survey 
and recommendations of the NRC were discussed by the Board and follow-up improvements were taken, where necessary, with a 
view to enhancing its effectiveness.
by the Talent Council, led by the President. This annual 
exercise comprehensively reviews the succession 
plans for all key management positions, including the 
leadership and growth potential, and development plans 
for the identified successors. These key management 
profiles were reviewed with the Group Chairman prior to 
the Group Human Resources Officer’s presentation to the 
NRC for endorsement, on 22 November 2023.
• Reviewed and discussed the performance appraisal of 
the Executive Directors and Key Senior Management for 
2023 (i.e. actual results for first 9 months and forecasted 
results for the balance 3 months). The review was for 
the purpose of determining the payment of interim 
bonuses. The results achieved were measured against its 
budgets.  Based on the performance scorecard, the NRC 
recommended the interim bonuses and salary increment 
for the Executive Directors for approval of the Board.  
• Reviewed and recommended for the Board’s approval, 
the renewal of contract of service for Tan Sri Chew for the 
period from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024. 
BOARD EVALUATION
The Board Chairman, in collaboration with the NRC, is entrusted with the responsibility of cultivating a proficient Board characterised 
by a well-rounded spectrum of skills, expertise and experience. An annual performance evaluation is systematically conducted to 
gauge the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. This evaluation ensures that each Director demonstrates a dedicated 
commitment to his/her responsibilities and possesses the necessary time and competence to fulfill his/her duties effectively.
REMUNERATION
The Group acknowledges the importance of offering a fair and competitive remuneration package to attract and retain Executive 
Directors and Senior Management. This package is designed to align with their qualifications, experience, skills, responsibilities, 
performance and contributions as well as benchmark with industry peers. To determine this remuneration, the Group considers the 
framework and guidelines provided by an independent consultant, incorporating market data on remuneration practices among 
comparable peers in the industry. The structure is based on linking rewards to both corporate and individual performance. The 
performance and remuneration package of the Executive Directors are subject to the evaluation of the NRC.
For Independent Non-Executive Directors, including the Non-Executive Chairman, their remuneration reflects their knowledge, 
experience and level of responsibilities. Additionally, it is benchmarked against industry peers of similar size and complexity with 
the Group’s businesses. The remuneration for Independent Non-Executive Directors comprises fixed annual Directors’ fees, Board 
Committees’ fees, and meeting allowances for each Board or Board Committee meeting attended.
The determination of fees for the Non-Executive Directors is undertaken by the Board, with individual Directors abstaining from 
decisions regarding their individual remuneration. Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company approve 
the fees and allowances payable to Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Chairman receives an annual Directors’ fee of 
RM360,000, while other Non-Executive Directors are entitled to RM120,000 per individual per year. Meeting allowances are set at 
RM1,000 per individual per meeting. 
In addition to the Directors’ fees, the Chairperson and members of the following Board Committees are entitled to the following

arises. The Board Committees’ fees are payable annually together with the payment of the Directors’ fees.

EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY B
 The AC scrutinised and reviewed the quarterly financial 
results with Management to ensure the appropriateness 
of the accounting treatment and the accuracy of the 
reported figures. The CFO highlighted the material 
transactions, accounting adjustments and provisions 
made. Explanations to material variances or movements 
during the relevant quarters were highlighted and 
explained. 
 Having reviewed the unaudited quarterly financial 
results, the AC subsequently recommended the same be 
presented to the Board for approval for release to Bursa 
Securities.
(b) Accounting standards and other relevant regulatory 
requirements
 The AC was also briefed by the CFO on the new 
Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRSs”) 
and amendments to MFRSs which came into effect on  
1 January 2023 as well as their impact on the Group: 
i)  MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts; 
ii)  Amendments to MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts;
iii)  Amendments to MFRS 112 Deferred Tax related 
to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single 
Transaction; 
iv)  Amendments to MFRS 101 Disclosures of Accounting 
Policies; and 
v)  Amendments to MFRS 108 Definition of Accounting 
Estimates. 
       
(c)  Response to Key Audit Matters 
 The preparation of financial statements in conforming 
to MFRS and IFRS Accounting Standards required 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions. Key audit matters were matters of most 
significance in the audit of the financial statements of 
the Group and the Company. The AC had reviewed the 
process and procedures performed and was satisfied 
that the accounting estimates and significant judgement 
applied were appropriate. For the financial year under 
review, the External Auditors had identified the following 
as key audit matters:-
i)  Revenue recognition for property development
 Revenue from sale of properties under development 
is recognised over the period of contracts with 
customers using the input method by reference to 
the costs incurred for work performed to-date against 
the estimated costs to completion. Management 
is required to exercise significant judgements 
in determining the satisfaction of performance 
obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, 
transaction price allocation and costs in applying the 
input method to recognise revenue over time.
 During the review of quarterly management accounts 
and quarterly financial results to be released to Bursa 
Securities, the AC reviewed and discussed with 
Management, the basis used for the recognition of 
revenue from the sale of properties under development 
for all its significant property development activities 
both local and overseas projects. At each meeting, 
the CFO highlighted the areas where significant 
estimates and critical judgements were made in 
ascertaining the quantum and timing of revenue 
recognised. 
ii)  Revenue recognition for construction contracts
 Revenue from construction contracts is recognised 
over the period of contracts with customers using 
the output method which recognises revenue on the 
basis of certification of contract work performed to-
date over the estimated total contract sum.
 Management is required to exercise significant 
judgements in estimating the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations 
and determining whether there is any exposure to 
Liquidated Ascertained Damages (“LAD”) based 
on the facts and circumstances of the relevant 
construction projects, including projects that had 
been served with certificates of non-achievement for 
project delays, if any.
 During the review of quarterly management accounts 
and quarterly financial results to be released to Bursa 
Securities, the AC reviewed and discussed with 
Management, the basis used for the recognition of 
revenue for construction contracts under Sunway 
Construction Group Berhad. Management continued 
to closely monitor relevant indicators including 
potential exposures to project delays and LADs, 
supply chain disruption and labour shortage which 
would influence the estimates used in arriving at 
the Group’s reported revenue from construction 
contracts. At each quarterly meeting, the CFO had 
highlighted areas where there were potential LADs 
and areas where significant estimates and critical 
judgements were made in ascertaining contract sums 
including variation orders, claims or contingencies. 
iii)  Valuation of derivative liabilities on exit clauses 
in relation to the partial divestment of Sunway 
Healthcare Holdings Sdn Bhd (“SHH”) and its 
subsidiaries (“SHH Group”)
 Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the 
partial divestment of SHH Group represent the exit 
clauses attached to the Shareholders’ Agreement and 
Share Subscription Agreement entered between the 
Company, Sunway City Sdn Bhd (“SunCity”), SHH and 
Greenwood Capital Pte Ltd (“Greenwood”) following the 
divestment of 16% equity interest in SHH to Greenwood 
by SunCity. Management is required to exercise 
significant judgements in determining the fair values of 
the derivative liabilities on the exit clauses and is subject 
to estimation uncertainty as subjective variables need to 
be used by Management in order to derive the fair values. 
 During the review of quarterly management accounts 
and quarterly financial results to be released to Bursa 
Securities, the AC reviewed and discussed with 
Management, the basis used for the determination of the 
fair values of the derivative liabilities on the exit clauses. 
At each meeting, the CFO highlighted the significant 
estimates and critical judgements made in ascertaining 
the fair values of the derivative liabilities.
(d) Audited Financial Statements
 On 10 April 2023, the AC together with the External 
Auditors and Management, deliberated on the audited 
financial statements for the financial year ended  
31 December 2022. The AC was briefed on the audit 
status and significant changes to audit plans, significant 
related party transactions, key audit matters and summary 
of misstatements. The total effect of the uncorrected 
adjustments made against the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group was deemed immaterial.
   
 The Management and the External Auditors confirmed 
to the AC that the draft audited financial statements 
were prepared in accordance with the relevant 
accounting standards and legal requirements. On the 
recommendation of the AC, the Board subsequently 
approved the release of the audited financial statements 
to Bursa Securities.  
2. Assessing Risks and Control Environment
(a)  The AC also reviewed with the GIAD, the adequacy and 
robustness of the internal controls system and the risk 
management framework.  
(b)  On 22 February 2023, the AC was briefed by the 
External Auditors on its review on the Group’s IT system 
consequent to their financial audit. At the Meeting, the 
External Auditors reported that there were no significant 
weaknesses in the Group’s overall internal control 
systems.
3. Evaluating the Internal and External Audit Process
(a)  Internal Audit
i) The AC had approved GIAD’s 2023 Annual Audit Plan 
(“Audit Plan”) at the Meeting held on 22 February 
2023. The Audit Plan was developed using a risk-
based audit methodology whereby business units 
and processes were selected for audit based on risk 
assessments carried out periodically by GIAD. The 
AC had reviewed the adequacy and relevance of the 
scope and resources allocated for the Audit Plan. The 
Audit Plan and its proposed audit timetable and the 
budgeted man-hours were subsequently approved. 
The Audit Plan was also reviewed on a quarterly basis 
taking into account any new business and regulatory 
developments which had an impact on the audit 
coverage. 
 GIAD had provided reasonable assurance to the Board 
and Management on the adequacy and integrity of 
the internal controls, risk management, governance 
processes and management information systems of 
the Group, including systems for compliance with 
applicable laws, regulations, rules, directives and 
guidelines which were consistent with the Audit 
Charter of GIAD and best practices.
 GIAD’s audit engagements for 2023 were mainly 
carried out to cover the following key areas and

The Board affirms its commitment and responsibility towards effective risk management and internal control. The Board embeds risk 
management and internal control framework and systems into the activities, initiatives and processes of Sunway and its subsidiaries 
(“the Group”). The framework has been approved by the Board to identify, evaluate, mitigate, and monitor key risks faced by the 
Group. 
The framework is designed to mitigate risks or events with significant adverse impact on the achievement of the Group’s objectives 
and strategies. As such, it provides reasonable, but not absolute assurance, against material financial misstatements, management

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
2. Audit
3. Risk Management
The Group Internal Audit Department (“GIAD”) carries out 
internal audits on divisions and operating units of the Group 
based on a risk-based audit plan approved annually by the 
AC. Quarterly reports are submitted to the AC highlighting 
observations, recommendations, and action plans to improve the 
Group’s internal control system. The AC reviews and deliberates 
on any matters relating to internal control highlighted by the 
External Auditors in the course of their statutory audit of the 
financial statements of the Group. Additionally, subsidiaries 
accredited with certifications are audited by auditors of relevant 
certification bodies. Results of these audits are reported to 
management.
The Group’s risk management framework is benchmarked 
against the ISO31000:2018 Risk Management–Guidelines, 
and is designed to embed Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 
into key activities, initiatives and processes of the Group. 
Operating subsidiaries are tasked with reporting major risks on a 
quarterly basis to management as it aims for a holistic approach 
towards risk management. The respective operating subsidiaries 
being risk owners of their immediate sphere are responsible to 
develop the appropriate actions and strategies to mitigate risks. 
In providing assurance to the RMC and the Board, the Group 
Risk and Compliance Department (“GRC”), continues to review 
the quarterly risk reports to assist in identifying and mitigating 
all major risks of the operating subsidiaries in the Group. 
The quarterly risk reports from all operating subsidiaries are 
consolidated and reported to the RMC, highlighting major risks 
and mitigating controls carried out. 
1. Policies and Procedures
The Group’s internal control system includes formalised and 
documented internal policies, standards and procedures to 
ensure compliance with internal controls and relevant laws and 
regulations. It provides guidance to all divisions and operating 
subsidiaries to operate effectively and efficiently and respond 
proactively to potential business, operational, financial, 
compliance and other risks in achieving the Group’s goals and 
objectives. These documents are published in the Group’s web 
portals.

Components of the Internal Control System
The RMC meets quarterly to deliberate on top risks identified, and 
the Chairperson subsequently updates the Board on proceedings 
from the RMC. Internal control and risk related matters are 
recommended to the Board for deliberation or approval, while 
matters and decisions made within the purview of the RMC are 
escalated to the Board for notation. 
The GRC is accountable for effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and is independent of the risk owners. The risks owners 
i.e., the respective heads of operating subsidiaries have insights 
of respective businesses and are able to actively identify, mitigate 
and monitor the identified risks through decisions and actions.
Consequently, the GRC undertakes the role of assisting operating 
subsidiaries by identifying, quantifying, managing and mitigating 
critical risks, in addition to monitoring and reporting action plans 
prepared by the operating subsidiaries. In line with the Group’s 
governance process, the GRC also collaborates with other support 
functions such as Group Brand Marketing & Communication, 
Group Finance, Group Internal Audit, Group IT, Group Legal, 
Group Procurement, Group Secretarial and Group Sustainability. 
In 2022 the RMC and the Board had recommended the 
appointment of KPMG Management & Risk Consulting Sdn Bhd, 
to establish the Group Compliance Framework with an aim to 
review the Group’s compliance towards all applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements, internal policies, operational guidelines 
and procedures. 
This was followed by KPMG’s maturity assessment and gap 
analysis in 2023 to identify the resource requirement, industry 
benchmarks and an application roadmap. Improvement 
opportunities were identified towards key components of the 
Group’s existing compliance functions such as governance, 
culture, policies and procedures, compliance processes, people 
and skills and training. This roadmap was endorsed by the Board 
in August 2023 and its application is in progress.

The external risks to the Group are competition, disruption 
to the supply chain, inflation, interest rate and foreign 
exchange. 
The disruption to global trade and supply chain brought 
by the US-China trade tension and geopolitical conflicts in 
Europe and Middle East resulted in increase in fuel prices 
and building material, increasing costs of doing business. 
In mitigating this risk, the Group took measures such as 
reviewing its supply chain, adding alternative suppliers, 
improving its efficiency in doing business and enhancing 
synergies within the Group.
Inflationary pressures impacted the disposable incomes 
and spending patterns of consumers. The Group, especially 
property development, leisure and hospitality, addresses 
this risk through targeted and value adding offerings and 
products that meet the requirements of customers.
The change in weather patterns that led to increased 
rainfall, less-predictable dry/wet season, flooding and 
soil movements present risks to the Group’s assets, 
property development and construction businesses. The 
Group continues to mitigate these through enhanced risk 
management framework in areas such as site selection, 
civil, structural and architectural designs and maintenance 
management philosophy.
Synergistically, the Group stand to gain via competitive 
costs and pricing while offering bespoke, enhanced quality, 
value added and sustainable products and services. The 
Group remains committed to enhance its position as a 
model corporation in sustainable development, as seen by 
the transformation of its three integrated townships into 
low carbon sustainable cities.
External Risks
The Group continues to focus on attracting, developing 
and retaining talent as part of its succession planning 
and strengthening of the leadership pipeline. Emphasis is 
placed to promote and provide learning and development 
opportunities, to further improve the Group’s talent 
management structure and for the employees to achieve 
their full potential.  
In 2023, the Group’s efforts in mitigating human capital 
risks include the creation of pipelines with technical schools 
and community colleges to counter the shortage of frontline 
and skilled workers. Human Resource systems were updated 
and enhanced with process automation to encourage self 
service to increase productivity and upskilling on digital 
capabilities. 
Occupational Health, Safety and Environment (“OSHE”) 
remains an integral part of the Group’s operational values. 
The Group’s OHSE Policy was first announced in 2021, 
which set a roadmap to drive OHSE-related dialogues and 
efforts across the Group. Guided by the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act 1994, the policy outlines the roles and 
responsibilities of every staff across all levels, as well as to 
establish international best practices as the foundation of 
Sunway’s safety culture. 
In place is a robust process in identifying and mitigating 
operational safety risks. Accident statistics, site inspection 
reports, and employee feedback are used to conduct hazard 
identification. The risk assessment and risk control reports 
highlight work-related hazards which may cause high-
consequence injuries.
The Group OHSE Council, chaired by Sunway Group 
President undertakes and oversees the development of 
the OHSE framework, including the setting of the OHSE 
direction, objectives, targets and guidelines and procedures. 
The Council meets once every 3 months to address OHSE 
matters at Group and business division levels.
People Risks
The Group’s borrowings and foreign exchange exposures are 
updated to the RMC on a quarterly basis. For the financial 
year under review, the loan covenants are within the set 
requirements, while interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
are mitigated.
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from interest 
bearing borrowings. The Group manages its interest rate 
exposure by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate 
borrowings. The Group also entered into interest rate swap 
contracts and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the 
floating rate interest payable on certain borrowings. The 
Group closely monitors the interest rate and foreign exchange 
movements arising from the respective interest rate benchmark 
reforms in various jurisdictions. For the period under review, 
the Group’s interest rate swap contracts and cross currency 
swap contracts are not materially affected by any interest rate 
benchmark reforms.  
The Group is not significantly exposed to foreign currency 
risks as the majority of the Group’s transactions, assets and 
liabilities are denominated in Ringgit Malaysia except for 
foreign currency risk arising from certain foreign subsidiaries’ 
operations. These include the Singapore Dollar, United States 
Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Australian Dollar, British Pound 
Sterling and Indian Rupee. Foreign currency exposures in 
transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the 
operating entities are kept to an acceptable level. Wherever 
possible, the Group applies a natural hedge, by borrowing in 
the currency of the country in which the property or investment 
is located or by borrowing in currencies that match the revenue 
stream to be generated from its investments.
Material foreign currency transaction exposures are hedged, 
primarily with derivative financial instruments such as forward 
foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts. 
Cross currency swap contracts are entered to manage 
foreign currency risk exposures arising from foreign currency 
borrowings and minimise interest costs.
Financial Risks
The Group remains committed in mitigating risks of non-
compliance to all applicable rules or regulations which its 
business units or joint ventures are subjected to, such as, inter-
alia, anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering and 
anti-terrorism financing, competition, personal data protection, 
economic sanctions and environmental and health and safety 
laws. Impact from new laws and regulations or updates to 
existing laws and regulations are assessed to ensure compliance 
under normal operative conditions. Policies and procedures 
which form part of the Internal Control System are periodically 
reviewed to ensure relevance, applicability and to reduce the 
Group’s exposure to potential legal liabilities and minimise any 
adverse impact arising from non-compliance.
Regulatory Risks
For the financial year under review, the following risks were most prevalent among business units in the Group. These were presented 
to the RMC where controls, mitigating plans and monitoring mechanisms were highlighted.
Key Risk Factors Key Risk Factors
STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group adopted a multi directional effort in establishing 
policies and roadmaps to mitigate value chain risks such as 
potential supply chain disruptions, use of non-sustainable 
materials which could impact the Group’s drive in sustainable 
practices and non-compliance of suppliers and vendors against 
the Group’s practices or policies. The Group’s Sustainability 
Policy was developed and communicated to stakeholders to 
align the Group’s practices and activities with the core pillar of 
ensuring business, social and environmental sustainability. The 
Group remains focused on minimising its contribution towards 
climate change and environmental impact through responsible 
resource management, pollution control and Group-wide 
awareness and accountability.
Digitalisation of the Group’s value chain processes has enabled 
risk mitigation in terms of process integration, data management 
and security, increased efficiency and enhanced decision 
making. This enabled seamless and improved coordination with 
suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers.
Value Chain Risks
STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group’s digital infrastructure is constantly updated and 
innovated upon to ensure the Group remains competitive, 
compliant, and relevant. The Group Cybersecurity function plays 
a crucial role in establishing strategic governance, mitigating 
risks, and ensuring cybersecurity compliance across the Group. 
The cybersecurity measures of the Group are managed by the 
respective Business Units’ IT functions, which are responsible 
for implementing and adhering to the Group Cybersecurity 
Policy to ensure a robust security posture throughout the entire 
Group. Both the IT functions and Group Cybersecurity report to 
the Group Chief Information Officer (CIO).
Sunway Digital Hub is certified with ISO 27001:2013, an 
international standard for Information Security Management 
System (ISMS). This standard provides a framework of policies 
and procedures that determine legal, physical and technical 
controls in Sunway’s information risk management. To ensure 
the Group’s Information Security is effective, Sunway Digital 
Hub conducts regular assessments, phishing simulation and an 
annual disaster recovery simulation test to examine the efficacy 
of the disaster recovery plan. Sunway Digital Hub is audited 
internally and by an external third party, as required by ISO 
27001:2013.
In 2023, the Group Cybersecurity Policy was formulated in view 
of increasing cyber threats and attacks that could potentially 
endanger the Group. The policy covers all information system 
environments which includes documentation, physical and 
logical controls, personnel, hardware, cloud workloads, software 
and information. The policy outlines the responsibilities at Group
Cybersecurity, business divisions, employees and third parties to 
ensure compliance towards this policy.

MATERIAL JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES
This statement does not cover the risk management and internal 
control framework and processes of the Group’s material joint 
ventures and associates as these areas fall within the control of their 
shareholders and management. The Group safeguards its interests 
in those entities through the appointment of representatives on their 
respective boards and, in certain cases, through their management 
or operational committees. Although the Group’s Healthcare 
division was classified as a joint venture effective 23 December 
2021, GRC will continue to review its quarterly risk reports and 
report its findings to the RMC. 
THE BOARD’S CONCLUSION
The Board is pleased to report that the state of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control framework is able to meet the 
Group’s objective to ensure good corporate governance. For the year 
under review, there was no potential or present failure or weakness 
that would have material adverse effect on the results of the Group.
The Board has also received assurance from the President and 
Group Chief Financial Officer that the Group’s risk management 
and internal control framework is operating adequately and 
effectively in all material aspects. Continuous focus on measures to 
protect and enhance shareholder value and business sustainability 
will remain a core practice for the Group.
REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITOR

Management and Internal Control as required under Paragraph 
15.23 of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad’s Main Market Listing 
Requirements. The limited assurance review was performed in 
accordance with Malaysian Approved Standard on Assurance

Management and Internal Control Included in the Annual Report.

internal control systems of the Group.
Based on their procedures performed, the external auditors have 
reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention 
which causes them to believe that this Statement is not prepared,

In FY 2023, there has been a notable return to pre-COVID-19 levels across all Sunway’s business 
segments and activities with the resurgence of face-to-face interactions with the investing 
community, marking a return to the more traditional modes of engagements.
The Group remains dedicated to its commitment for excellence in financial reporting and communication practices. Through 
continuous and extensive communication with shareholders and the wider investing community, the Group aims to provide 
valuable insights of its financial performance, business outlook and prospects, strategic direction and associated risk factors, 
thereby enhancing stakeholders’ ability to make well-informed investment decisions. There is also a rising prevalence among 
the investing community for ESG reporting. The Group emphasised communication of its sustainability goals and action plans 
alongside regular business and operational updates in a dedicated stand-alone sustainability report. 
These engagements provide the Group with inputs to pertinent matters that concern the stakeholders which can be taken into 
consideration in the Group’s business strategies. 
IR INITIATIVES IN FY 2023
While requests for physical meetings and on-site visits are increasing, many investor meetings are now conducted virtually to 
accommodate more investors’ and analysts’ requests. In FY 2023, 18 such analyst briefings were organised and held virtually.
The Group had also participated in an investor conference organised by a foreign brokerage house in Singapore at the beginning 
of the year to share the performance and prospects of the Group with small groups of investors, as well as to take on their queries 
during the meetings. 
On-site visits provide an interesting perspective for investors and analysts to have a clear overview of the Group’s portfolio and 
understand the benefits of its strategic location, connectivity and seamless integration into a township which provides the value 
proposition for the Group. During the year, Sunway Medical Centre Sunway City Kuala Lumpur and Sunway City Iskandar Puteri

financial statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any material extent;
(ii)  which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the

 On 14 August 2023, Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCity”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into a Share 
Transactions Agreement with Iskandar Asset Sdn. Bhd. (“IASB”) and Sunway Iskandar Development Sdn. Bhd. (“SIDSB”), 
a joint venture of the Group, to acquire the remaining 40% stake of SIDSB from IASB, for a total cash consideration of 
RM770,450. In addition, SunCity has subscribed for 84,229,550 non-convertible non-cumulative redeemable preference 
shares (“NCNCRPS”) in SIDSB for a total cash consideration of RM84,229,550 and SIDSB has utilised these proceeds for 
the redemption of NCNCRPS held by IASB.
 Accordingly, SIDSB and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group and have been consolidated in the 
financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.
 The financial effects on the acquisition of remaining stakes and the remeasurements of the previously held equity interests are

operations and investment holding.

Before me,
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
SUNWAY BERHAD (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Sunway Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 
2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of 
changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 192 to 378.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in 
accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRSs”), IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing 
(“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and 
Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and 
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
(a) Revenue recognition for property development 
 Revenue from sale of properties under development during the financial year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements 
is RM1,378,094,000.
 We determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in determining 
the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers, transaction price allocations and costs 
in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.
 The Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of contracts. 
Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance 
obligations.
 The Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. In estimating the 
total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations 
to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)
(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)
Key Audit Matters (contd.)
(a)  Revenue recognition for property development (contd.)
 Audit response
 Our audit procedures included the following:
(i) reviewed contracts with customers to identify distinct and material performance obligations, and compared our findings 
to the findings of the Group;
(ii) assessed estimated total costs to complete through inquiries with operational and financial personnel of the Group;
(iii) inspected documentation to support cost estimates made including contract variations and cost contingencies;
(iv) compared contract budgets to actual outcomes to assess reliability of management budgeting process and controls; and
(v) recomputed the results of the input method determined by management for revenue recognition based on verified actual 
costs incurred to-date and budgeted costs.
(b)  Revenue recognition for construction contracts
 Revenue from construction contracts during the financial year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements is 
RM1,453,814,000.
 We determined this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant judgements in estimating 
the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations and determining whether there is any exposure to 
liquidated ascertained damages (“LAD”). The progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations is measured 
using the output method, which is based on contract work certified to date over the estimated total contract sum.
 In estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations, the Group considers the estimated 
contract work completed to date and the completeness and accuracy of its estimated total contract sum, including contract 
variations, claims and contingencies.
 Audit response
 Our audit procedures included the following:
(i) inspected documentation to support the estimated total contract sum and correspondences from contract customers in 
relation to variations and claims to corroborate key judgements applied by management;
(ii) inspected documentation certified by professional consultants to support the contract work performed by the Group to-date;
(iii) recomputed the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations determined by management for revenue 
recognition based on contract work certified to-date and budgeted total contract sum;
(iv) inquired in-house operational and financial personnel of the Group to assess the merits of extension of time submitted to 
the contract customers for assessing the exposure to LAD; and
(v) inspected relevant correspondences and reports, including on-going negotiations with contract customers for the late 
delivery of contract works.
Key Audit Matters (contd.)
(c)  Valuation of derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of Sunway Healthcare Holdings Sdn. Bhd. and 
its subsidiaries (“SHH Group”)
 Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group represent the exit clauses attached to 
the Shareholders’ Agreement (“SHA”) and Share Subscription Agreement (“SSA”) entered between the Company, Sunway City 
Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCity”), SHH and Greenwood Capital Pte. Ltd. (“Greenwood”) following the partial divestment of 16% equity 
interest in SHH to Greenwood by SunCity as disclosed in Note 26 to the financial statements. The Company, SunCity, SHH 
and Greenwood had entered into a SHA to define the rights and obligations of the shareholders of SHH. As at 31 December 
2023, the fair value of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group amounted to 
RM223,868,000. 
 The determination of the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH 
Group is a key audit matter because it involves significant judgements and is subject to estimation uncertainty as subjective 
variables need to be used by management in order to derive the fair values. The key inputs and assumptions used in estimating 
the fair values include the probabilities of occurrence of the Proposed IPO, probabilities of achieving the desired Proposed IPO 
valuation, timing of the occurrence of Proposed IPO and discount rate. 
 Audit response
 Our audit procedures included the following: 
(i) read and discussed with management on the contractual terms of the SSA and SHA to gain an understanding of the 
terms in the SSA and SHA;
(ii) evaluated the appropriateness of the key inputs and assumptions used in deriving the fair values of the derivative 
liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group; 
(iii) obtained computations of management in deriving the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation 
to the partial divestment of SHH Group and compared the key inputs used against observable market data, where 
applicable; and
(iv) re-computed the fair values of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group 
based on the above key inputs and exit clauses assumptions as at the end of the reporting period. 
We have determined that there are no key audit matters to be communicated in our auditors’ report of the audit of the separate 
financial statements of the Company.
INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS’ REPORT THEREON 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the 
Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SUNWAY BERHAD (CONTD.)
INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS’ REPORT THEREON (CONTD.)
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with MFRSs, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved 
standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
(a)  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether 
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control.
(b)  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control of the Group and 
of the Company.
(c)  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Directors.
(d)  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the 
ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to 
cease to continue as a going concern.
AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise professional judgement 
and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (contd.)
(e)  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
(f)  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not 
acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 50 to the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise corporate assets, liabilities and 
expenses. 
 
 Segment revenue and expenses include transfers between business segments that are eliminated on consolidation. Segment 
results exclude the effects of transfers between business segments.

4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
(a) Capital management
 The primary objective of the Group’s and the Company’s capital management is the maintenance of a strong credit rating 
and healthy capital ratios, in order to support the Group’s businesses and maximising shareholders’ value. 
 The Group and the Company manage their capital structure by ensuring that financial commitments are met as and when 
they fall due. In addition, divestment of the Group’s non-core assets, which provides low returns are also made to optimise 
the capital structure of the Group.
 The Group and the Company monitor capital utilisation using the gearing ratio. This ratio is used to assess the appropriateness 
of the Group’s debt level, hence its capital structure. The ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt 
includes total borrowings and hire purchase with financial institutions net of cross currency swap, and perpetual sukuk less 
cash and bank balances.

 Pursuant to the requirements of Practice Note No. 17/2005 of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, the Group is 
required to maintain a consolidated shareholders’ equity of more than 25% of the issued and paid-up capital (excluding 
treasury shares) and such shareholders’ equity is not less than RM40.0 million. The Company has complied with this 
requirement for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. 
4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)
(b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies 
 The Group’s financial risk management policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available for the 
development of the Group’s businesses whilst managing its interest rate risks (both fair value and cash flow), foreign 
currency risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk and insurance risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for 
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. It is, and has been throughout the year under review, 
the Group’s policy that no trading in derivative financial instruments shall be undertaken except for the use as hedging 
instruments where appropriate and cost-efficient.
 Interest rate risk 
 The Group’s and the Company’s income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market 
interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s interest-bearing financial assets are mainly short term in nature and have 
been mostly placed in fixed deposits. 
 The Group’s and the Company’s interest rate risk arise primarily from interest bearing borrowings. The Group manages 
its interest rate exposure by monitoring a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group also entered into interest 
rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts to hedge the floating rate interest payable on certain borrowings. 
The Group closely monitors markets and output from various industry working groups on the transitions to new interest 
rate benchmark arising from the respective interest rate benchmarks reforms in various jurisdictions. At the end of 
the reporting period, the Group’s interest rate swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts are not materially 
affected by any interest rate benchmarks reforms. Approximately 31% (2022: 40%) of the Group’s borrowings after 
cross currency swap are at fixed rates of interest. 
 The interest rate profile and sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk have been disclosed in Notes 24, 25, 31, 32, 34, 
35, 37, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.
 Foreign currency risk
 The Group is not significantly exposed to foreign currency risk as the majority of the Group’s transactions, assets and 
liabilities are denominated in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”) except for foreign currency risk arising from countries in which 
certain foreign subsidiaries operate. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Singapore Dollar (“SGD”), United 
States Dollar (“USD”), Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”), Australian Dollar (“AUD”), British Pound Sterling (“GBP”) and 
Indian Rupee (“INR”). Foreign currency exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the 
operating entities are kept to an acceptable level. 
 Approximately 16% (2022: 15%) of the Group’s sales are denominated in foreign currencies whilst almost 16% (2022: 
16%) of costs are denominated in the respective functional currencies of the Group entities. 
 The Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by borrowing in the currency of the country in which the 
property or investment is located or by borrowing in currencies that match the revenue stream to be generated from its 
investments. 
 The Group also holds cash and bank balances denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes. At the end 
of the reporting period, such foreign currency balances amounted to RM350.1 million (2022: RM279.4 million). 
 Material foreign currency transactions exposures are hedged, mainly with derivative financial instruments such as forward 
foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.
 The Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from foreign 
currency borrowings as well as to minimise the interest cost. These cross currency swap contracts have expiry periods 
within 1 months to 30 months (2022: 2 months to 32 months).
 In relation to its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risks and which 
are held for long term investment purposes, the differences arising from such translation are recorded under the foreign 
currency translation reserve. These translation differences are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis.

 Liquidity risk
 The exposure of the Group to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and 
financial liabilities. The objective of the Group is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility 
through the use of stand-by credit facilities.        
       
       
4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)
(b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)
 Liquidity risk (contd.)
 The objective of the Group’s liquidity management is to maintain a balance between long term and short term borrowings 
to ensure continuity of funding at a cost efficient manner to meet its financial obligations on a timely basis. In this 
regard, the Group diligently manages its debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and various sources of funding after 
taking into account of the refinancing, repayment and funding requirements to provide an adequate liquidity buffer. 
Besides maintaining a reasonable level of cash and cash convertible investments to meet its working capital needs, the 
Group also ensures it has sufficient undrawn credit facilities available to complement its overall liquidity management. 
The Group has undrawn credit facilities of RM1,099.7 million (2022: RM1,506.0 million) at the end of the financial 
year.
     
 In addition, the Group strives to maintain available banking facilities at a reasonable level to its overall debt position. As 
far as possible, the Group raises committed funding from both capital markets and financial institutions and balances 
its portfolio with some short term funding so as to achieve overall cost effectiveness.
 At the end of the reporting period, approximately 62% (2022: 63%) of the Group’s borrowings will mature in less than 
one year based on the carrying amounts reflected in the financial statements.
 
 The analysis of financial instruments by remaining contractual maturities has been disclosed in Notes 26, 32, 33, 34, 
35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 to the financial statements.
   
 The notional amounts of performance guarantee contracts of the Group that are payable on demand are set out

Performance guarantee contracts 35,451 30,776
 Credit risk
     
 Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on 
its obligations. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables, other 
receivables and financial guarantee contracts. For other financial assets (including investment securities, cash and bank 
balances and derivatives), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating 
counterparties. 
 Receivables
 The Group’s objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk 
exposure. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers 
who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are 
monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant.

4. CAPITAL, INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTD.)
(b) Insurance and financial risk management objectives and policies (contd.)
 Credit risk (contd.)
 Financial guarantee contracts
 The Group and the Company provides financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to subsidiaries 
and joint ventures and vendors supplying to subsidiaries. The Group monitors on an ongoing basis the financial 
performance of the subsidiaries and joint ventures and the repayments made by the subsidiaries and joint ventures to 
the banks and vendors.
 The credit risk concentration profiles have been disclosed in Notes 24, 25 and 37 to the financial statements.
 Market risk 
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the financial instruments of the Group would fluctuate 
because of changes in market prices (other than interest or exchange rates).
 
 The Group is exposed to equity price risks arising from quoted investments held by the Group. These investments are 
classified as financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss, except for those investments which are held 
for strategic rather than trading purposes. Such investments are classified as financial assets designated at fair value 
through other comprehensive income.
 To manage its price risk arising from its investments, the Group diversifies its portfolio in accordance with the limits set 
by the Group.  
 The sensitivity analysis of market risk has been disclosed in Notes 19, 28 and 31 to the financial statements.
 Insurance risk
 The most significant risks arising from the performance guarantees contracts are compensation for delays in delivery of 
construction contracts that result in a decline in profit margins from the construction contracts of the Group. Since the 
guarantee extends to more than a year, there is also inflation risk.
 As at the end of the reporting period, there is no significant exposure of insurance risk of the Group as the expected 
future cash outflows arising from performance guarantee contracts are negligible.

5. REVENUE (CONTD.)
(a) Revenue from property development and construction contracts
 Contracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and are therefore accounted for as separate 
performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on 
the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost 
plus margin.
 Revenue from property development and construction contracts are measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under 
the agreement.
 Revenue is recognised as and when control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group 
would collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that would be transferred to the 
customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may 
transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the performance of the Group 
does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for 
performance completed to date.
 Revenue from property development 
 Revenue from sale of properties under development is recognised over the period of the contract using the input method 
by reference to the costs incurred for work performed to date against the estimated costs to completion if control of the 
asset transfers over time. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the 
asset. 
 Significant judgement is required in determining the satisfaction of performance obligations as stated in the contracts 
with customers, transaction price allocations and costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time. 
 The Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which are judgmental in the context of 
contracts. Transaction prices are determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified 
performance obligations. The Group also estimates total contract costs in applying the input method to recognise 
revenue over time. In estimating the total costs to complete, the Group considers the completeness and accuracy of its 
costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations, claims and cost contingencies.
 There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of properties under development as the 
contracts are on normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.
 Revenue from construction contracts 
 Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over the period of the contract using the output method by reference 
to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation if control of the asset transfers over time. 
The output method recognises revenue on the basis of direct measurements of value to the customer of the construction 
work performed to date relative to the remaining construction work promised under the contract, which is based on the 
contract work certified to date over the estimated total contract sum.
 If control of asset transfers at a point in time, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control 
of the asset.
5. REVENUE (CONTD.)
(a) Revenue from property development and construction contracts (contd.)
 Revenue from construction contracts (contd.)
 The Group determines the transaction price of a construction contract after considering the effect of variable consideration, 
constraining estimates of variable consideration, effect of significant financing component, non-cash consideration and 
consideration payable to customer.
 Significant judgement is required in estimating the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations 
and in assessing the exposures to Liquidated Ascertained Damages (“LAD”) based on the facts and circumstances of the 
relevant construction projects, including projects that had been served with certificates of non-achievement for project 
delays. In making these judgements, the Group evaluates based on experience and by relying on the work of specialists. 
 Information on trade receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers are disclosed in 
Notes 24 and 30 to the financial statements respectively.
(b)  Sale of completed properties and land
 The Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties and land, when the control of the 
properties and land have been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties and land have been completed 
and delivered to the customers and it is probable that the Group will collect the considerations to which it would be 
entitled to in exchange for the assets sold.
 There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of completed properties and land as the 
sales are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.
(c) Sale of goods and services, rights of enjoyment and club subscription fees 
 Revenue from sale of products and services rendered is recognised at a point in time when the products have been 
transferred or the services have been rendered to the customers and coincide with the delivery of products and services 
and acceptance by customers.
 There is no material right of return and warranty provided to the customers on the sale of products and services rendered.
 There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of products and services rendered as the 
sales or services are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.
 Entrance fees collected for rights of enjoyment of facilities are recognised when tickets are utilised.
 Club subscription fees are recognised on the accrual basis.
(d) Management fees
 Management fees from the management of real estate investment funds activity and the provision of management 
services are recognised over time when customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits.
(e) Interest advances and share financing
 Interest advances and share financing are recognised as income on accrual basis.

(b)  (contd.)
 Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) had, vide its letter dated 23 February 2024, approved the 
Company’s application for the listing and quotation of up to 184,400,800 new ordinary shares to be issued by the 
Company pursuant to the DRS in respect of the Second Interim Dividend on the Main Market of Bursa Securities.
 The issue price of the new ordinary shares has been fixed on 5 March 2024 (“Price Fixing Date”) at RM2.51 per new 
ordinary share. The issue price is fixed based on the five (5) day volume weighted average market price (“VWAMP”) of 
ordinary shares in the Company (“Sunway Shares”) of RM2.8167 up to and including 4 March 2024, being the last 
trading day before the Price Fixing Date, after adjusting for the following: 
(i)  the Second Interim Dividend of RM0.035 per ordinary share to the five (5) day VWAMP of Sunway Shares  
(“Ex-Dividend VWAMP”); and
(ii)  a discount of RM0.2717, which is approximately 9.77% discount to the Ex-Dividend VWAMP of RM2.7817.
 The books closure date for the Second Interim Dividend has been fixed on 19 March 2024 and will be paid on 18 April 
2024. The new ordinary shares will be listed on 19 April 2024. 
Under the DRS, shareholders will have the following options:
(i) to elect to participate by reinvesting the entire Second Interim Dividend into new ordinary shares at the issue price;
(ii)  to elect to participate by reinvesting part of the Second Interim Dividend into new ordinary shares at the issue 
price, and receive the balance portion in cash; or
     
(iii)  to elect not to participate in the reinvestment option and thereby receive the entire Second Interim Dividend in 
cash.

15. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTD.)
(a)  Leasehold land, right-of-use land and buildings, right-of-use motor vehicles and right-of-use equipment represent right-
of-use assets arising from lease arrangements that do not meet the definition of investment property.
(b)  The Group assessed whether there are any indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment during the financial 
year. In doing this, management considered the current environment, taking into consideration the performance of Cash 
Generating Units (“CGUs”). Management considered certain CGUs which are loss-making as impairment indications.
 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived 
from financial budgets approved by management. 
 Management has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. 
These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues 
and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.
 Management has determined that the recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment are lower than 
their carrying amounts. Accordingly, impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of the Group amounted to 
RM551,000 was recognised within administrative and other expenses in the statements of profit or loss in the current 
financial year. The pre-tax discount rates applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts 
range from 6.9% to 7.8% (2022: 5.5% to 9.5%).
 Management has also determined that the recoverable amounts of certain property, plant and equipment are higher 
than their carrying amounts. Accordingly, reversals of impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of the Group 
amounted to RM20,184,000 was recognised within other income in the statements of profit or loss in the current 
financial year. The pre-tax discount rate applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amount is 
7.53%.
 
(c)  All items of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are initially recorded at cost. After initial 
recognition, property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets as follows:
 Buildings   2% 
 Renovations  4% - 33% 
 Plant and machinery  5% - 20% 
 Motor vehicles  10% - 20% 
 Equipment, furniture and fittings  5% - 33%
 Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress included in property, 
plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.
 Quarry development expenditure consists of expenditure incurred to construct infrastructure to facilitate the quarry 
operations. Quarry development expenditure is amortised over the extractable rock reserves period, ranging from 3 to 80 
years.
  
 The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment (excluding right-of-use assets) are estimated based 
on common life expectancies and commercial factors applied in the various respective industries.
 Changes in expected level of usage, occupancy rates and economic development could impact the economic useful lives 
and the residual values of these assets, and hence future depreciation charges on such assets could be revised.
15. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTD.)
(d)  The right-of-use assets under property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial 
amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases.
 After initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
 The right-of-use assets are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the periods of the lease terms. The principal 
depreciation periods are as follows:
 Leasehold land  over the lease periods from 45 to 99 years
 Land and buildings  over the lease periods from 1 to 47 years
 Motor vehicles and equipment  over the lease periods from 1 to 5 years
(e)  During the financial year, the Group and the Company made the following cash payments to purchase property, plant 
and equipment:

 Intangible assets with finite lives such as software, operating right and data costs are initially measured at cost. After initial 
recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated economic useful lives.
 Impairment losses on intangible assets amounting to RM21,000 have been recognised during the financial year due to the 
recoverable amount of the intangible assets in the CGU is lower than its carrying amount.
     
 Software
 Software that does not form an integral part of the related hardware is treated as intangible asset with finite life and is 
amortised over its estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years.
 Operating right
 Operating right relates to the exclusive right granted by a third party to operate and manage the park and ride facilities in the 
Group. Operating right has finite useful life and is amortised over its estimated useful life of 30 years.

16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTD.)
 Data cost
 Data cost represents the database of corporate information used for the provision of credit reference, credit rating and other 
related services. Data cost has finite life and is amortised over its estimated useful life of 5 years.
 Trademark and brand name
 The costs of trademark and brand name acquired represent their fair values as at the date of acquisition. The useful lives of 
trademark and brand name are estimated to be indefinite because based on the current market share of the trademark and 
brand name, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the trademark and brand name are 
expected to generate net cash flows to the Group. Trademark and brand name are stated at cost less any impairment losses. 
The carrying amounts of trademark and brand name are reviewed annually and adjusted for impairment where they are 
considered necessary.
 The carrying amounts of trademark and brand name have been allocated to the CGU identified from the others segment - 
pharmaceutical. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow 
projections derived from financial budgets approved by management. The disclosure of key inputs and assumptions are similar 
to the impairment assessment on the goodwill, which have been set out in Note 22 to the financial statements.

 The carrying amounts of the investment properties and certain investment properties under construction as at 31 December 
2023 and 31 December 2022 were based on valuations carried out by Knight Frank Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. and CBRE Limited. 
Fair value is determined primarily based on investment and comparison approaches. The fair value measurements of the 
investment properties are based on the highest and best use, which do not differ from their actual use.
  
(a)  Long term leasehold land represent right-of-use asset arising from lease arrangements that meet the definition of 
investment property.

(b)  Investment properties (excluding right-of-use assets) are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. 
Investment properties under right-of-use assets are initially measured at costs, which comprise the initial amount of the 
lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the end of the 
reporting period and changes in fair value are included in profit or loss. Fair value gain would be adjusted after taking 
into consideration of the difference in recognising the rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and 
rental income billed to the tenant in the current financial year, where applicable.
   
 If the Group determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably determinable 
but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably determinable when construction is completed, the Group shall 
measure that investment property under construction at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably determinable 
or construction is completed (whichever is earlier). Once the Group is able to measure reliably the fair value of an 
investment property under construction that has previously been measured at cost, the Group shall measure that property 
at its fair value.
          
 External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets. Selection criteria of external valuers include market 
knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. Management decides, after 
discussions with the external valuers of the Group, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case and 
compares changes in fair value with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable. Management 
also verifies major inputs by agreeing information in the valuation to contracts and other relevant documents.
(c)  Interest expense capitalised during the financial year under investment properties under construction of the Group 
amounting to RM15,270,000 (2022: RM10,345,000) at interest rates ranging from 4.56% to 5.79% (2022: 4.19% 
to 5.33%) per annum.

17. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONTD.)
(f)  Methods of valuation 
 Comparison method 
 The comparison/cost method of valuation entails separate valuations of the land and buildings to arrive at the market 
value of the subject property.
 Under the comparison method, a property’s fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions. This approach is 
based upon the principle of substitution under which a potential buyer would not pay more for the property than it would 
cost to buy a comparable substitute property. In theory, the best comparable sale would be an exact duplicate of the 
subject property and would indicate, by the known selling price of the duplicate, the price for which the subject property 
could be sold. 
 The land is valued by reference to transactions of similar lands in surrounding with adjustments made for differences in 
location, terrain, size and shape of the land, tenure, title restrictions, if any and other relevant characteristics. 
 Completed buildings are valued by reference to the current estimates on constructional costs to erect equivalent buildings, 
taking into consideration of similar accommodation in terms of size, construction, finishes contractors’ overheads, fees 
and profits. Appropriate adjustments are then made for the factors of obsolescence and existing physical condition of 
the building.
 Buildings under construction are valued by reference to the total development costs incurred to date plus profits expected 
from its designated usage, discounted to their present value at a discount rate that reflects current market assessment 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
 In the previous financial year, all investment properties valued using the comparison method are transferred from Level 
2 to Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
 Investment method
 A property’s fair value is estimated using explicit assumptions regarding the benefits and liabilities of ownership over 
the asset’s life including an exit or terminal value. As an accepted method within the income approach to valuation, the 
investment method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To this projected cash 
flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream 
associated with the real property.
 The duration of the cash flow and the specific timing of inflows and outflows are determined by events such as rent 
reviews, lease renewal and related lease up periods, re-letting, redevelopment, or refurbishment. The appropriate duration 
is typically driven by market behaviour that is a characteristic of the class of real property. In the case of investment 
properties, periodic cash flow is typically estimated as gross income less vacancy, non-recoverable expenses, collection 
losses, lease incentives, maintenance cost, agent and commission costs and other operating and management expenses. 
The series of periodic net operating incomes, along with an estimate of the terminal value anticipated at the end of the 
projection period, is then discounted.
 Significant increases/(decreases) in estimated rental value and outgoings per annum in isolation would result in a 
significant higher/(lower) fair value of the properties. Significant increases/(decreases) in market yield and discount rate 
in isolation would result in a significantly (lower)/higher fair value.
 Generally, a change in the assumption made for the estimated rental value is accompanied by a directionally similar 
change in the rent growth per annum and discount rate.

18. INVENTORIES (CONTD.)
(e)  Property development costs not recognised as an expense are recognised as an asset measured at the lower of cost and 
net realisable value. The asset is subsequently credited over to profit or loss and recognised as an expense when the 
control of the asset is transferred to the customer.
 The Group recognises in profit or loss the property development revenue and costs by reference to the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligations at the reporting period. It is measured based on direct 
measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customers and the Group’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction 
of the performance obligation. Significant judgement is required in determining the completeness and accuracy of the 
budgets and the extent of the costs incurred.
 Substantial changes in cost estimates can have a significant effect on the profitability of the Group in future periods. 
In making the above judgement, the Group relies on past experience and work of specialists. Transaction prices are 
determined based on estimated profit margins prior to its allocation to the identified performance obligations.
(f)  Completed properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost consists of cost associated 
with the acquisition of land, direct costs and appropriate proportions of common costs attributable for developing the 
properties until completion.
(g)  Costs of trading inventories, food and beverages and consumables are determined on a weighted average basis, while 
cost of raw materials, work in progress and finished goods are determined on a weighted average and first in, first out 
basis.
(h)  The amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the financial year are included in the cost of sales of the 
Group as disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.
(i)  A write-down of inventories to net realisable value and write-off of inventories of RM5,369,000 (2022: RM4,367,000) 
and RM5,527,000 (2022: RM821,000) respectively were made during the year.
(j)  The Group reversed RM41,000 (2022: RM11,000) in respect of inventories written down in the previous financial years 
that were subsequently not required as the Group was able to sell those inventories above their carrying amounts.
(k)  Interest expense capitalised under property development costs and land held for development costs of the Group 
amounted to RM44,595,000 (2022: RM40,004,000) and RM68,383,000 (2022: RM40,991,000) at interest rates 
ranging from 3.28% to 7.65% (2022: 3.12% to 6.50%) respectively.

19. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES (CONTD.)
(a)  Investments in subsidiaries other than quoted units in wholesale funds are stated in the separate financial statements 
of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any. 
 Quoted units in wholesale funds are classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss pursuant 
to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The fair value of quoted units in wholesale funds is categorised as Level 2 in the fair 
value hierarchy. The fair value of quoted units in wholesale funds are determined based on net asset value of the funds 
at the close of business on the reporting date. There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the 
financial year.
(b)  All components of non-controlling interests shall be measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another 
measurement basis is required by MFRSs. The choice of measurement basis is made on a combination-by-combination 
basis. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests 
at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.
(c)  The Company and/or its subsidiaries review the investments in subsidiaries measured at cost for impairment when there 
is an indication of impairment.
 The recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are assessed by reference to the fair value less cost to sell 
of the underlying assets or the value-in-use of the respective subsidiaries.
 The value-in-use is the net present value of the projected future cash flows derived from the business operations of the 
respective subsidiaries discounted at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. For such discounted cash flow method, it 
involves the use of estimated future results and a set of assumptions to support their income and cash flows. Judgement 
had also been used to determine the pre-tax discount rate for the cash flows and the future growth rate of the business 
of the entities. The value-in-use were determined using pre-tax discount rates of 6.9% to 7.8% (2022: 5.5% to 9.5%).
(d)  The Group and the Company determined that their placements in wholesale funds are in substance, structured entities 
under their control in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, taking into consideration their 
power over the wholesale funds, exposure or rights to variable returns from their involvement with the wholesale funds 
and their ability to use their power over the wholesale funds to affect the amount of their returns. 
  
 The Group and the Company invested in these wholesale funds with the objective of achieving short term to long term 
income for their treasury management purposes. The funds are managed by the respective fund managers, who apply 
various investment strategies to accomplish their respective investment objectives. Their operations are financed through 
the creation of investee fund units, which in turn entitle the holders to variable returns and fair values in the respective 
wholesale fund’s net assets.
 In relation to this, the Group holds 74% to 100% (2022: 76% to 100%) directly in these wholesale funds as disclosed 
in Note 50 to the financial statements, which are all established in Malaysia. The Group and the Company are exposed 
to, or has rights to variable returns from their involvements in these funds. Accordingly, these funds are deemed as 
subsidiaries of the Group and of the Company and have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
         
 During the current financial year, the Company had net redemptions of units in its wholesale funds amounting to 
RM40,457,000 (2022: RM290,803,000).

(iii)  SIDSB will redeem 76,274,552 NCNCRPS held by IASB in the share capital of SIDSB at a redemption price of 
RM84,229,550.
 Consequent to the completion of the Proposed Acquisition and redemption of NCNCRPS on 21 August 2023, the 
Group had obtained control of SIDSB in accordance with MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, 
SIDSB and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group and have been consolidated in the financial 
statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.
 The fair value and the carrying amounts of the identifiable assets and liabilities of SIDSB and its subsidiaries as at the 
date of acquisition were as follows:
 Fair value

 acquisition
 RM’000 
 
 Carrying

(f)  Acquisition of remaining stakes in Sunway Iskandar Development Sdn. Bhd. (“SIDSB”), which was previously a joint 
venture of the Group (contd.)
 
Group
 2023

Total consideration transferred  85,000 
Fair value of identifiable net assets  (182,703)
Fair value of previously held equity interest in SIDSB  107,500 
Goodwill  9,797 
The effects of the acquisition on cash flows of the Group are as follows:
 
Group
 2023 
 RM’000 
Total consideration for equity interest acquired  85,000 
Less: Cash and cash equivalents of subsidiary acquired  (11)
Net cash outflow of the Group on acquisition  84,989 
 The remeasurement to fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in SIDSB resulted in a loss of RM489,000, 
which has been recognised in other expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
 SIDSB and its subsidiaries have contributed a total loss of RM11,284,000 in the 5 months to 31 December 2023 and 
if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management estimated the total loss for the financial year ended 31 
December 2023 would have been RM11,957,000.
(g)  In the previous financial year, the Group had entered into Supplemental Letter Agreements with respective joint venturers 
of Sunway Artessa Sdn. Bhd. (“Sunway Artessa”), Sunway Velocity Two Sdn. Bhd. (“Sunway Velocity Two”) and Daksina 
Harta Sdn. Bhd. (“Daksina Harta”) to vary certain terms in respective Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreements, which 
resulted in the Group obtaining controls of Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta in accordance with 
MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Accordingly, Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta became subsidiaries of the Group and had been 
consolidated in the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2022.
 The financial effects on the changes in the composition of the Group arising from the remeasurements of the previously 
held equity interests in Sunway Artessa, Sunway Velocity Two and Daksina Harta were RM66,182,000 in the previous 
financial year.
(h)  The other winding up and strike off of subsidiaries did not have any material effect on the financial results and position 
of the Group. 
(i)  Sensitivity analysis of quoted units in wholesale funds
 A change of 1% in funds’ prices, assuming all other variables constant, at the end of the reporting period would resulted 
in the profit net of tax of the Company to be higher/(lower) by RM3,000 (2022: RM408,000).

activities nor it has any joint control on the arrangement. Thus, the Group has treated its interest in Orbit Malaysia Fund as an associate, considering 
its power to exercise significant influence.
@ The dilution of the Group’s effective equity interest in Elite REIT is due to the issuance of new units under Elite REIT’s Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
on 20 September 2023.
(e)  Significant influence is presumed not to exist when an entity hold less than 20% of the voting rights of another entity, 
unless it can be clearly demonstrated otherwise.
 The Group holds a nineteen point three three percent (19.33%) interest in Gopeng for which the Group has determined 
that it holds significant influence as the Group has two representatives on the Board of Directors of Gopeng, who are able 
to participate in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions.
 The Group holds a five point eight four percent (5.84%) interest in Elite REIT for which the Group has determined that 
it holds significant influence as the Group has a representative on the Board of Directors of Elite REIT, who is able to 
participate in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions.
 The Group holds a fifteen percent (15%) interest in Elite REIT Manager for which the Group has determined that it holds 
significant influence as the Group has a representative on the Board of Directors of Elite REIT Manager, who is able to 
participate in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends or other distributions.
 The Group holds a thirteen point six four percent (13.64%) interest in ISZL Consortium for which the Group has 
determined that it holds significant influence as the Group has a representative on the Board of Directors of ISZL 
Consortium, who is able to participate in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends 
or other distributions.
 Based on these, the Group considers that it has the power to exercise significant influence and has treated its interests 
in Gopeng, Elite REIT, Elite REIT Manager and ISZL Consortium as associates.

20. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (CONTD.)
(f)  The Group assessed whether there are any indications of impairment during the financial year. In doing this, management 
considered the current environments, taking into consideration the performance of CGUs. Management has considered 
the drop in market values of quoted shares in certain associates in the current financial year as impairment indications.
 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections derived 
from financial budgets approved by management. 
 Management has made estimates about future results and key assumptions applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs. 
These key assumptions are applied to cash flow projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues 
and operating profit margins, as well as determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates. 
 The market values of the Group’s investment in Sunway REIT, Gopeng and Elite REIT (collectively known as “Listed 
Associates”) are below the carrying amounts of the Group’s interest in the Listed Associates as at 31 December 2023. 
Nevertheless, the carrying amounts are supported by the net assets of these associates as well as future cash flows to 
be generated by these associates. Management has determined that the recoverable amounts of these investments in 
associates exceed their carrying amounts and with the relatively resilient fundamentals of these associates, the Group 
is of the view that the carrying amounts of the investments in associates are recoverable and should not be impacted by 
the fluctuation of the share price of these associates, therefore no further impairment loss is required at this juncture. 
The average pre-tax discount rate applied on the cash flow projections in determining the recoverable amounts is 5.7% 
(2022: 6.2%). 
(g)  During the financial year, the Group completed the following subscriptions, capital injection, divestment and acquisition 
of shares:
(i)  Sunway Innovation Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. (“SHSB”), which in turn 
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had subscribed 35,000 ordinary shares, representing 35% equity 
interest in The Hive Southeast Asia Sdn. Bhd. for a cash consideration of RM35,000;
(ii)  Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCity”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into an internal 
reorganisation agreement to relocate its equity investments in Superseed II Ventures (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. to 
Superseed II Fund, L.P., and a loss on redemption of redeemable preference shares of RM641,000 had been 
recognised within other expenses in the statements of profit or loss. On 17 January 2023, SunCity had injected 
USD349,762 (equivalent to RM1,517,303) into Superseed II Fund, L.P. and further injected USD675,564 
(equivalent to RM3,096,662) from 4 April 2023 to 6 December 2023;
(iii)  On 11 May 2023 and 7 August 2023, SunCity had injected USD781,229 (equivalent to RM3,478,292) and 
USD33,055 (equivalent to RM137,229) respectively into Orbit Malaysia Fund 1, L.P.;
(iv)  On 27 October 2023, Sunway Marketing Sdn. Bhd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SHSB, which in turn is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, had divested the remaining 30% equity interest in its associate, Buildtrend 
B.S.G. (M) Sdn. Bhd. upon dissolution of the associate with no material effect; and 
(v)  On 27 October 2023, Sunway RE Capital Pte. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SunCity, had subscribed 
for additional 150,000 ordinary shares in the share capital of Elite REIT Manager for a total consideration of 
SGD150,000 (equivalent to RM515,754).        
 
(h)  The details of the Group’s proportionate share of contingent liability in relation to a material litigation of Sunway REIT 
are disclosed in Note 48(a) to the financial statements.

22. GOODWILL (CONTD.)
 Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
 The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the value-in-use 
of the CGU to which goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of 
those cash flows.
 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on 
financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period, with a terminal value thereafter. The key assumptions 
used for value-in-use calculations for the major business segments are:
Quarry
%
Construction
%
Property
investment
%
Others -
pharmaceutical
%
At 31 December 2023
Gross margin 11.0 9.5 40.6 3.9
Growth rate 10.9 2.2 18.3 25.6
Discount rate 7.5 7.8 7.5 7.5
At 31 December 2022
Gross margin 9.5 10.1 40.7 7.0
Growth rate 24.2 8.8 13.3 22.7
Discount rate 9.1 8.1 9.0 9.1
 The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake 
impairment testing of goodwill:
(i)  Budgeted gross margin
 The basis used to determine the value assigned to the budgeted gross margins is the average gross margins achieved in 
the year immediately before the budgeted year adjusted for expected efficiency improvements or deficiency.
(ii)  Growth rate
 The growth rate used is based on anticipated growth rates of the respective CGU obtained from financial budgets 
approved by management. The financial budgets cover a period of three years with no terminal growth rate thereafter.
(iii)  Discount rate
 The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
22. GOODWILL (CONTD.)
 Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations (contd.)
 The following describes each key assumption on which management has based its cash flow projections to undertake 
impairment testing of goodwill: (contd.)
 The Group has adopted the Expected Cash Flow approach in performing its impairment assessment of goodwill on consolidation 
during the current financial year. The cash flow projections used in determining the value-in-use calculations were probability 
weighted based on the following scenarios:
Scenario Weighting Assumptions
 
Base Case 75% Based on the key assumptions above.
Best Case 10% Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 104% and 96% of 
base case respectively for a period of three (3) years.
Worst Case 15% Revenue and cost of sales annual growth rates are forecasted to be 96% and 104% of 
base case respectively for a period of three (3) years.
 The above key assumptions are determined based on management’s assessment of future trends in the respective business 
segments. Any differences in expectations from the original estimates might impact the impairment losses amount in respect 
of the goodwill of the Group.
 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
 With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of each of the major business segments, management believes that no reasonably 
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to materially exceed their 
recoverable amounts.

 The Group and the Company have assessed the likelihood of sufficient future profits available to recover the amounts of 
deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as they have 
arisen in companies that have a recent history of losses or in companies where future taxable profits may be insufficient 
to trigger the utilisation of these items.
 The amount and availability of these items to be carried forward up to the periods as disclosed above are subject to the 
agreement of the respective local tax authorities.
(c)  During the 2024 Budget Announcement on 13 October 2023, the Minister of Finance announced that the Global 
Minimum Tax (“GMT”) would be implemented in Malaysia. On 29 December 2023, the parliament has gazetted the 
GMT legislation via the Finance Act (No. 2) 2023 and the said rules will come into effect from financial years beginning 
on or after 1 January 2025. GMT shall apply if a group has annual revenue of seven hundred and fifty million euro or 
more as specified in the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity (“UPE”) in at least two of the 
four consecutive financial years immediately preceding tested financial year. The assessment need to be carried out for 
each tested financial year to determine whether the group is within the scope or not. Based on the past years annual 
revenue recorded in the consolidated financial statements of the UPE, the Group is within the scope of the enacted GMT 
legislation for financial year 2025. However, the Group applies the exception to recognise and disclose information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to GMT.
 Under the GMT legislation, the Group is liable to pay top-up tax for the difference between the minimum rate of 15% and 
the Group’s jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under the GMT rules (GloBE ETR) for each jurisdiction where the 
Group has operation therein. Due to uncertainties surrounding when and how each jurisdiction will enact the legislations, 
the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable. The Group is 
currently working with tax specialists to assess the impact of the GMT legislation on the Group.

 The amount due from a related party is unsecured, non-interest bearing and the credit period is generally for a period of 
30 days to 90 days (2022: 30 days to 90 days), except for an amount of RM236,000 (2022: RM990,000), which bears 
interest at rate of 7.28% (2022: 7.28% to 8.00%). The relationship with the related party is as disclosed in Note 49 to 
the financial statements.
(b)  Total trade receivables are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost.
(c)  The Group’s primary exposure to credit risk arises through its trading activities. The Group’s trading terms 
with its customers are mainly on credit. The credit period is generally for a period of 30 days to 120 days 
(2022: 30 days to 120 days). Each customer has a maximum credit limit. The Group seeks to maintain strict control over 
its outstanding receivables and has a credit control department to minimise credit risk. Overdue balances are reviewed 
regularly by senior management. In view of the aforementioned and the fact that the Group’s trade receivables relate to 
a large number of diversified customers, there is no significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables are non-
interest bearing except as stated in Note 24(l) to the financial statements.

receivables and hire purchase receivables.
(g)  Impairment for trade receivables and contract assets that do not contain a significant financing component are recognised 
based on the simplified approach using the lifetime expected credit losses.
 Impairment for trade receivables that contain significant financing component such as finance lease receivables, hire 
purchase receivables and loans and advances are recognised based on the general approach within MFRS 9 using the 
forward looking expected credit loss model as disclosed in Note 25(d) to the financial statements.
 Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of the asset. The maximum period considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum 
contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.
 The Group considers credit loss experience and observable data such as current changes and future forecasts in economic 
conditions by market segment of the Group as identified in Note 3 to the financial statements to estimate the amount of 
expected impairment loss. The methodology and assumptions including any forecasts of future economic conditions are 
reviewed regularly.
 During this process, the probability of non-payment by the trade receivables is adjusted by forward looking information and 
multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the 
trade receivables. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force 
participation rate, Malaysian Property House Index Growth Rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic 
factors of the forward looking information. For trade receivables, which are reported net, such impairments are recorded 
in a separate impairment account with the loss being recognised within the statements of profit or loss. On confirmation 
that the trade receivable would not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset would be written off against the 
associated impairment.

(j)  Exposure to credit risk
 Concentration of credit risk relating to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s many varied customers. These 
customers are internationally dispersed, engage in a wide spectrum of activities, and sell in a variety of end markets. The 
Group’s historical experience in the collection of accounts receivable falls within the recorded allowances. Due to these 
factors, management believes that no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is inherent in 
the Group’s trade receivables.
(k)  The weighted average interest rates per annum of trade receivables that were effective as at end of each reporting period 
were as follows:
Group
2023
%
2022
%
Trade receivables 4.10 3.79
Finance lease receivables 10.36 -
Hire purchase receivables 3.45 3.24
Loans and advances 5.90 5.92
24. TRADE RECEIVABLES (CONTD.)
(l)  At the end of the reporting period, the interest rate profile of the interest-bearing trade receivables was:

2023
RM’000
2022
RM’000
Fixed rate 312,351 299,700
Variable rate 850,850 265,797
 Sensitivity analysis for fixed rate trade receivables at the end of the reporting period is not presented as it is not affected 
by changes in interest rates.
 For variable rate trade receivables, a change of 25 basis points in interest rates, assuming all other variables remained 
constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the profit net of tax of the Group to be higher/(lower) by 
RM1,617,000 (2022: RM505,000).
(m)  The carrying amounts of non-current finance lease receivables, hire purchase receivables and loans and advances 
approximate their fair values as their interest rates are priced at reasonable approximation of the market interest rates as 
at the end of the reporting period.
(n)  The fair values of finance lease receivables, hire purchase receivables and loans and advances are categorised as Level 
3 in the fair value hierarchy, which are estimated based on expected future cash flows discounted at the market rate of 
interest as at the end of the reporting period. There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the 
financial year.

RM’000
2023
RM’000
2022
RM’000
Active Equity Sdn. Bhd. Group 112  273  66 59
 The amount due from a related party is unsecured, non-interest bearing and the credit period is generally for a period of 
30 days to 90 days (2022: 30 days to 90 days). The relationship with the related party is as disclosed in Note 49 to the 
financial statements.
(b)  Total other receivables, net of prepayments are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost.
(c)  Included in deposits of the Group are deposits paid for acquisition of land held for property development of 
RM28,500,000 in the current financial year.
(d)  Impairment for trade receivables with significant financing component, quasi-equity loans, other receivables, amounts 
due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts are recognised based on the 
general approach within MFRS 9 using the forward looking expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. The methodology used 
to determine the amount of the impairment is based on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition of the financial asset. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether 
there has been a significant increase in credit risk for financial assets by comparing the risk of default occurring over 
the expected life with the risk of default since initial recognition. For those in which the credit risk has not increased 
significantly since initial recognition of the financial asset, twelve-month expected credit losses along with gross interest 
income are recognised. For those in which credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime expected credit losses along 
with the gross interest income are recognised. For those that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime expected 
credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised.
 Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the 
expected life of the asset, while twelve-month expected credit losses are the portion of expected credit losses that result 
from default events that are possible within the twelve months after the end of the reporting period. The maximum period 
considered when estimating expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period over which the Group and the 
Company are exposed to credit risk.
 The Group defined significant increase in credit risk based on operating performance of the receivables, changes to 
contractual terms, payment trends and past due information.
 The probability of non-payment by quasi-equity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and 
joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts is adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amount 
of the expected loss arising from default to determine the twelve-month or lifetime expected credit loss for the quasi-
equity loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee 
contracts. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment rate, inflation rate, labour force 
participation rate, Malaysian Property House Index Growth Rate and consumer price index as the key macroeconomic 
factors of the forward looking information.
 It requires management to exercise significant judgement in determining the probability of default by quasi-equity 
loans, other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and financial guarantee contracts, 
appropriate forward looking information and significant increase in credit risk.

(a)  Derivatives are classified as at fair value through profit or loss, and subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes 
in fair value being recognised in profit or loss.
(b)  The Group entered into derivatives as follows:
(i)  Interest rate swap
 An interest rate swap is a derivative in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for another party’s 
stream of cash flow. During the financial year, the Group had entered into interest rate swap to exchange floating 
interest rate for fixed interest rate in order to minimise the exposure from fluctuation of interest rate. This interest 
rate swap received floating interest rate equalled to Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SOR”) per annum and paid fixed 
rate of interest of 3.29% per annum.
 The fair values of the interest rate swap contracts were determined by using the mark to market values at the end 
of the reporting period and changes in the fair value was recognised in the profit or loss.
 Interest rate swap contracts were valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most 
frequently applied valuation techniques included swap models, using present value calculations. The models 
incorporate various inputs included the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.
26. DERIVATIVES (CONTD.)
(b)  The Group entered into derivatives as follows: (contd.)
(ii)  Foreign currency forward contracts
 The Group entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage some of the transaction exposure. These 
contracts are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposure and fair value changes 
exposure. The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to 
foreign currency exchange risks arising from forecasted expenditure. Where a cash flow hedge qualifies for hedge 
accounting, the effective portion of gains or losses on remeasuring the fair value of the hedging instrument are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item affects profit or loss, then 
the gains or losses are transferred to the profit or loss. Gains or losses on any portion of the hedge determined to 
be ineffective are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
 Forward currency contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The derivatives 
arising from the forward currency contracts are stated at fair value using the prevailing market rate. The fair value 
changes are attributable to changes in foreign exchange spot and forward rate.
(iii)  Cross currency swap contracts
 The Group entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising 
from foreign currency borrowings, which was entered into to minimise the interest cost. The Group uses cash 
flow hedges to mitigate the risk of variability of future cash flows attributable to foreign currency and interest rate 
fluctuations over the hedging period on the foreign currency borrowings. Where a cash flow hedge qualifies for 
hedge accounting, the effective portion of gains or losses on remeasuring the fair value of the hedging instrument 
are recognised directly in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item affects profit or loss, 
then the gains or losses are transferred to the profit or loss. Gains or losses on any portion of the hedge determined 
to be ineffective are recognised immediately in the profit or loss.
 Cross currency swap contracts are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs. The most 
frequently applied valuation techniques include swap models, using present value calculations. The models 
incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.
(iv)  Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group
 Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group represent the exit clauses 
attached to the Shareholders’ Agreement (“SHA”) and Share Subscription Agreement (“SSA”) entered between 
the Company, SunCity, SHH and Greenwood Capital Pte. Ltd. (“Greenwood”) following the partial divestment of 
16% equity interest in SHH to Greenwood by SunCity on 23 December 2021. The Company, SunCity, SHH and 
Greenwood had entered into a SHA to define the rights and obligations of the shareholders of SHH.
 In accordance with the SHA, Greenwood has the right but not the obligation to initiate the Joint Sale or the Put 
Exit if the Proposed Initial Public Offer ("IPO") has not occurred on or before the eighth (8 th ) anniversary of Initial 
Closing or such extended period up to 180 days from the 8th anniversary of the Initial Closing (“Proposed IPO 
Delay Event”). Accordingly, Greenwood was granted a put option, whereby it shall have the right to require SunCity 
to acquire all its securities held for the Put Consideration. The “Put Consideration” shall be an amount equal to 
the amount that will enable Greenwood to achieve the USD IRR of no less than 18.5% upon completion of the Put 
Option.

(iv)  Derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group (contd.)
 Furthermore, SunCity has agreed to offer Greenwood a valuation adjustment in the event its targeted Ringgit 
Malaysia (“RM”) denominated internal rate of return of 12.5% is not met by the Proposed IPO. This valuation 
adjustment will consist of SunCity either transferring additional SHH Shares to Greenwood on or prior to the 
completion of the Proposed IPO (“Proposed IPO Transfer Shares”) or the proceeds obtained from the sale of its 
SHH Shares pursuant to the Proposed IPO (“Proposed IPO Cash Transfer”) followed by a cash top up (“Proposed 
IPO Cash Top Up”), if required. As long as the Proposed IPO is completed by 31 January 2028, the Proposed 
IPO Transfer Shares and Proposed IPO Cash Transfer are collectively capped at 4.5% of the enlarged issued SHH 
Shares (on a fully converted basis) with the Proposed IPO Cash Top Up capped at United States Dollar (“USD”) 
10.0 million. If SHH does not complete the Proposed IPO by 31 January 2028, it will have an additional time 
period until the 8th anniversary of the Initial Closing, to complete the same. However, the Proposed IPO Transfer 
Shares, Proposed IPO Cash Transfer and Proposed IPO Cash Top Up ceilings will progressively increase during this 
period with the Proposed IPO Transfer Shares and Proposed IPO Cash Transfer collectively capped at 11.5% of the 
enlarged issued SHH Shares (on a fully converted basis) with the Proposed IPO Cash Top Up capped at USD50.0 
million.
 The Group has adopted the probability model in deriving the fair value of the derivative liabilities on exit clauses 
in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group. The key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the 
derivative liabilities on exit clauses in relation to the partial divestment of SHH Group include the probabilities 
of occurrence of the Proposed IPO, probabilities of achieving the desired Proposed IPO valuation, timing of the 
occurrence of Proposed IPO and discount rate of 9.2% (2022: 9.7%), which require significant judgements and 
estimates made by management.
(v)  Put option
 Put option represents the derivative attached to the Put Option Agreement (“POA”) entered between Sunway 
City Sdn. Bhd. (“Put Grantor”), Low Peng Kiat and CRSC Property Sdn. Bhd. (collectively, “Put Grantees”), 
in respect of Sunway Velocity Two Sdn. Bhd. (“Velocity Two”). Under the POA, for a period of 5 years from 
year 2025, the Put Grantor granted to Put Grantees the irrevocable right to require Put Grantor to purchase 
all of the Put Option Shares, representing 10% of the entire enlarged share capital of Velocity Two.
 The fair value of the put option is the difference between the strike price and the underlying price. The 
Group has adopted the Binomial option pricing model in deriving the fair value of the put option. The key 
assumptions in estimating the fair value include expected underlying share price, expected exercise put price, 
risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and expected volatility.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FINANCIALS FINANCIALSSunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023 Sunway Berhad • Integrated Annual Report 2023
28. OTHER INVESTMENTS (CONTD.)
(a)  The equity securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial 
Instruments.
 Except for equity securities which are not held for trading, for which the Group has irrevocably elected at initial recognition 
to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income. These are strategic investments for which the Group 
considers this classification to be appropriate and relevant.
(b)  Fair value of quoted ordinary shares in Malaysia was determined by reference to the exchange quoted market prices at 
the close of the business on the reporting date. The fair value of quoted ordinary shares of the Group was categorised as 
Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
(c)  The investments in funds are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 
Financial Instruments. Unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference shares and investments in funds of the Group 
are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of unquoted ordinary shares, unquoted preference 
shares and investments in funds of the Group are estimated based on adjusted transacted price. The movement in other 
investments categorised as Level 3 during the financial year includes net disposals amounted to RM39,513,000 (2022: 
RM8,074,000). 
 The key input to the valuation of the other investments is the adjusted transaction price paid. Significant increase/
(decrease) in estimated adjusted transaction price paid in isolation would result in a significant higher/(lower) fair value 
of the other investments.
(d)  The corporate memberships, unquoted loan stocks and unquoted corporate bonds are classified as financial assets at 
fair value through profit or loss pursuant to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The fair value of corporate memberships, 
unquoted loan stocks and unquoted corporate bonds of the Group and of the Company is categorised as Level 2 in the 
fair value hierarchy. The fair value measurements of unquoted corporate bonds are based on indicative prices from an 
accredited bond pricing agency while the fair value measurements of corporate memberships and unquoted loan stocks 
are based on market prices of similar instruments. 
(e)  Sensitivity analysis of quoted ordinary shares
 A change of 5% in stock indices, assuming all other variables constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in 
the fair value reserve in equity of the Group to be higher/(lower) by RM14,360,000 (2022: RM14,621,000), arising as 
a result of higher/(lower) fair value gains on quoted equity securities classified at fair value through other comprehensive 
income.
(f)  There is no transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.
29. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS
 All items of biological assets are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, biological assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
 Biological assets consist of animals in petting zoos operated by subsidiaries.
 During the financial year, the Group made cash payments of RM205,000 (2022: RM374,000) to purchase biological assets.
 Depreciation of biological assets is provided for on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each asset to its residual value 
over the estimated biological life, at an annual rate of 20%. Depreciation charge of biological assets recognised during the 
current financial year amounted to RM166,000 (2022: RM100,000).

(a)  Property development contracts
 Property development contracts represent the timing differences in revenue recognition and the milestone billings. The 
milestone billings are structured and/or negotiated with customers to reflect physical completion of the contracts.
 Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to economic benefits become unconditional. This usually 
occurs when the Group issues billing to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when performance 
obligations are satisfied.
 The Group’s contract assets and contract liabilities relating to the sale of properties at the end of the reporting period 
are as follows:
 Group 
 2023

(b)  The amount of RM7,871,000 (2022: RM7,258,000) recognised in contract liabilities at the beginning of the financial 
year has been recognised as revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.

(a)  Included in amounts due from joint ventures is an amount of RM1,161,757,000 (2022: RM1,487,456,000), 
which bears interest at rates ranging from 4.70% to 6.25% (2022: 4.41% to 7.40%) per annum. Of this amount, 
RM34,658,000 (2022: RM557,017,000) is secured by way of debentures over all the assets of the joint ventures.
 Included in amounts due to joint ventures is an amount of RM265,645,000 (2022: RM57,072,000), which bears 
interest at rates ranging from 3.05% to 5.44% (2022: 2.55% to 3.70%) per annum.
 The non-current amounts due from joint ventures are amounts, which are not expected to be repayable within the next 
twelve months in cash and cash equivalents, while the current amounts due from joint ventures are repayable within the 
next twelve months in cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of non-current amounts due from joint ventures 
approximate their fair values as their interest rates are priced at reasonable approximation of the market interest rates as 
at the end of the reporting period.
(b)  Interest bearing amounts due from/(to) joint ventures are at fixed rates except for an amount due to a joint venture of 
RM205,146,000, which is at variable rate. 
 Sensitivity analysis for fixed rate amounts due from/(to) joint ventures at the end of the reporting period is not presented 
as it is not affected by changes in interest rates. 
 For variable rate amount due to a joint venture, a change of 25 basis points in interest rates, assuming all other variables 
remained constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the profit net of tax of the Group to be lower/(higher) 
by RM390,000 (2022: Nil).

(d)  The Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the floating rate interest payable on some of its 
borrowings. The contracts entitle the Group to pay interest at fixed rates on notional principal amounts and oblige it 
to receive interest at floating rates on the same amounts. Under the swaps, the Group agrees with the other parties to 
exchange, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed 
notional principal amounts.
(e)  The Group also entered into cross currency swap contracts to manage its exposure in foreign currency risk arising from 
foreign currency borrowings as well as to minimise the interest cost.

 The fair value of borrowings obligations is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, which is estimated based 
on expected future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest as at the end of the reporting period. There is no 
transfer between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.
 Fair values of the borrowings are estimated by discounting future contracted cash flows at the current market interest 
rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

 The amount due to a related party is unsecured, non-interest bearing and payable based on credit terms granted to the 
Group. The relationship with the above related party is as disclosed in Note 49 to the financial statements.
(c)  Included in non-current payables of the Group is a total amount of RM103,284,000 (2022: RM146,247,000) pertaining 
to land entitlement payments, which will be paid upon completion of projects. The amount consists of RM14,514,000 
(2022: RM39,227,000) due to Bukit Lenang Development Sdn. Bhd. by Sunway City (JB) Sdn. Bhd., Nil (2022: 
RM21,883,000) due to Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Selangor by Sunway PKNS Sdn. Bhd. and RM88,770,000 
(2022: RM85,137,000) due to Meraki Land Sdn. Bhd. by Sunway Flora Sdn. Bhd..
(d)  Included in current payables of the Group is an amount of RM85,137,000 (2022: RM115,785,000) estimated to be 
due to Fawanis Sdn. Bhd. as its joint venture entitlement, which is unsecured, non-interest bearing and term of payment 
as stipulated in the Amended Joint Venture Agreement dated 22 February 2011.
(e)  Deferred income of the Group is mainly rental received in advance.
(f)  Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group and the Company to make specified payments to 
reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs when a specified debtor fails to make payments as and when they fall due.
 Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is 
initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with 
the expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 Financial Instruments and the amount initially recognised less cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
where appropriate.
 The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the 
contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the 
estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.
 Financial guarantee contracts are subject to forward looking expected credit loss model based on the general approach 
within MFRS 9 as disclosed in Note 25(d) to the financial statements.
 The Group and the Company assume that there is a significant increase in credit risk, when the financial positions of the 
subsidiaries and joint ventures deteriorate significantly. The Group and the Company consider a financial guarantee to 
be credit impaired when:
(i)  the joint ventures or subsidiaries are unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the bank in full; or
(ii)  the joint ventures or subsidiaries are continuously loss making and are having deficit shareholders’ funds.

37.  OTHER PAYABLES (CONTD.) 
(h)  Included in non-current payables of the Group is a shareholder loan advanced by non-controlling interests of a subsidiary 
amounted to RM43,929,000 (2022: RM41,611,000), which bears interest at variable rates ranging from 5.33% to 
5.62% (2022: 4.44% to 5.33%) per annum. A change of 25 basis points in interest rates, assuming all other variables 
remained constant, at the end of the reporting period would result in the profit net of tax of the Group to be lower/(higher) 
by RM83,000 (2022: RM79,000).  
(i)  Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities
 The table below details changes in the Group’s liabilities arising from financing activities, including both cash and non-
cash changes. Liabilities arising from financing activities are those for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will

38. HIRE PURCHASE AND LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTD.)
(a)  The hire purchase and lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid 
at the commencement date.
 After initial recognition, hire purchase and lease liabilities are measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect 
interest on the hire purchase and lease liabilities, reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made and 
remeasuring the carrying amounts to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.
 The corresponding right-of-use assets of the hire purchase and lease liabilities are presented as property, plant and 
equipment as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.
 Variable lease payments, lease payments associated with short term leases and low value assets
 Certain property leases of the Group as a lessee contain variable payment terms that are linked to sales or profits 
generated by the lessee in relation to the properties. 
 The Group recognises these variable lease payments when the condition that triggers those payments occur while lease 
payments associated with short term leases (leases with lease term of 12 months or less) and low value assets (leases 
for which the underlying asset is RM20,000 and below) are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The 
variable lease payments and lease payments associated with short term leases and low value assets are recognised in 
profit or loss as rental expenses as disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.
 Extension and termination options
 Extension and termination options are included in certain property leases of the Group, which are negotiated for purposes 
such as providing operational flexibility to the Group. The extension and termination options are mainly exercisable by 
the Group and not by the respective lessors.
 The Group determines the lease term of a lease as the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered 
by an option to extend or to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the relevant options. 
Management has considered the relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group 
to either exercise the option to extend the lease, or to exercise the option to terminate the lease. Any differences in 
expectations from the original estimates would impact the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities of the Group.
 During the current financial year, the Group and the Company had reassessed the lease terms of certain property leases 
in relation to the likelihood of exercising the extension options, taking into consideration the current relevant facts and 
circumstances. There were also modifications on the terms and conditions of certain property leases of the Group and of 
the Company during the current financial year. 
 The effects of the lease reassessments and modifications of the Group during the current financial year was an increase 
in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM433,000 and RM843,000 respectively (2022: a decrease 
in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM3,349,000 and RM2,368,000 respectively) as disclosed in 
Note 15 to the financial statements as well as a net gain on reassessments and modifications of leases recognised in 
profit or loss of RM410,000 (2022: RM981,000).
 The effects of the lease reassessments and modifications of the Company during the current financial year was a 
corresponding decrease in both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM138,000 (2022: A corresponding increase 
in both lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of RM765,000) as disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.

44. RESERVES (CONTD.)
 The natures of each category of reserves are as follows:
(a) Capital reserve
 Capital reserve represents the Group’s accretion in the value of investments in subsidiaries arising from internal 
restructuring, which includes the redemption of cumulative redeemable preference shares.
(b) Statutory reserve
 Statutory reserve represents the 10% of accumulated gains recognised in the People’s Republic of China subsidiaries’ 
income statement, which is not distributable.
 According to the Articles of Association of the subsidiaries, when distributing net profit of each financial year, the 
subsidiaries shall set aside 10% of its after tax profits for the statutory common reserve fund (except where the fund has 
reached 50% of the subsidiaries’ registered capital). These reserves cannot be used for purposes other than those for 
which they are created and are not distributable as cash dividends.
(c) Revaluation reserve
 Revaluation reserve represents revaluation adjustment arising from transfer of owner-occupied property to investment 
property.
(d) Cash flow hedge reserve
 Cash flow hedge reserve represents the net gains or losses, net of tax, on effective cash flow hedging instruments that 
will be recycled to the profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. 
(e) Fair value reserve
 The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value through other comprehensive income 
investment held until the investment is derecognised. 
(f) Furniture, fittings and equipment reserve
 In accordance with the Hotel Master Lease Agreement, the Group must set aside in the furniture, fittings and equipment 
(“FF&E”) reserve during each financial year, an amount equivalent to 2.5% of the anticipated revenue. The FF&E reserve 
must be used and disbursed only in accordance with the agreed FF&E Plan. 
(g) Foreign currency translation reserve
 The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record foreign currency exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from that of the 
presentation currency of the Group. It is also used to record the exchange differences arising from monetary items, which 
form part of the net investment of the Group in foreign operations, where the monetary item is denominated in either the 
functional currency of the reporting entity or the foreign operation.
45. MERGER EXERCISE
 On 18 August 2011, the Company acquired the entire businesses and undertakings, including all assets and liabilities of 
Sunway Holdings Sdn. Bhd. and Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (collectively known as the “Merged Entities”).
 The consideration for the acquisition of the Merged Entities was satisfied via the payment of RM904.7 million cash and the 
issuance of 1,292.5 million new ordinary shares of RM1.00 each at an issue price of RM2.80 each together with 258.5 
million free warrants.
 The issuance of the new ordinary shares by the Company in the previous financial years to effect the above transaction 
has been reflected in the share capital of the Company as shown in Note 43 to the financial statements. As the Merged 
Entities were under common control before and after the merger, the Group and the Company applied the merger method of 
accounting. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements have been accounted for as if the merger had occurred from 
the date when these entities were under common control.
46. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS

 The Group entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements on properties with third parties. The commercial 
properties combined leases of land and buildings. At the inception of the lease, it was not possible to obtain a reliable estimate 
of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between the land and the buildings. Therefore, the Group evaluated based on 
terms and conditions of the arrangement, whether the land and the buildings were clearly operating leases or finance leases.

Claim by a third party  164,378  164,378
 Claim by a third party represents proportionate share of contingent liability in relation to a material litigation of Sunway 
REIT, a 40.89% owned associate of the Group, with Metroplex Holdings Sdn. Bhd. (“Metroplex”).
 On 28 September 2015, Metroplex filed writ of summons and a statement of claim against Sunway REIT to claim, 
amongst others, damages for various chattels and movable items (e.g. furniture and office equipment, decorations, 
cutlery, kitchen equipment, bar equipment, concierge and reception tables, blinds and curtains), which were allegedly 
acquired and owned by Metroplex but not removed by Metroplex when Sunway REIT took possession of the hotel at 
Sunway Putra on 27 September 2011. Metroplex has in its statement of claim alleged that the various chattels and 
movable items were worth in excess of RM80 million as at September 2011. 
 On 3 November 2017, the High Court allowed Metroplex’s claim on liability in which the damages to be awarded to 
Metroplex shall be assessed (“High Court’s Decision”).
 Subsequently, Sunway REIT appealed to the Court of Appeal against the High Court’s Decision on 6 November 2017. 
The Court of Appeal allowed Sunway REIT’s appeal and the High Court’s Decision was set aside on 22 January 2019 
(“Court of Appeal’s Decision”).
 On 20 February 2019, Metroplex filed motion for leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the Court of Appeal’s 
Decision (“Motion”). The Motion was allowed on 25 November 2019. Subsequently, Metroplex filed notice of appeal to 
appeal against the Court of Appeal’s Decision on 2 December 2019 (“Appeal”). The hearing for the Appeal was fixed on 
31 March 2021.
 On 31 March 2021, the Federal Court allowed Metroplex’s appeal by setting aside the Court of Appeal’s Decision, 
restoring the High Court’s Decision and ordered the assessment of damages against Sunway REIT to proceed before 
the High Court (“Assessment”). In Metroplex’s claim, Metroplex is claiming for various chattels and movable items 
amounting to approximately RM402 million. However, Sunway REIT is strenuously objecting to the amount claimed as 
being overly excessive and has appointed subject matter experts to dispute the quantum of claim.
 The trial for the said Assessment was held on 4, 5, 6, 12 and 13 January 2023. Upon conclusion of the trial, the High 
Court judge directed Sunway REIT and Metroplex to appear before the High Court for oral submission on 9 and 15 May 
2023. After hearing oral submissions by both parties, the Judge then proceeded to fix the date for the decision to be 
delivered. At this stage, the financial impact cannot be determined pending the decision of the High Court, which has 
been adjourned to 30 May 2024.
 In accordance with MFRS 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, the Group discloses the share 
of associate’s contingent liabilities relating to this legal case as there is a present obligation that arose from past event, 
although the amount of obligation could not be measured with sufficient reliability at this juncture.
(b) Material outstanding litigations
(i)  On 4 September 2008, the solicitors of Sunway Construction Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCon”) had been served with a 
Statement of Claim (“Statement of Claim”) by Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (“Claimant”). 
 Pursuant to an agreement signed between SunCon and the National Highway Authority of India for the rehabilitation 
and upgrading of NH-25 to a four-lane configuration in the state of Uttar Pradesh being a part of the East-West 
Corridor Project, SunCon had entered into a work order with the Claimant for the upgrading and rehabilitation of 
the stretch of NH-25 from 143.6 km to 170.0 km, of which the Claimant has provided two bank guarantees (“Bank 
Guarantees”) to SunCon.

48. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTD.)
(b) Material outstanding litigations (contd.)
(i) (contd.)
 The Claimant has failed to carry out its obligations under the work order and SunCon has terminated the work order 
and cashed the Bank Guarantees. The Claimant had filed an application in the Supreme Court of India for the 
appointment of an arbitrator to arbitrate upon the disputes between the parties. The Supreme Court had appointed 
the late Mr. H.L. Agarwal as the sole arbitrator.
 The Statement of Claim was raised in respect of various claims and the total amount claimed is Rs.891.5 million 
(approximately equivalent to RM49.2 million) in addition to interest and cost.
 In the counterclaim, SunCon is seeking for Rs.781.4 million (approximately equivalent to RM43.1 million) for 
inter alia, additional costs incurred by SunCon to complete the works, recovery of mobilisation advance and 
interest charges, loss of reputation and loss of profits.
 On 11 January 2013, the arbitrator that presided over the case passed away and 75 hearings had been held.
 SunCon was notified by its solicitors that an arbitration petition has been filed by the Claimant on 7 January 2016 
in the Supreme Court of India for the appointment of a new arbitrator. The Supreme Court of India by an order 
dated 5 January 2017 appointed Hon’ble Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen (a former Judge of the Supreme Court of 
India) as arbitrator. The first hearing before Mr. Justice Vikramajit Sen was held on 24 February 2017 and cross 
examination has been completed on 7 October 2017.  
 The Arbitrator published his award on 9 April 2019 and awarded the Claimant Rs.128.4 million (approximately 
equivalent to RM7.1 million). 
 SunCon has filed an appeal with the High Court of New Delhi in early July 2019 to set aside the arbitral award. 
The Claimant has also filed an execution application against SunCon for enforcement of the arbitral award. 
 On 10 February 2020, the Honorable Court has directed SunCon to deposit, on a without prejudice basis, the 
decretal amount with interest with the Registrar General of the High Court of Delhi. SunCon has deposited Rs.135.7 
million (approximately equivalent to RM7.5 million) on 26 February 2020 and the amount has been fully provided 
in the accounts on prudence grounds. Subject to compliance of the said direction, the Honorable Court has stayed 
the Arbitral Award dated 9 April 2019. 
 On 4 March 2020, the Claimant filed an application in the High Court of Delhi to permit the Claimant to withdraw 
the decretal amount deposited by SunCon.
 On 27 August 2020, the Court directed the release of Rs.67.2 million (approximately equivalent to RM3.7 million) 
on the basis of a corporate guarantee to be furnished by Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd. The balance is to be 
released subject to furnishing of a bank guarantee. On 3 November 2020, the Court placed on record the corporate 
guarantee issued on 21 September 2020 and directed the registry to release the amount in terms of the Court 
order. On 18 November 2020, the Claimant withdrew their application for withdrawal without a bank guarantee 
and it has been dismissed accordingly.
 Matter was adjourned several times. On 20 July 2023, Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd filed an application for 
release of corporate guarantee and discharge itself from all obligations under the corporate guarantee. Application 
was heard on 31 July 2023 and is re-notified for arguments on 29 August 2023 and adjourned to 23 November 
2023.
 On 20 December 2023, SunCon filed a contempt application against the Claimant and Srei Infrastructure Finance 
Ltd (“Respondents”). The application was listed on 22 December 2023 and the Court has duly issued notice to 
the Respondents. On 23 January 2024, the Claimant sought an adjournment of two weeks to file their reply which 
was allowed. The matter came up on 29 February 2024 and is listed for 14 May 2024.
48. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTD.)
(b) Material outstanding litigations (contd.)
(ii) PNSB Acmar Sdn. Bhd. (“Plaintiff”) has on 14 November 2019 served a Writ of Summon and a Statement of 
Claim both dated 8 November 2019 on Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (“Prasarana”) (1st Defendant) and Sunway 
Construction Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCon”) (2nd Defendant).
 The Plaintiff is claiming that all the construction works in relation to the project known as “Construction and 
Completion of Light Rail Transit Line 3 (LRT3) from Bandar Utama to Johan Setia” (“Project”) and the structures 
such as the Project’s poles, bars, and LRT stations had trespassed and/or encroached into the Plaintiff’s own 
development project area and has resulted in losses and damages towards the Plaintiff.
 Prasarana is the owner of the Project and SunCon is the awarded Works Package Contractor for the contract known 
as “Contract No. Prasarana/GSC/CTT/2.06080/2017: Construction and Completion of Guideway, Stations Iconic 
Bridge, Park and Rides, Ancillary Buildings and other Associated Works for Package GS07-08 for Light Rail Transit 
3 (LRT3) from Bandar Utama to Johan Setia” in relation to the Project.
 The Plaintiff filed a claim for trespass and encroachment, negligence, private and public nuisance against the 
Defendants for the sum of RM711,367,434.46. SunCon filed its Defence on 2 January 2020 disputing the Plaintiff’s 
claim. The Plaintiff amended its Statement of Claim and reduced its claim to the sum of RM643,851,825.01 in 
the Amended Statement of Claim dated 21 July 2021.
 On 27 July 2021, SunCon issued a Third Party Notice dated 24 July 2021 to Setia Utama LRT 3 Sdn. Bhd. (“Third 
Party”) and claimed against the Third Party for indemnity and/or contribution for any sum that may be due from 
SunCon to the Plaintiff. On 3 September 2021, the Third Party issued its Defence and Counterclaim.
 On 1 April 2022, the matter was transferred to the Shah Alam High Court (Construction Division) and a new suit 
number of BA-22C-18-05/2022 was assigned to the matter.
 The matter is currently fixed for case management on 20 March 2024. The trial dates have been scheduled from 
12 August 2024 to 15 August 2024 and 26 August 2024 to 29 August 2024.
(iii)  SunCon was awarded a contract for the execution of the rehabilitation and upgrading of km 406 to km 449.15 
of highway NH-76 in the State of Rajasthan, India to four-lane configuration (“NH-76 Highway Project”) by the 
National Highways Authority (“NHA”) in 2005. SunCon commenced 7 separate arbitration proceedings against 
NHA on various disputes arising from the NH-76 Highway Project.
 In November 2012, SunCon claimed against NHA for the loss and expenses incurred during the extended project 
year which was due to NHA’s delay. The Arbitral Tribunal had, via an award dated 29 April 2014, awarded SunCon 
a sum of Rs.310.3 million (approximately equivalent to RM17.1 million).

48. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONTD.)
(b) Material outstanding litigations (contd.)
(iii) (contd.)
 NHA appealed against the Arbitral Tribunal’s award to the High Court. Matter was adjourned several times.
 On 3 June 2020, SunCon has issued a letter to NHA with the intention to explore the possibility of an amicable 
resolution of the disputes with NHA through the mechanism of Conciliation Committee of Independent Experts 
(“CCIE”). After a series of discussion, no amicable settlement ensued between the parties. The next hearing is 
scheduled for 21 February 2024.
 On 15 July 2023, the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, India has launched the Vivad se Vishwas - II 
(Contractual Disputes) Scheme vide the Office Memorandum. This scheme is implemented by the Government of 
India as a one-time settlement scheme to clear the old litigation cases.
 The settlement offer under the scheme was accepted by both parties on 18 December 2023 and NHA had agreed 
to repay 65% of the award, which amounted to approximately Rs.372.9 million (approximately equivalent to 
RM20.8 million). This amount of income arising from settlement scheme has been recognised in the financial 
statement of the Group as at 31 December 2023 as the realisation of income is virtually certain upon acceptance 
of the settlement amount as disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.
 On 9 January 2024, by way of application, NHA sought leave to withdraw its appeal stating that the parties 
had settled their disputes under the “Vivad se Vishwas II” scheme. NHA has agreed to pay Rs.375.3 million 
(approximately equivalent to RM21.3 million) inclusive of taxes, to SunCon as full and final settlement of all the 
claims and disputes pertaining to the contract. The Court allowed NHA’s application and stood disposed of as 
withdrawn. The scheduled hearing date of 21 February 2024 was cancelled. Subsequently, SunCon had received 
the settlement amount on 1 March 2024.

the parties sharing control.
 The Group recognises its direct right and share of any jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint 
operations in accordance with the MFRS applicable to the respective assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
 On 6 October 2023, the Group, via Sunway Construction Sdn. Bhd. has entered into an agreement with Kajima (Malaysia)

(a) Acquisition of remaining stakes in Sunway Iskandar Development Sdn. Bhd. ("SIDSB"), which was previously a joint venture of 
the Group
 On 14 August 2023, Sunway City Sdn. Bhd. (“SunCity”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, had entered into a 
Share Transactions Agreement with Iskandar Asset Sdn. Bhd. ("IASB") and SIDSB, a joint venture of the Group, for the 
following purposes:

53. ADOPTION OF MFRSS AND AMENDMENTS TO MFRSS (CONTD.)
(a) New MFRSs adopted during the financial year (contd.)
 MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
 MFRS 17 establishes the principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts 
and supersedes MFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. 
 MFRS 17 outlines three measurement approaches for different types of insurance contracts - general measurement model, 
premium allocation approach and variable fee approach. The general measurement model uses current assumptions to 
estimate the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows and it explicitly measures the cost of that uncertainty. 
It takes into account market interest rates and the impact of options and guarantees of policyholders. The general 
measurement model is simplified if certain criteria are met by measuring the liability for remaining coverage using 
the premium allocation approach. Variable fee approach is applicable for insurance contracts with direct participation 
features.
 The Group and the Company do not have any contracts that meet the definition of an insurance contract under MFRS 
17, except for guaranteed bank facilities provided to joint ventures and corporate guarantee provided to subsidiaries, 
which are financial guarantee contracts that the Group and the Company had previously explicitly asserted under MFRS 
4 and performance guarantee contracts. The expected future cash outflows of the performance guarantee contracts 
are negligible. Consequently, the Group is of the view that the carrying amount of the performance guarantee contract 
liabilities are not material, and hence it is not accounted for. The Group and the Company made an irrevocable choice 
to apply MFRS 9 Financial Instruments on a contract-by-contract basis to these financial guarantee contracts as at the 
date of transition to MFRS 17 retrospectively.
 The effects of the adoption are disclosed in Note 54 to the financial statements.
(b) New MFRSs that have been issued, but only effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024
 The Standards that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to adopt these Standards, if applicable, when 
they become effective.
Title Effective Date
Amendments to MFRS 101 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current 1 January 2024
Amendments to MFRS 101 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants 1 January 2024
Amendments to MFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback 1 January 2024
Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7 Supplier Finance Arrangements 1 January 2024
Amendments to MFRS 121 Lack of Exchangeability 1 January 2025
Amendments to MFRS 10 and MFRS 128 Sale or Contribution of Assets  
between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
Deferred
  
 The Group and the Company are in the process of assessing the impact of implementing these Standards, since the 
effects would only be observable for the future financial years.

54. FINANCIAL EFFECTS ON TRANSITION TO MFRS 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS
 The Group and the Company had previously designated its financial guarantee contracts given to third parties and 
financial institutions in respect of trade contracts and credit facilities as insurance contracts as defined in MFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts. At the transition date to MFRS 17, an entity which had previously applied MFRS 4 to its financial 
guarantee contracts is given the irrevocable choice to apply either MFRS 17 or MFRS 9 Financial Instruments to such 
insurance contracts on a contract-by-contract basis. The Group and the Company have elected to apply MFRS 9 on 1 
January 2023 retrospectively.
 An explanation on the impact arising from the change in accounting policy on the financial position and financial 
performance of the Group and of the Company is set out as follows:

NOTES:
(1) The 14th Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) will be conducted virtually through live streaming and online remote voting using Remote Participation and Electronic 
Voting (“RPEV”) facilities provided by the appointed Poll Administrator for the AGM, Boardroom Share Registrars Sdn Bhd (“Boardroom”).
 The Broadcast Venue is strictly for the purpose of complying with Section 327(2) of the Companies Act 2016 which requires the Chairperson of the Meeting to be 
at the main venue of the AGM. No shareholders/proxies/corporate representatives from the public shall be physically present at the Broadcast Venue on the day of the 
AGM. Shareholders who wish to participate, speak (in the form of real-time submission of typed texts) and vote remotely at the AGM will have to register via the link 
at https://meeting.boardroomlimited.my. Please refer to the Administrative Details for the 14th AGM for further information.
 Only shareholders whose names appear on the Record of Depositors as at 18 June 2024 will be entitled to participate at this AGM or appoint a proxy to participate 
on his/her behalf.
(2) A shareholder of the Company who is entitled to participate, speak and vote remotely at the AGM, may appoint more than 1 proxy to attend and vote instead of the 
shareholder at the AGM. A proxy needs not be a shareholder.
(3) Where a shareholder is an authorised nominee as defined under the Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991, it may appoint at least 1 proxy in respect 
of each securities account it holds in ordinary shares of the Company standing to the credit of the said securities account.
(4) Where a shareholder is an exempt authorised nominee which holds ordinary shares in the Company for multiple beneficial owners in 1 securities account (“omnibus 
account”), there is no limit to the number of proxies which the exempt authorised nominee may appoint in respect of each omnibus account it holds.
(5) Where a shareholder appoints more than 1 proxy, the appointment shall be invalid unless he/she specifies the proportions of his/her shareholdings to be represented 
by each proxy. A proxy appointed to participate, speak and vote at the AGM shall have the same rights as the shareholder to speak at the AGM.
(6) If a shareholder has appointed a proxy to attend a meeting and subsequently, the appointer decides to attend instead of the proxy, the appointer has to revoke the 
appointment of proxy in writing/email which must reach Boardroom not later than 24 hours before the Meeting. The appointed proxy shall therefore be null and void.
(7) The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointer or of his/her attorney duly authorised in writing, or if such appointer is a 
corporation, either under its common seal or the hand of its officer or attorney duly authorised.

next AGM, they will be paid as and when they are incurred. The Board opined that the payments to the NEDs are just and 
equitable taking into account their roles and responsibilities towards the Company and the services that they have rendered 
to the Company. 
 NEDs who are shareholders of the Company will abstain from voting on the aforesaid resolutions at the 14th AGM.
3. Ordinary Resolutions 3 to 6 - To re-elect Dato’ Sri Idris Jala, Tan Sri Datuk Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria, Datuk Tong Poh Keow and 
Datuk Mohd Anuar bin Taib as Directors of the Company 
 Clause 106(1) of the Company’s Constitution provides that one-third or the number nearest to one-third of the Directors of 
the Company (including Managing Director) for the time being shall retire by rotation at each AGM of the Company. Each 
Director shall retire from office once at least in each three years but shall be eligible for re-election. 
NOTICE OF 14TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
 Dato’ Sri Idris Jala, Tan Sri Datuk Dr. Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria and Datuk Tong Poh Keow being eligible, have offered 
themselves for re-election at the 14th AGM. 
 Clause 89 provides that any Director appointed shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall be eligible for re-election. 
Datuk Mohd Anuar bin Taib who was appointed on 7 July 2023 is standing for re-election as Director and being eligible, 
has offered himself for re-election.
 The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) has assessed the performance and contribution of the retiring 
Directors including their skills, experience, character, integrity, competency, commitment and contribution as well as the 
independence of the Independent Directors seeking for re-election at the 14th AGM. Based on the findings of the Board 
and Board Committee Evaluation for the financial year ended 2023, the performance and contribution of the retiring 
Directors were found to be satisfactory and they are competent and able to discharge their fiduciary duties as Directors of 
the Company. NRC is satisfied that the retiring Directors meet the fit and proper criteria as set out in the Fit and Proper 
Policy. The retiring NEDs also complied and satisfied the independence criteria as required by the Main Market Listing 
Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The retiring Directors do not have any conflict of interest or 
potential conflict of interest, including any interest in any competing business with the Company or its subsidiaries.
 Based on the above, the Board had endorsed the recommendation of the NRC to seek the shareholders’ approval for the 
re-election of the retiring Directors. All Directors standing for re-election have abstained from deliberations and decisions 
on their own eligibility to stand for re-election at the relevant NRC and Board Meetings. They will continue to abstain from 
voting on their own re-election at the 14th AGM.
 The profiles of Directors seeking for re-elections at the 14th AGM are set out in the Profile of the Board of Directors on pages 
116 to 127 of the Company’s Integrated Annual Report 2023.
4. Ordinary Resolution 7 – To re-appoint Messrs BDO PLT as Auditors of the Company for the financial year ending 31 December 2024 
and to authorise the Directors to fix their remuneration
 Based on the results of the External Auditors Evaluation for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and the Audit 
Committee’s recommendation, the Board had at its meeting held on 4 April 2024, approved the re-appointment of Messrs 
BDO PLT (“BDO”) as Auditors of the Company on the basis that BDO had satisfactorily performed their audit and that BDO 
had discharged their professional responsibilities in accordance with its rules on professional conduct and ethics and the 
By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conducts and Practice) issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.
 The Board was also satisfied that the provisions of non-audit services by BDO to the Company for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023 did not in any way impair their objectivity and independence as External Auditors of the Company.
(ii)  Special Business 
5. Ordinary Resolution 8 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Act
 The Company is always on the lookout for investment opportunities to enhance the earnings potential of the Company. If 
any investment opportunities involve issuance of new shares, the Directors, under present circumstances, would have to 
convene a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares even though the number involved may be less than 10% 
of the total number of issued shares of the Company.
 In order to avoid any delay and costs involved in convening a general meeting to approve such issuance of shares, it is 
thus considered appropriate that the Directors be empowered to issue new shares in the Company, up to an amount not 
exceeding in total 10% of the total number of issued shares of the Company at any time, for such purpose. This authority, 
unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the next AGM of the Company.
 
 The renewal of this mandate will provide flexibility to the Company for any potential fund raising activities, including but 
not limited to placement of shares, for purpose of funding current and/or future investments, working capital, acquisition, 
repayment of borrowings, operational expenditure and/or such other applications as they may in their absolute discretion 
deem fit.
