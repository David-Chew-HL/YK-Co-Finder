Pursuing significant 
global opportunities
Nutrition, Health and Wellness is our past, present  
and future, and within that frame we continue to set  
new priorities. Our innovation capabilities enable us  
to consistently meet the rising expectations of a 
growing population. Portfolio optimization over the 
past years allows us to focus our efforts on our proven 
brands. Our operational excellence enables us to 
dependably deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And 
we continue to do business in a way that creates shared 
value for both our shareholders and society. 
Encouraging balanced diets
Foods and beverages are major drivers of long-term 
health, and consumers increasingly recognize this. We 
will continue to develop nutritious products that support 
people’s well-being, and we believe that such products 
will see increased demand in the years to come. 
In fact, in 2023, we reconfirmed our ambition to 
prioritize the development of our more nutritious 
products. This entails launching new products and 
renovating existing ones. It involves expanding 
micronutrient fortification, growing our affordable 
offerings, reducing sugar and salt content, and 
increasing our use of plant-based ingredients in 
our recipes.
Dear fellow shareholders,
As the Good food, Good life company, Nestlé  
is proud to provide consumers with products 
they love and rely on. Even in the face of ongoing 
global challenges this past year, we stay true to 
our long-term ambitions and see a bright future 
with emerging opportunities.
Additionally, we are actively guiding people towards 
a more balanced diet by making the nutritional value 
of our portfolio more transparent. We are strengthening 
our responsible marketing of indulgent products, 
providing clear front-of-pack portion guidance, and 
engaging with and informing consumers through our 
various online communities around the world. 
Supporting healthy aging
Nestlé’s food and beverage portfolio caters to people 
at each stage of their life. It starts with the first 
1000 days and continues into adulthood and old age. 
With a rapidly aging global population, we see an 
opportunity to provide products that can support the 
nutrition, health and wellness of older people. We can 
help boost their energy levels, enhance their cognitive 
health, support their mobility, and improve their general 
physical and mental health. 
We already offer several Nestlé Health Science and 
dairy products that are specifically targeted to seniors. 
Take, for example, successful brands like Boost, Pure 
Encapsulations or Molico. With our capabilities, we 
believe that we can leverage this trend across all of our 
categories to further grow. 
Investing in innovation  
We are investing in our future through innovation 
and entrepreneurship. Through our main research 
center in Switzerland and 23 sites globally, and with 
an industry-leading R&D budget, we develop products 
tailored to the diverse needs of people and pets while 
reducing our environmental footprint. Experts at our 
newly inaugurated Institute of Agricultural Sciences, 
for example, develop solutions in the areas of plant 
science, agricultural systems and dairy livestock.  
This is in addition to our four other research institutes 
looking at health sciences, food sciences, food safety 
and packaging. 
Digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), 
are supporting sharper decision-making and increased 
speed across the entire company. From procurement to 
e-commerce, digital analytics facilitate efficiency and

effectiveness. Data science and AI increasingly support 
us with innovation by revealing and predicting consumer 
demands, while also helping us bring new products to 
market faster.
Creating Shared Value
Creating Shared Value is how we do business at Nestlé, 
generating value not only for our shareholders but also 
for society. Nestlé’s long-term success is supported  
by this approach.
An example of this is Nestlé’s efforts to advance 
regenerative food production by helping protect, renew 
and restore natural resources. To that end, we are 
supporting farmers and strengthening their communities. 
We are delivering on our commitments in a way that 
appeals to consumers’ increased expectations.
Remaining dedicated and dependable
Every year, our people show us how much can be 
achieved when we steadfastly pursue opportunities. We 
know that we do not have all the answers, but with our 
Paul Bulcke
Chairman
U. Mark Schneider
Chief Executive Officer
global mindset combined with our expert knowledge of 
local consumers and markets, we are confident we can 
deliver on our ambition and our commitments. 
People all over the world rely on Nestlé for good food  
and beverages. Our proven value creation model allows 
us to invest, innovate and grow even in challenging 
times, and makes us dependable for our shareholders 
and other stakeholders. We are grateful for the support 
of our employees, business partners, consumers and 
communities. And we thank you, our shareholders, for 
your continued trust.

Our purpose is unlocking the power of food to enhance 
quality of life for everyone, today and for generations 
to come. To achieve this, we pursue growth through 
rapid innovation, operational efficiency, and disciplined 
resource and capital allocation. 
Our portfolio is diversified, both in terms of geography 
and category. We have products for people at all life 
stages that can be consumed as part of a balanced 
diet. We want to contribute to people’s health through 
nutrition and aim to help people of all ages live better. 
Our innovation capabilities ensure we deliver products 
that meet consumer needs and preferences, and are 
good for the planet. Through digital technologies, we 
are able to be more agile and make better and faster 
decisions. 
Driving organic sales growth 
Organic sales growth is key to our growth ambition.  
Our portfolio is geared to deliver sustained mid single-
digit organic sales growth based on investment in 
attractive categories and regions, impactful innovation 
and execution discipline. Our knowledge of local 
consumers coupled with our scientific and technological 
expertise help us deliver innovations that support 
business growth, while meeting consumer needs.  
We also see many opportunities for growth through 
cross-fertilization between categories and geographies. 
In addition to core innovation activities focused on 
food safety, taste, nutrition and sustainability, we have 
intensified research in high-growth categories, such as 
early-life and therapeutic nutrition, alternative proteins, 
and coffee and systems technology. Ecosystem building 
and business model innovation are also increasingly  
a focus of our categories.
Alongside innovation, we continue to optimize our 
portfolio to focus on stronger brands and products.
Innovating across life stages and health needs
The foods and beverages people consume play a pivotal 
role in their overall health. From pre-conception to early 
life, through to childhood, adulthood and old age, we aim 
to meet people’s nutritional and health needs throughout 
their lives. 
Nestlé has deep roots in infant nutrition. For years, 
we have researched the composition of nutrients 
and bioactives present in breastmilk as well as the 
role of probiotics in nutrition and health. Exploring 
the interaction between these different components, 
Nestlé experts discovered a proprietary probiotic strain, 
B. infantis, that unlocks beneficial aspects of six human 
milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). This led to the launch in 
2023 of our proprietary blend, Sinergity, for use in infant 
formulas to support immunity and gut health. 
As we continue our tradition of supporting children’s 
health, we also need to consider an aging population 
that is living longer. Under our R+D Accelerator initiative, 
we developed the Nestlé Goodnes range of products in 
2023 to support healthy aging. It helps optimize people’s 
energy levels, restore their sleep quality and improve 
their focus through patented nutritional blends. The 
products were piloted in France, Singapore and the UK. 
Additionally, we launched the Nestlé N3 range in China 
that helps people maintain their overall health and well-
being as they age. 
Expanding alternative proteins
In 2023, we added to our plant-based portfolio by 
launching a range of vegan alternatives to fish filets, 
nuggets and fingers that stand out for their strong 
nutrition credentials, as well as their great taste and 
texture that is close to white fish. Garden Gourmet 
launched Marine-Style Crispy Filet and Marine-Style 
Crispy Nuggets in Europe, and Harvest Gourmet launched 
Crispy Fish-Free Fingers in Asia.
We also continued to explore new concepts for dairy 
alternatives. Made with a blend of oat and fava, the new 
natural bliss beverages are a good source of high-quality 
protein. Our teams chose fava beans because of their 
many health benefits and good taste. 
In addition, we combined the goodness of milk with  
plant-based ingredients in our new Nido Milk & Soya  
instant powder launched in Central and West Africa and  
Nestlé is exploring 
emerging technologies 
like animal-free dairy 
beverages made with 
precision fermentation, 
which led to a pilot  
for Cowabunga in  
the United States.

in our Bear Brand Doble Protein powdered beverage 
piloted in the Philippines. Both products are highly 
nutritious and affordable. 
Making innovation faster and more efficient
We are using AI and data science to complement our 
R&D capabilities and manage complexities during 
innovation. Our new recipe optimization tool uses 
advanced algorithms to help product developers better 
manage tradeoffs between ingredients, nutrition, cost and 
sustainability, while still meeting consumer expectations. 
In the development of the new Nescafé Dolce Gusto Neo 
coffee system, our experts optimized the manufacturing 
process through virtual simulations before applying 
technical settings on the physical machine. This helped 
them make quick and efficient decisions to manage 
the complex interaction between coffee, paper packaging 
material and the machine to ensure the perfect coffee cup 
for consumers.
Improving efficiency with digital technologies
Digitalization is enabling better and faster decision-
making, in addition to improving cost efficiencies.  
We are harmonizing our data framework to be able  
to take advantage of different technologies, like AI. 
The Nestlé Supplier Portal, a global digital collaboration 
platform, supports quality document management, 
sustainability data collection and supplier performance 
management. With over 7000 active suppliers in over 
40 markets, it covers almost three-quarters of our direct 
material spend. 
Leveraging always-on analytics 
We are responding to fast-changing consumer needs 
in real time, using data to streamline our business 
processes. Our strategic procurement decisions are 
more informed, as we increasingly leverage advanced 
statistical modeling with machine learning and 
automated price-trend analytics. And by deploying new 
marketing analytics capabilities at scale, we are building 
data foundation pipelines that automatically refresh our 
marketing effectiveness models for faster and smarter 
investment decisions.
In 2023, we spent 68% of our media budget digitally 
and acquired 308 million first-party data records. We are 
on track to meet our 2025 goals of 70% and 400 million 
respectively. Using AI, this data helps our brands reach 
target audiences more efficiently and deliver more 
relevant, personalized messages online. 
Accelerating e-commerce
Our ambition for 2025 is that a quarter of our sales 
come from e-commerce. This will have a significant 
impact on all markets, brands and roles. To support 
this, we launched an e-commerce academy that offers 
personalized learning paths. Over 1500 employees were 
trained and certified in 2023.
We have also launched our own eB2B platforms in key 
markets such as Brazil, India, Mexico and Vietnam, and 
have partnered with other leading platforms, such as 
the eB2B platform BEES.
Grown by only 
59 Colombian 
farmers and 
developed to create 
a unique tasting 
experience, the new

20 years of expertise.

The N3 milk products are the result of 
development work done by experts at R&D 
Nutrition, R&D Singapore, R&D Beijing and 
Nestlé Research.
Thanks to our strong global 
capabilities, we continue to develop 
exciting innovations that can be 
applied across different products, 
brands and categories. 
One of our latest unique science-
based innovations is Nestlé N3 milk, 
which offers new nutritional benefits. 
Made from cow’s milk, it has all the 
essential nutrients found in milk, 
including proteins, vitamins and 
minerals. In addition, it also contains 
beneficial prebiotic fibers and has 
a low lactose content and over 15% 
fewer calories.
Using a proprietary technology, we 
use specialized enzymes to break 
down lactose, a sugar found in cow’s 
milk, while generating prebiotic fibers. 
Clinical studies showed that the 
fibers promote the growth of multiple 
types of bifidobacteria, delivering gut 
microbiome benefits in healthy adults.
N3 milk was first introduced in 2023, 
in a range of powdered dairy products 
in China, tailored to meet the dietary 
needs of local consumers. The N3 
range includes a full cream and a 
skimmed milk product, both high 
in protein and perfect for the whole 
family. To support specific needs for 
healthy aging, the range includes 
two products with vitamins, minerals 
and probiotics to support bone 
health, muscle growth and strength, 
and immunity.
N3 milk will be introduced in other 
product categories later, enabling us  
to support health and well-being 
across life stages.

Drawing on our purpose – to unlock the power of 
food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and 
for generations to come – we focus our energy and 
resources on making a positive impact at scale.
We regularly conduct a materiality assessment to identify 
where Nestlé has the greatest impact on society and 
the environment, and the topics most important to our 
business success. In this section, we provide a summary 
of the top-rated themes from our latest assessment. 
Our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report  
provides more details, including how we are aligning 
with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures recommendations.
Supporting tasty and balanced diets
As a company that stands for Good food, Good life, 
Nestlé is stepping up its measures to help people enjoy 
a balanced diet. 
We are providing complete transparency on the 
nutritional value of our portfolio. Products with a Health 
Star Rating (HSR) of 3.5 stars or more – together with 
specialized nutrition products, such as baby foods, 
vitamin and mineral supplements, and medical nutrition – 
are considered nutritious. Together, these products 
accounted for close to 59% of our food and beverage 
sales in 2023. Our pet care portfolio is excluded from 
this assessment.
Looking at people’s diets holistically, we know that 
people consume food and beverages not only for 
nutrition but also for enjoyment. Nestlé aims to offer 
the right products for all these occasions, while also 
guiding people towards a more balanced diet. We are 
strengthening our responsible marketing practices, with 
new rules restricting the marketing to children under the 
age of 16 years in effect as of July 2023. We are ensuring 
that all children’s confectionery and ice cream portions 
will be 110 kilocalories or less and that all multi-serve 
products from these two categories have clear front-
of-pack portion guidance. And to help people enjoy our 
products as part of a balanced diet, we will provide more 
guidance, including recipes, menu planning, healthy 
lifestyle tips and recommendations for nutritious choices. 
Delivering food safety and quality
High standards of food safety and quality are  
non-negotiable at Nestlé and are fundamental in our 
engagement with consumers. Quality is integral to our 
Corporate Business Principles and embedded in our 
purpose and values. The end-to-end approach we take 
to food safety and quality applies to design, delivery 
and consumption. We apply international standards 
and help raise the bar in our industry using rigorous 
processes and leading scientific techniques.
We update our food safety and quality systems 
to respond to considerations, such as tightening 
regulations, changes to suppliers or ingredients, 
introduction of regenerative agriculture practices, new 
packaging and geopolitical developments. In 2023, 
our Quality Assurance Centers performed more than 
4.1 million analytical tests for quality and food safety 
risk assessment and management.
Progressing to net zero
We are more than halfway to our 2025 goal to reduce 
absolute GHG emissions included in our Net Zero 
Roadmap and are progressing well. Most of the 
reductions are due to changes in the way we source 
raw materials, such as investments in deforestation 
prevention and regenerative agriculture in our agricultural 
supply chains.
We have identified more than 80% of the supply chain 
initiatives needed to hit the 2025 target and are seeking 
further reductions to reach our planned 50% cut by 
2030. For example, through the newly inaugurated 
Nestlé Institute of Agricultural Sciences, our experts are 
exploring novel approaches in dairy farming that have 
the potential to reduce GHG emissions in the areas of 
cow feed and manure management.
Helping prevent deforestation plays a major role. By 
the end of 2023, 93.4% of our primary supply chains for 
cocoa, coffee, meat, palm oil, pulp and paper, soy and 
sugar were assessed as deforestation-free. The decrease 
from 99.1% in 2022 is due to the inclusion of coffee 
and cocoa in this indicator for the first time, where 
deforestation risk has not been assessed for as long.

As of 2023, Nestlé has approved near- and long-term 
science-based emissions reduction targets with the 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The SBTi has 
validated Nestlé’s net-zero science-based target by 2050. 
Promoting regenerative agriculture practices 
We continue making progress in responsible sourcing, 
which ensures our raw materials are traceable to point 
of origin and are farmed using methods aligned to our 
Responsible Sourcing Standard, while progressively 
delivering benefits to people, nature and climate. We have 
set requirements for 14 priority raw materials: cereals and 
grains; cocoa; coconut; coffee; dairy; fish and seafood; 
hazelnuts; meat, poultry and eggs; palm oil; pulp and 
paper; soy; spices; sugar; and vegetables. Our aim is 
for 100% of these materials to be responsibly sourced 
by end of 2030. In 2023, this figure reached 36.2%.
Reforestation within or near our sourcing locations is 
an essential part of decarbonizing our operations and 
supply chain. Nestlé became the first food and beverage 
company to pilot Airbus’s new Pléiades Neo satellites. 
We are using high-resolution images to monitor trees 
planted in our sourcing regions to ensure they thrive in 
the long term.
We continue to expand our regenerative agriculture 
program across a wider range of raw materials and 
regions, supporting farmers with training. Our farmer 
relationship management system collects data 
for over 250 000 farms, helping us track progress 
on GHG emission reductions and regenerative 
agriculture practices.
Regeneration is important for water resources as well. 
Over 40 water regeneration projects are now underway 
around our water bottling sites. Each one is tailored 
to local challenges and based on a mix of natural and 
technical solutions for improving the quality and quantity 
of water available.
Implementing our vision for packaging and circularity
Our vision remains that none of Nestlé’s packaging ends 
up in landfill or as litter. Our strategy addresses both 
product design and infrastructure systems for reuse and 
recycling. By reducing unnecessary packaging, designing 
better packaging, modeling fair collection systems 
and supporting good regulation, we aim to support the 
transition to a waste-free future.
Packaging innovations in 2023 support this transition. 
Redesigned jars for Malher Bouillon are saving 156 tonnes 
of plastic annually, with a format that is easy to recycle in 
local systems in Guatemala. In Latin America, Nescafé 
reduced single-serve sticks packaging, saving 44 tonnes 
of plastic annually.
Innovations to reach this goal go beyond packaging 
redesign. In Indonesia, we collaborated with a team 
of start-ups and retail partners to pilot a reusable and 
refillable dispenser, and single-serve reusable packaging, 
for Milo and Koko Krunch brands. Shipping innovations also 
help. Reusable shipping boxes and reusable pallet bands 
that replace plastic shrink wrap are cutting plastic use by 
100 tonnes annually in China.
We are working 
with partners on 
packaging solutions, 
including a pilot of 
reusable stainless-
steel packaging 
for Nesquik in over 
60 German grocery 
stores.

In the UK, Purina Go-Cat cat food and Nestlé 
Original Shredded Wheat cereal contain 
ingredients sourced from farmers involved  
with the LENs program.
The farms in our supply chains are 
not isolated – they are part of broader 
landscapes and economies. Only by 
joining forces with other stakeholders 
can we address complex issues, such 
as deforestation, while advancing 
regenerative agriculture practices.
Nestlé has been partnering with others 
through landscape initiatives that 
address these issues. Since 2020,  
a partnership with the Ministry of Water 
and Forests in Côte d’Ivoire and the 
Earthworm Foundation has led to  
a significant reduction in deforestation, 
as well as the reforestation of almost 
1500 hectares in the Cavally Forest 
Reserve. In 2023, the Cavally project 
entered a new phase with additional 
partners to achieve greater impact.
To help scale landscape initiatives, 
Nestlé supports Landscape Enterprise 
Networks (LENs) in the UK and Europe. 
LENs brings together organizations 
that need nature-based solutions with 
the farmers who can provide them.  
In the East of England, Purina and 
Nestlé Cereal Partners UK are working 
with water companies and local 
authorities to fund the introduction 
of nature-based solutions. Over 
60 farmers and land managers will 
implement these solutions across 
more than 10 000 hectares of land.
In 2023, we also supported sustainable 
landscape initiatives in Brazil, Chile 
and Malaysia. We are also active 
in numerous landscape initiatives

Nescafé has been introducing the 
globally loved coffee experience 
to Indian consumers. It is playing 
a lead role in developing at-home 
consumption of coffee in a country 
known for its traditional preference 
for tea.
Nescafé is leading both the creation 
of the coffee category and the market 
in India. The brand has introduced its 
coffee to more than 30 million Indian 
households in the past seven years. 
Nescafé is particularly focused on 
growing the coffee culture among 
Indian youth, establishing the role 
of coffee in their lives.
Manufactured at the state-of-the-art 
Nanjangud roastery, Nescafé roasts 
Indian green coffee beans, tailoring 
the final product to cater to local 
taste preferences. Thanks to strategic 
positioning, Nescafé is increasingly 
available and easily accessible 
across the country in three million 
retail outlets. 
By investing in product quality and 
consistently communicating the 
relevance of coffee, Nescafé has 
captured the attention and loyalty of 
its target audience, recruiting non-
coffee drinkers to choose coffee as 
their beverage of choice. Alongside 
these efforts to bring coffee culture to 
India, Nescafé is backing its Nescafé 
Plan 2030 with actions on the ground. 
It is helping ensure that the entire value 
chain of coffee is sustainable as well 
as socially and economically inclusive.

Pet owners are increasingly choosing 
to customize their pet’s nutrition with 
supplements, toppers and snacks that 
cater to their pet’s individual needs. 
Purina is responding to this shift 
in consumer habits with additional 
health-focused nutrition options. 
Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Supplements 
are specialized supplements for dogs 
and cats, designed to support their 
health and address specific conditions.
Digestive disorders are common 
health issues for pets, varying from 
minor upset stomachs to more 
severe gastrointestinal problems 
or food allergies. Purina Pro Plan 
Veterinary Supplements FortiFlora is 
the #1 U.S. recommended probiotic 
by veterinarians. It is a proprietary 
probiotic supplement that supports 
digestive health and helps improve 
stool quality in dogs and cats. 
Water is crucial for cats, just like it is 
for humans. Many cats dislike drinking 
water – especially still or stagnant 
water – which can lead to dehydration. 
Purina Pro Plan Hydra Care addresses 
this, offering nutrient-enriched water 
for cats. It contains osmolytes that help 
cats absorb water at a cellular level, 
ensuring they stay hydrated.
Like humans, dogs can experience 
anxiety, which varies across breeds 
and individuals. Purina Pro Plan 
Veterinary Supplements Calming Care 
includes a proprietary probiotic strain 
shown to help dogs and cats manage 
stress and maintain calm behavior. Brittany Vester Boler

A collaboration between Nestlé and 
the Bangladesh Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research (BCSIR) has 
resulted in a groundbreaking product 
to help combat malnutrition in young 
children in Bangladesh.
A significant percentage of Bangladeshi 
children under the age of 5 years suffer 
from various micronutrient deficiencies. 
In collaboration with BCSIR, Nestlé 
Bangladesh developed a cereal-based 
fortifier, Cerelac Pushtimix (pushtimix 
means mix of nutrients in Bangla) to 
address these deficiencies. Specifically 
designed to cater to the nutritional 
needs of Bangladeshi children aged  
6 to 60 months, Cerelac Pushtimix is 
fortified with 11 vitamins, 5 minerals 
and probiotic B. lactis. 
Cerelac Pushtimix was designed to 
give parents a simple, accessible 
format to help combat malnutrition 
in their young children. Developed as 
a convenient powder, consumers can 
easily sprinkle it on homemade foods. 
The aim is to make it accessible to all 
children, including those in rural areas, 
thanks to its affordable price point 
of BDT 5 (less than 5 Swiss centimes) 
per 5g sachet. 
In 2023, Nestlé Bangladesh was 
honored with the prestigious SDG 
Brand Champion Award in Sustainable 
Partnerships & Institutions. The 
Bangladesh Brand Forum, in 
collaboration with the Global Compact 
Network Bangladesh, bestowed 
this award in recognition for this 
successful collaboration’s support 
for the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).

Building on MyMenu IQ, available in over

Consumers worldwide want food 
that tastes great while providing 
the nutrition they need, all within 
their budgets. To address this 
challenge, Nestlé is constantly 
developing products that are 
delicious, affordable and nutritious.
Plant-based meals can offer quality 
nutrition, including protein, and many 
consumers are interested in trying 
these. In Italy, Garden Gourmet is 
enabling more families to access 
plant-based products at an attractive 
price point. The tasty Garden Gourmet 
99kcal Miniburger, for example,  
is made with quinoa, bulgur, carrots 
and broccoli.
Nestlé uses its innovation expertise 
to give consumers affordable and 
nutritious products they can use  
in their favorite recipes. In 2023, 
Nestlé launched Maggi Soya Chunks, 
which offers Nigerian consumers  
a tasty meat alternative for rice, 
stews and pasta. Not only does this 
provide a convenient and affordable 
way to deliver the flavor of meat  
at a fraction of the cost, Maggi Soya 
Chunks also provides a nutritious 
source of protein, iron and zinc. 
Nestlé continues to create new 
options that provide quality protein 
through grains. As part of the 
International Year of Millets 2023,  
we launched Maggi Nutri-licious 
Masala Oats Noodles with Millet 
Magic. This product leverages 
the power of these ancient grains 
to bring protein and fiber to 
Indian consumers in one of their 
favorite meals.

Ninho, together with thousands  
of milk-producing families, delivers 
nutrition that supports a better future 
for over 38 million Brazilian children. 
In support of a bright tomorrow, 
Nestlé is incentivizing Brazilian dairy 
farmers to protect and restore natural 
resources by adopting sustainable 
farming measures.
The Nature por Ninho program trains 
and incentivizes farmers to adopt 
regenerative agriculture practices  
that result in lower carbon emissions 
and increased carbon sequestration. 
By adopting practices, such as water 
conservation, manure and waste 
management, minimum cultivation 
and soil cover, crop rotation and 
better animal welfare practices, 
dairy farmers can enable sustainable 
farming for generations to come. 
Farmers in the program can engage  
in three levels of regenerative 
agriculture practices: bronze, silver 
and gold. For each level, the farmer 
receives an extra bonus in pay per 
liter of milk. At the end of 2023, 
179 Nature por Ninho farms were 
in the gold category, supplying 
17 million liters of milk per month. 
In 2023, the Ninho team embarked 
on a mission to communicate 
these best farming practices to 
consumers, sharing progress on 
three pillars: animal welfare, soil 
and water. Through nationwide 
communication, including Ninho 
Forti+ commemorative packs, 
millions of Brazilian consumers  
are learning about the difference  
that comes from the farm.
OUR VOICES
“By 2025, our aim is to have 
30% of  the Brazilian milk in 
our supply chain coming from 
gold-category dairy farms.”

regeneration

Switzerland
OUR VOICES 
“We are confident that as  
the program scales, we will  
see a measurable impact 
on cocoa farmers’ incomes 
and an improvement 
in the lives of  children.”
Our income accelerator program 
aims to improve the livelihoods of 
cocoa-farming families and tackle 
child labor risks in cocoa production, 
while advancing sustainable farming 
practices. Now, cocoa from the 
program has found its way to KitKat.
The program incentivizes and 
encourages change in cocoa-farming 
families through a cash incentive paid 
directly to them through mobile money. 
It supports four areas: child education, 
good agricultural practices (GAP), 
agroforestry and diversified incomes.
Since the launch in 2022, the program 
has benefited 10 000 cocoa-farming 
families in Côte d’Ivoire. It will expand 
to include Ghana in 2024. Initial 
results from a report by third-party KIT 
Royal Tropical Institute are promising, 
while also informing program 
improvements. Pruning has increased 
cocoa farm productivity by more than 
20%, on average. School enrollment 
rates have risen by 8%, reaching 83%. 
Women are more involved in decision-
making, which has improved the 
allocation of family resources. Cash 
incentives are primarily used where 
it matters most, first and foremost 
for schooling.
We are also putting into practice 
our ambition to fully segregate our 
cocoa ingredients. In late 2023, KitKat 
factories in Hamburg, Germany, and 
Sofia, Bulgaria, started using 100% 
segregated chocolate mass from the 
income accelerator program. We will 
expand segregation in KitKat factories 
to most of Europe by early 2024.

Group overview
Foreword
The Financial review contains certain financial 
performance measures, that are not defined by 
IFRS Accounting Standards (thereafter “IFRS”), 
that are used by management to assess the 
financial and operational performance of the 
Group. They include among others:
 – Organic growth, Real internal growth  
and Pricing;
 – Underlying trading operating profit margin  
and Trading operating profit margin;
 – Net financial debt;
 – Free cash flow; and
 – Underlying earnings per share (EPS) and EPS  
in constant currency.
Management believes that these non -IFRS 
financial performance measures provide useful 
information regarding the Group’s financial and 
operating performance.
The Alternative Performance Measures  document 
published under www.nestle.com/investors/
publications defines these non -IFRS financial 
performance measures.
Group sales
Organic growth was 7.2%. Pricing was 7.5%, 
reflecting cost inflation over the last two years. 
RIG was – 0.3%, impacted by soft consumer 
demand, capacity constraints and a temporary 
supply disruption for vitamins, minerals and 
supplements in the second half. As expected, 
RIG turned positive in both the fourth quarter and 
the second half, supported by the benefits from 
portfolio optimization, improving customer service 
levels and increased brand support. 
Growth was broad-based across most geographies 
and categories. In developed markets, organic 
growth was 6.4%, led by pricing with negative 
RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 
8.4%, driven by pricing and positive RIG. 
By product category, Purina PetCare was the 
largest contributor to organic growth, with strong 
momentum across all channels. Purina ONE, 
Purina Pro Plan and Friskies all recorded double-
digit growth. Sales of Purina Pro Plan reached 
almost CHF 3 billion. Coffee saw high single-
digit growth, with positive sales developments 
across brands, supported by strong demand in 
out-of-home channels. Infant Nutrition posted 
high single-digit growth, based on continued 
momentum for premium infant formula, including 
human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products 
as well as specialty formulas. Dairy reported 
mid single-digit growth, led by fortified milks, 
coffee creamers and home-baking products. 
Confectionery recorded high single-digit growth, 
fueled by continued double-digit growth for 
KitKat. Prepared dishes and cooking aids posted 
mid single-digit growth, with robust demand for 
Maggi across geographies and segments. Water 
posted mid single-digit growth, led by S.Pellegrino 
and Acqua Panna. Nestlé Health Science recorded 
low single-digit growth, as continued strong 
momentum for Medical Nutrition was partly offset 
by temporary supply constraints in vitamins, 
minerals and supplements.

By channel, organic growth in retail sales 
remained robust at 6.5%. E-commerce sales 
grew by 13.4%, reaching 17.1% of total Group 
sales. Organic growth of out-of-home channels 
was 15.9%. 
Net divestitures decreased sales by 0.9%, largely 
related to the divestment of a majority stake in 
Freshly as well as the disposal of the Gerber Good 
Start infant formula brand in 2022. The impact 
on sales from foreign exchange was negative 
at 7.8%, following significant and broad-based 
appreciation of the Swiss franc. Total reported 
sales decreased by 1.5% to CHF 93.0 billion.

Underlying trading operating profit
The underlying trading operating profit margin 
increased by 20 basis points to 17.3% on a 
reported basis and by 40 basis points in constant 
currency. Underlying trading operating profit 
decreased by 0.3% to CHF 16.1 billion, due to 
currency appreciation. 
Gross profit margin increased by 70 basis 
points to 45.9%. Pricing, cost efficiencies and 
portfolio optimization more than offset significant 
cost inflation.
Distribution costs as a percentage of sales 
decreased by 60 basis points to 8.3% of sales, 
mainly as a result of lower freight and energy costs. 
Marketing and administration expenses as a 
percentage of sales were 18.9%. Within this line 
item, advertising and marketing expenses were 
7.7% of sales, an increase of 80 basis points 
compared to the prior year. 
Restructuring and net other trading items 
decreased from CHF 2.9 billion to CHF 1.5 billion, 
reflecting one-off items in the prior year, particularly 
asset impairments. As a result, trading operating 
profit increased by 10.0% to CHF 14.5 billion. The 
trading operating profit margin reached 15.6%, 
an increase of 160 basis points on a reported basis 
and 190 basis points in constant currency.

Net financial expenses and Income tax
Net financial expenses increased to CHF 1.4 billion, 
reflecting an increase in interest rates and a higher 
level of average net debt. The average cost of net 
debt was 2.5% compared to 2.2% in 2022. 
The Group reported tax rate decreased by 
600 basis points to 18.2% as a result of one-off 
items. The underlying tax rate increased by 
30 basis points to 21.2%, mainly due to the 
geographic and business mix.
Net profit and Earnings per share
Net profit increased by 20.9% to CHF 11.2 billion. 
Net profit margin increased by 230 basis points to 
12.1% on a reported basis and by 240 basis points 
in constant currency. The increase was mainly due 
to lower asset impairments, a decrease in reported 
taxes and higher income from associates. As a 
result, earnings per share increased by 23.7% to 
CHF 4.24 on a reported basis.
Underlying earnings per share increased by 8.4% 
in constant currency and by 0.1% on a reported 
basis to CHF 4.80. The increase was mainly the 
result of strong organic growth and improved 
underlying trading operating profit margin.  
Nestlé’s share buyback program contributed 1.2% 
to the underlying earnings per share increase, net 
of finance costs.
Cash flow
Free cash flow increased to CHF 10.4 billion 
from CHF 6.6 billion, mainly due to lower 
inventory levels.

Nestlé Waters Operations
Following a transformation plan in France, Nestlé 
is reviewing operating practices in its natural 
mineral water operations in several countries. 
With food safety as a primary goal, practices at 
some of its production sites may not be in line 
with the applicable regulatory framework. Nestlé 
regrets the situation and is currently engaging 
with the relevant authorities to ensure that its 
operating practices are fully compliant. The 
company emphasizes that its water products 
have always been, and remain, safe to drink. 
In addition, the unique mineral composition of 
its natural mineral water brands has always been 
consistent with the label.
Outlook
2024 outlook:  we expect organic sales growth 
around 4% and a moderate increase in the 
underlying trading operating profit margin. 
Underlying earnings per share in constant 
currency is expected to increase between 6% 
and 10%.
2025 mid-term targets fully confirmed:  
mid single-digit organic sales growth and an 
underlying trading operating profit margin 
range of 17.5% to 18.5% by 2025. Underlying 
earnings per share in constant currency to 
increase between 6% and 10%.

 – The Zone’s underlying trading operating profit 
margin increased by 120 basis points to 22.2%.
Organic growth was 7.3%, with pricing of 7.6%. 
RIG was – 0.3%, reflecting soft consumer demand, 
capacity constraints and the winding down of 
the frozen meals and pizza business in Canada. 
RIG turned positive in the fourth quarter. Net 
divestitures reduced sales by 1.7%, as a result of the 
divestment of a majority stake in Freshly as well as 
the disposal of the Gerber Good Start infant formula 
brand in 2022. Foreign exchange had a negative 
impact of 6.8%. Reported sales in Zone North 
America decreased by 1.3% to CHF 26.0 billion. 
Growth in Zone North America was broad-based, 
driven by pricing as well as continued strong 
momentum for e-commerce and out-of-home 
channels. The Zone saw market share gains in pet 
food, coffee and frozen meals.  
By product category, Purina PetCare was the 
largest growth contributor, with broad-based 
demand across segments, channels and 
brands, particularly Purina ONE, Purina Pro 
Plan and Friskies. Sales for Nestlé Professional 
and Starbucks out-of-home continued to grow 
at a double-digit rate, led by new customer 
acquisition. The beverages category, including 
Starbucks products, Coffee mate and Nescafé, 
posted mid single-digit growth. Nido growing-up 
milks posted strong double-digit growth. 
Confectionery in Canada recorded high single-
digit growth, driven by KitKat and Aero. Water saw 
low single-digit growth, based on a strong sales 
development in the fourth quarter. S.Pellegrino 
and Acqua Panna posted double-digit growth, 
which more than offset the impact of capacity 
constraints for Perrier. Growth in frozen food was

food was close to flat, supported by Stouffer’s, 
Jack’s and Tombstone.
The Zone’s underlying trading operating profit 
margin increased by 120 basis points, mainly as 
a result of the divestment of a majority stake in 
Freshly and portfolio optimization actions. Pricing

 – 1.6% organic growth: – 3.2% RIG; 4.8% pricing. 
 – The underlying trading operating profit margin 
decreased by 160 basis points to 12.0%. 
Organic growth was 1.6%, with pricing of 4.8%. 
RIG was – 3.2%, impacted by a temporary 
supply constraint for the vitamins, minerals and 
supplements business. Net acquisitions increased 
sales by 3.1%, largely related to the consolidation 
of Orgain from April 2022. Foreign exchange 
negatively impacted sales by 6.2%. Reported 
sales in Nestlé Health Science decreased by 1.6% 
to CHF 6.5 billion.
Vitamins, minerals and supplements saw 
negative growth. Sales in the second half 
decreased following an IT integration issue 
encountered during the consolidation of U.S. 
packaging sites. The recovery is taking longer 
than expected as the extent of the issue was 
deeper and more complex than initially thought. 
The resulting supply constraints are expected 
to be fully resolved by the end of the first half of 
2024, with an acceleration of growth expected 
in the second half of the year. Vitamins, minerals 
and supplements brand Pure Encapsulations 
was not affected by the supply issue and saw 
double-digit growth. 
Active Nutrition reported mid single-digit growth, 
with robust sales developments for Orgain and 
Vital Proteins.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group aims to adopt a risk profile aligned to our 
purpose and business strategy. We strive to create long-
term value through a balance of sustainable growth and 
resource efficiency. Our culture and values – rooted in 
respect for ourselves, others, diversity and the future – 
guide our decisions and actions. Our Creating Shared 
Value approach helps us prioritize those areas that 
maximize value creation for shareholders and cultivate 
positive societal and environmental impacts.
The Nestlé Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
framework is designed to assess and mitigate risks in 
order to minimize their potential impact and support the 
achievement of Nestlé’s long-term purpose and business 
strategy. A top-down assessment is performed at Group-
level once a year. A bottom-up assessment occurs in 
parallel, resulting in aggregation of the individual market 
assessments. This creates a good understanding of the 
company’s key risks in order to allocate ownership to 
drive specific actions around them and take any relevant 
steps to address them. 
Additionally, Nestlé engages with external stakeholders 
to better understand the issues that are of most concern 
to them. The materiality assessment (included in the 
Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report) rates 
the degree of external stakeholder concern and potential 
business impact. This helps to ensure that wider 
sustainability issues are incorporated into the risks and 
opportunities under consideration across the company. 
Risk assessments and any mitigating actions are the 
responsibility of the individual line management. If 
Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for 
mitigating actions will generally be determined by the 
Executive Board. The annual Group risk assessment 
is reported annually to the Executive Board, Audit 
Committee and Board of Directors. Under the Group’s 
governance, the full Board is responsible for risk 
oversight. Further details of the ERM processes can be 
found in the Corporate Governance Report.
We are committed to transparency and action on 
climate-related risks and opportunities. We have aligned 
our reporting disclosures with the recommendations of 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), which can be found in our Creating Shared Value 
and Sustainability Report.
The risks listed below are considered the most relevant 
for our business and performance. Many of the 
longer-term mitigation strategies are expanded on in 
our Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report.

non-financial reporting. Chaired by our Lead Independent 
Director, the Nomination Committee evaluates Board 
composition, performance, structure and succession 
planning, and assesses candidates for nomination to the 
Board. The Compensation Committee ensures alignment 
of our remuneration systems with our values, strategies

action is in line with our detailed Net Zero Roadmap, 
which our shareholders endorsed at the 2021 Annual 
General Meeting. As of 2024, we will submit our report 
on non-financial matters to a vote by shareholders 
as required by Swiss law. While making our portfolio 
good for the planet, we further intensified our efforts to 
provide consumers with nutritious, healthy and enjoyable 
products and to establish new global best practice in 
product nutrition transparency. 
Nestlé’s Board of Directors is engaged in overseeing 
the direction of the company. We have continued to 
strengthen the Board by adding new independent 
directors with diverse experience and skillsets 
directly relevant to Nestlé, for example, with respect 
to food systems, food and beverage, digitalization, 
marketing, sustainability, geopolitics and other topics. 
Engagement with our shareholders takes place through 
our roadshows, investor meetings, analyst calls and 
Chairman’s Roundtables, where we meet with investors 
from Asia, North America, Switzerland, Germany, the UK, 
France and the Netherlands.
The Chair’s and Corporate Governance Committee 
regularly reviews all aspects of our governance. In 2023, 
it reviewed the roles and responsibilities with regards 
to our ESG/sustainability reporting. Our Board approves 
the ESG/sustainability strategy proposed by management 
and submits our report on non-financial matters to the 
Annual General Meeting. Advising on our environmental 
and social sustainability, including our response to 
climate change and our human rights due diligence 
program, the Sustainability Committee has oversight 
over the structure and content of the ESG/sustainability 
reporting. The Audit Committee oversees internal and 
external audit and reviews reports regarding internal 
controls, compliance, fraud and risk management;  
it has oversight over the accuracy of our financial and  
Corporate Governance

Compliance
Compliance is our commitment to act with honesty, 
integrity and respect for our own values, principles and 
policies, and for the laws and regulations where we 
operate. It is a non-negotiable requirement for everything 
we do and enables sustainable business growth. Our 
comprehensive Compliance Management System, 
comprised of policies, processes, controls and tools, is 
regularly reviewed to ensure we proactively uphold our 
values and address relevant risks, while also meeting the 
multiple and incremental regulatory requirements.
Nestlé’s Board of Directors and Executive Board oversee 
and promote good practices throughout the company. 
Management is supported by our Legal and Compliance 
function, which provides guidance and functional 
leadership, as well as by all other functions engaged 
in our risk- and principles-based compliance program. 
The Group Compliance Committee ensures a continuous 
evolution of our Integrated Assurance Framework, while 
market compliance officers and committees ensure a 
consistent approach across the Group and help identify 
local compliance priorities. Compliance is monitored 
through our corporate functions, including Audit, and 
external auditors.
In 2023, employees completed more than 970 000 
e-modules on topics such as our Corporate Business 
Principles, compliance, human rights, security, sexual 
harassment, antitrust, and diversity and inclusion. We 
also launched a new mandatory training on transacting 
ethically and responsibly (with a focus on anti-money 
laundering) for a selected subset of people managers and 
a recommended training on anti-bribery and corruption 
for all employees.
This year marks the last year of the 2021-2023 CARE 
program cycle, through which we assess our sites on 
specific aspects of our social compliance including health 
and safety, environment and working conditions, with 
the help of independent external auditors. A total of 
194 audits were performed in 2023, covering 440 sites. 
We have enhanced the program in preparation for the 
new 2024-2026 CARE cycle, particularly in assessing 
human rights in our sites. 
Our Speak Up system, independently operated by 
a third party, allows us to investigate and address 
potential non-compliance concerns from employees 
and external stakeholders. We have addressed 
substantiated complaints on issues such as abuse of 
power and/or mobbing/bullying, labor practices, sexual 
harassment and conflicts of interest, among others. 
As a consequence of all the substantiated cases in 
2023, 122 employees had to leave our company and 
15 service providers were terminated as a result of 
non-compliance incidents. In 2023, we developed 
a new training, Conducting Investigations on Behavior-
Related Allegations, to guide our markets and serve 
as a comprehensive toolkit of best practices.
An annual compliance communication plan strengthens 
and sustains a business ethics and compliance culture. 
This enables good business decisions and enhances 
the trust in Nestlé by our stakeholders.
