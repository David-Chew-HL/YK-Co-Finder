Statement of the Board of Directors of Top Glove Corporation Bhd
The Board acknowledges its responsibility to ensure the integrity of the Integrated Annual Report. In the Board’s opinion,  
the Report addresses all material issues and matters and fairly presents the Group’s performance of the financial year.
We measure our performance by evaluating how we create 
value for our key stakeholders, taking into account our 
progress against our strategy, and by regularly measuring 
returns on invested capital. We understand the risks we take 
and manage these to minimise their impact on our business 
and results. We pursue growth by building an organisation that 
empowers people and enriches communities.
HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER
Approved by the Board and acknowledged on behalf of the 
Board by:
TAN SRI DR LIM WEE CHAI
Executive Chairman
LIM CHEONG GUAN
Managing Director
This Report contains forward-looking statements concerning 
our business. These forward-looking statements are subject 
to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
beyond our control and all of which are based on our current 
beliefs and expectations about future events. Forward-looking 
statements are typically identified by the use of forward-looking 
terminology such as “believes”, “expects”, “may”, “will”, 
“could”, “should”, “intends”, “estimates”, “plans”, “assumes” 
or “anticipates”, or the negative thereof, or other variations 
thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of 
strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-
looking statements and other statements contained in this 
Integrated Annual Report regarding matters that are not 
historical facts involve predictions. 
While we believe these statements are reasonable, they 
inherently involve risks and uncertainties, however, we shall 
fervently work towards the results and developments outlined 
in the said statement. Such risks and uncertainties could 
cause actual results to vary materially from the future results 
indicated, expressed or implied in such forward-looking 
statements. 
The forward-looking statements contained in the Integrated 
Annual Report speak only as of the date of the Report. We 
are not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaim any 
such obligation to) revise or update any forward-looking 
statements to reflect events or circumstances after 
the date of the Report or to reflect the occurrence of 
unanticipated events. We cannot give any assurance that  
forward-looking statements will prove correct and 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any 
forward-looking statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Financial and non-financial reporting
This Report constitutes the Integrated Annual Report as 
defined in terms of Malaysian law and extends beyond 
financial reporting. It reflects on non-financial performance, 
opportunities, risks and outcomes attributable to or associated 
with stakeholders who have a significant influence on our 
ability to create value. Our reporting coverage is based on 
group-level disclosure unless stated otherwise. There is no 
significant change to our structure, ownership and supply 
chain during the reporting year. Group reporting standards are 
continually being developed to make disclosure meaningful 
and measurable for stakeholders.
SCOPE AND BOUNDARY OF REPORTING
We apply the principle of materiality in assessing what 
information to include in our Integrated Annual Report. This 
Report focuses particularly on those issues, opportunities and 
challenges that impact materially on the Group as well as on 
its ability to be a sustainable business that delivers value to 
key stakeholders, including our shareholders.
MATERIALITY AND MATERIAL MATTERS
In line with best practice for Integrated Reporting, we report 
on the six (6) capitals that together, provide a true picture of 
value across the Group. This way of telling a comprehensive, 
connected story fits well with our holistic view of value and our 
focus on creating sustainable value with responsibility in mind, 
for long-term good.

Our Business Overview
Listed on the Bursa Malaysia Stock 
Exchange (2001) and the Singapore 
Exchange Main Board (2016), it is also 
one of the component stocks of the FBM 
Top 100 Index, FBM Emas Index, FBM 
Hijrah Shariah Index, FBM Emas Shariah 
Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability 
Indices (DJSI) for Emerging Markets.
A Forbes Global 2000 company, Top 
Glove has an established corporate 
culture and good business direction 
of producing consistently high quality 
gloves at efficient low cost. Beyond 
gloves, the Company’s product range 
has expanded to include dental 
dams, exercise bands, latex sheets, 
tourniquets, condoms, face masks, and 
Cast Polyethylene (CPE) Aprons.
Top Glove continues to strengthen its 
commitment to Environmental, Social 
and Governance (“ESG”) principles. 
In February 2024, the Company was 
included in the S&P Global Sustainability 
Yearbook 2024 for the third consecutive 
year, reaffirming its unwavering 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and responsible corporate citizenship. 
In July 2024, Top Glove further 
demonstrated its progress by achieving 
an ‘A’ in the 2024 MSCI ESG Ratings, 
an improvement from its previous ‘BBB’ 
rating in 2023, underscoring its efforts 
in managing financially relevant ESG 
risks and opportunities. In September 
2024, the Company ranked 7th among 
854 public listed companies in Malaysia 
in the Overall Excellence Award at 
the National Corporate Governance & 
Sustainability Awards 2024, a testament 
to its robust commitment and investment 
in sustainability, as recognised by 
industry and stakeholders alike.
In September 2024, the Group released 
the results of a Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA), which evaluates the environmental 
impact of a product throughout its entire 
life cycle, from raw material extraction 
to disposal. Additionally, the Group was 
awarded the EcoVadis Sustainability 
Bronze Medal for the second year 
running, with a 12% improvement in 
scoring from 2023, placing it amongst 
the top 19% of all companies and 
industries evaluated at the time of 
publication in September 2024.
As the glove industry recovers, Top Glove 
anticipates continuous improvement 
in sales orders, particularly in the U.S. 
market, due to impending tariff increases 
on Chinese medical gloves. The Group 
will resume the installation of advanced 
production lines at its newer factories to 
meet rising demand while maintaining a 
cautious approach to capacity expansion 
amid geopolitical uncertainties. The 
financial performance in FY2024 has 
shown positive EBITDA and healthy 
sales volume growth, both of which 
indicate a resurgence in the market. With 
ongoing improvement initiatives and 
strong employee support, Top Glove is  
well-positioned to achieve profitability 
in FY2025 and remains committed to 
sustainable growth in the essential glove 
market.
Established in 1991 and headquartered in Malaysia, Top Glove 
Corporation Bhd began as a local business enterprise with 
only 1 factory and 1 glove production line. The Company has 
since become the world’s largest manufacturer of gloves with 
manufacturing operations in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
The Company also has marketing offices in these countries as well 
as USA, China, Germany and Brazil. Top Glove has over 2,000 
customers worldwide and exports to more than 195 countries.

Resilience in Action:
Our Journey of Recovery and Growth
Good health and good day Fellow Stakeholders.
The financial year 2024 (FY2024) marked a pivotal chapter for the Group.  
We navigated our way through a severely disrupted business landscape 
fraught with persistent supply and demand imbalances and intense 
competition, whilst forging ahead to gain significant traction on our recovery 
path.
With a sharp focus on strengthening our core glove business, we stepped 
up implementation of strategic quality and cost enhancements, rendering 
operations leaner and more efficient. Alongside, global glove demand  
gradually returned, following the depletion of customer stockpiles and 
resumption of restocking activity. These collectively paved the way for the 
Group to deliver a substantially improved performance for the financial year 
ended 2024, moving us closer to breakeven and imminent profitability.
The reasons for our optimism are manifold. Robust sales volume growth. 
Enhanced economies of scale. Diminished operational losses. Positive full 
year EBITDA.
And this is just the beginning. With our foundation strengthened and 
competitiveness restored, we are well-positioned to ride the recovery wave 
and thrive as the glove industry turns a corner.
The worst is behind us while a promising future lies ahead. We have survived, 
and now, it is time to flourish.

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS
A Resilient Board for a Better Future 
As part of the Group’s ongoing efforts to ensure an agile and high performing Board of Directors, primed to meet the challenges 
of a dynamic business environment, the Group appointed Ms. Gan Mei Mei and Mr. Lee Ah Too, as its new Independent  
Non-Executive Directors in March 2024 and June 2024 respectively.
The Group also saw the retirement of Ms. Sharmila Sekarajasekaran in line with the Group’s Independent Director Tenure Policy, 
which limits board service to a maximum term of 9 years, reflecting international best practices. In addition, its Independent 
Directors Dr. Chong Su-Lin, Dato’ Lee Kim Meow, Puan Rowina Ghazali Seth and Mr. Martin Manen stepped down to attend to 
personal commitments. Top Glove is deeply appreciative of its directors for their invaluable service and positive contributions 
which have driven meaningful progress and growth for the company.
With these developments, Top Glove’s 33% female Board representation continues to surpass the best practice benchmark 
of 30%, underscoring our commitment to fostering gender diversity as well as broader objectives of cultivating an inclusive 
and diverse leadership team. The Board’s balanced composition, which comprises five Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and four Executive Directors, has been designed to bolster independence in decision-making efficacy and strategic oversight, 
and is consistent with the board structures of peer companies.
A testament to its unwavering commitment to corporate governance and sustainability, Top Glove also garnered the Overall 
Excellence Award at the National Corporate Governance & Sustainability Awards (NACGSA) 2024 in September 2024. 
The Company ranked number 7 amongst the 20 winners of this prestigious accolade, standing out amongst the 854 listed 
companies in Malaysia which were assessed by the Minority Shareholders Watch Group (MSWG).
Enhancing Shareholder Value
The Group proposed a bonus issue of up to 405,846,911 warrants on the basis of 1 warrant for every 20 existing Top Glove 
shares, subject to shareholders’ approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 15 January 2025. The warrants 
are exercisable anytime within 5 years from the date of issuance, the exercise price of which will be announced at a later date. 
The proposed bonus issue of warrants enables Top Glove shareholders to increase their equity participation in the Group, 
by exercising the warrants at a pre-determined price during the tenure of the warrants, rewarding loyal shareholders for their 
continued support. The exercise will also strengthen the Group’s capital base, enabling it to raise funds without incurring 
additional interest expense, as compared to bank borrowings.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Strong Sales Growth Sets the Stage for Turnaround
For FY2024, the Group registered Sales Revenue of RM2.51 
billion, an uptick of 11% from FY2023. Loss After Tax which 
factored in gains from land disposal, reduced considerably 
to RM21 million, a commendable upsurge of 98% against 
FY2023. Meanwhile, the Group’s full year EBITDA turned 
positive at RM253 million; this represented an improvement 
of 262% compared with FY2023. Sales Volume also rose by 
19% from FY2023.
The Group’s notably improved performance was attributed to 
increased Sales Volume as customers continued to replenish 
glove inventories, leading to higher utilisation rates and 
enhanced operational efficiency. Throughout the financial year 
in review, the Group noted a steady improvement in Sales 
Volume, which had bottomed out in 4QFY2023 and started 
picking up in 1QFY2024 to reach its peak in 4QFY2024, 
representing a surge of 91% year-on-year and its strongest 
growth since the pandemic. The Group saw especially 
strong growth in the U.S. where Sales Volume soared 120% 
quarter-on-quarter and 29% year-on-year, further driven by 
the inclusion of a large number of foreign manufacturers’ 
gloves on the U.S. FDA’s import alert list.
As Sales Volume growth gained traction in 2HFY2024, the 
Group saw a corresponding improvement in its utilisation 
rate on running capacity, which increased to 60% from below 
Letter to Stakeholders and 
Management Discussion & Analysis
35% in 1HFY2024. This gave rise to enhanced production 
efficiencies, enabling the Group to reduce its cost per carton 
for natural gas by 15%, labour by 41% and electricity by 18%. 
Glove demand continued to intensify in 2HFY2024 on the back 
of depleting glove inventory coupled with high tariffs imposed 
on medical gloves made in China. However, despite having 
excess capacity, Malaysian glove manufacturers were unable 
to fully leverage the improving glove demand due to labour 
shortage arising from the government freeze on foreign worker 
intake. This resulted in glove demand exceeding supply, 
which helped facilitate cost pass-through from raw material 
price fluctuations, as well as gradual upward price revisions, 
improving profit margins.
The Group had anticipated achieving breakeven in 4QFY2024, 
which was impacted by the drastic and sudden depreciation 
of the U.S. Dollar against the Malaysian Ringgit in August 
2024. The U.S. Dollar declined by an average of 2.6% against 
the Malaysian Ringgit in 4QFY2024, and an average of 5.4% 
in August 2024 to RM4.3155 by month end. This led to both 
realised and unrealised foreign exchange losses in 4QFY2024, 
offsetting gains from the higher Sales Volume and lower 
production costs. In response, the Group has revised its 
selling prices upwards, the effects of which will be realised 
from November 2024 onwards due to the time lag.
The Group’s Performance Improvement Milestones for FY2024 
and FY2024 Sales Volume by Region are summarised in the

Letter to Stakeholders and 
Management Discussion & Analysis
Enhancing our stable of renewable products, the 
Group developed the plant-based Thermoplastic 
Elastomer (TPE) Top Grip glove as well as a  
plant-based Chlorinated Polyethylene (CPE) glove.
A more sustainable option, the TPE Top Grip glove

We deeply appreciate your continued support and are excited to move forward together with you, on our mutually rewarding 
journey towards a triumphant comeback and greater heights of achievement thereafter.
Against an uncertain and evolving backdrop, glove industry fundamentals have stayed robust and unchanged. Gloves remain 
firmly entrenched as an essential, single-use item in the healthcare industry, for which there is no viable replacement to date. 
Adding to this the increased level of health and hygiene awareness post pandemic, the Group is confident that the long-term 
industry outlook holds immense promise, with global glove demand set to strengthen and accelerate in the years ahead.
IN APPRECIATION OF OUR PARTNERS IN PROGRESS
It is with profound gratitude that we acknowledge the unique and invaluable contributions of those who have stood by 
us through challenging times, each playing a pivotal role in our path forward.  We are privileged to partner with multiple 
stakeholders on our journey of recovery and growth, and place on record our heartfelt thanks to:
Committed to Championing Business and Human Rights
Business and human rights (BHR) remain central to our 
operations. We are continuously aligning our systems and 
processes to meet the evolving regulatory requirements 
worldwide. To this end, regular meetings between the Board 
of Directors and senior management ensure that BHR 
principles are not only aligned with global standards but 
also integrated into our strategic decision-making. Through 
these ongoing engagements, we reaffirm our commitment to 
ethical business practices, fostering a work environment that 
prioritises fairness, respect and accountability.
Advancing Healthcare for Our People and the Community 
Top Glove Global Doctors (TGGD), a joint venture between   
Top Glove and Global Doctors, is a comprehensive  
Ambulatory Care Centre located in Top Glove Tower, offering 
a wide range of family, specialist, dental and emergency 
services, to ensure our employees and their families have 
easy access to quality healthcare. In addition to these 
core services, TGGD also offers in-house physiotherapy, 
mental health counselling and a medical concierge service, 
contributing to the overall well-being of both Top Glove’s 
workforce and the surrounding community. These services 
aim to support both physical and mental health, promoting

of a haemodialysis unit and Traditional Chinese Medicine 
services, TGGD is set to deliver even more comprehensive 
healthcare solutions to meet the diverse needs of both the 
Top Glove family and the broader Setia Alam community.
FROM REVERSAL TO RECOVERY: GLOVE ON THE 
REBOUND
Having concluded FY2024 on a positive note amidst a 
challenging environment, we are encouraged by the progress 
the Group has charted and more importantly, upbeat about 
the financial year ahead.
The glove industry has already entered a recovery phase, 
which is fast gaining momentum. With excess glove stocks 
fully depleted, this has set in motion an ongoing inventory 
replenishment cycle, driving strong demand growth. Given 
the increasingly favourable demand-supply dynamics, the 
Group expects to see continual increase in Sales Volume and 
utilisation rate, setting the scene for an inevitable return to 
black within the new Financial Year 2025.
Moreover, the Group anticipates enhanced business 
opportunities in the U.S. market following the United 
States Trade Representative (USTR)’s September 2024 
announcement of impending tariff increases on Chinese 
medical and surgical gloves from the existing rate of 7.5% 
to 50% effective January 2025, and to 100% by January 
2026. Ahead of these timelines, customers in the U.S. where 
our sales have already been increasing exponentially, are 
expected to start sourcing from alternative suppliers. With 
this, Top Glove as a major glove exporter to the U.S. is 
optimally positioned to capture more market share from the 
trade diversion.
To ensure the Group is well-placed to meet the rapidly 
growing glove demand, installation of advanced production 
lines, which had been temporarily halted due to oversupply, 
will resume at Top Glove’s newer factories. The Group will 
also be ramping up recruitment, towards ensuring it has 
sufficient manpower to support its operations. Nonetheless, 
the Group maintains a cautiously optimistic approach on its 
blueprints for expansion, mindful of the volatile business 
environment which can be affected by geopolitical factors. 
Meanwhile, although the impact from the outbreak of Mpox 
has been minimal as yet, the Group continues to monitor 
developments and is poised to respond in the event of a 
spike in glove demand.
Letter to Stakeholders and 
Management Discussion & Analysis
From reducing environmental impact to enhancing resource 
efficiency to advancing people-first initiatives, we aim to 
create lasting value for all stakeholders. Our focus remains 
on balancing our economic progress with environmental 
stewardship and social responsibility.

efforts, we invite you to refer to the section titled Creating

Integrated Annual Report 2024TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD
The Market and Trends that Shape Us
The expansion of customer segments beyond healthcare professionals has 
broadened market opportunities and driven diversification for the usage of gloves. 
Manufacturers can now tailor gloves to meet the specific needs of various industries 
and personal users. This increased demand for specialised gloves fosters innovation 
in materials, design, and functionality. Manufacturers are developing gloves with 
features like enhanced dexterity, cut resistance, and touchscreen compatibility, 
creating new product niches and catering to evolving user preferences, thereby 
driving growth and expanding market reach7.
To further improve workers’ safety, corporations have implemented the ISO 45001 
occupational health and safety management systems to regulate and improve safety 
in the work environment. For the food and beverage industry, developed countries 
have developed guidelines and recommendations for hygiene purposes by wearing 
gloves to prevent foodborne diseases. Hence, these factors would likely contribute 
to glove demand in the future.
Wider Applications of Gloves Across Industries
Natural rubber latex gloves, being more comfortable and higher dexterity than nitrile 
latex gloves, have been the mainstay for the medical and industrial sectors for some 
years. However, concerns over latex allergies have motivated glove manufacturers 
to improve the performance of their nitrile latex gloves and nowadays, nitrile latex 
gloves are almost as comfortable and permeable as natural rubber latex gloves. 
In addition, nitrile latex gloves can be sterilised without any effect on its physical 
characteristics. Thus, with its excellent performance, many industries have opted for 
nitrile latex gloves.
The rising demand for sustainable and biodegradable gloves also marks a significant 
shift in the global glove industry. With ongoing research, technical advancements, 
and collaborative efforts, these gloves are paving the way for a more environmentally 
friendly future. By embracing this transformation, the industry can reduce its 
ecological impact while ensuring the health and safety of individuals across various 
sectors. This approach not only supports human well-being but also promotes a 
greener planet for future generations8.

The Market and Trends that Shape Us
In 2024, the glove industry continues to evolve, driven by new market demands and shifting global dynamics. The world’s increased 
focus on health, safety, and sustainability has propelled the role of gloves from mere protective equipment to essential tools across 
diverse industries. Gloves have evolved from basic protective gear to versatile products used in diverse industries, including healthcare 
and technology research. We consistently monitor the key trends that have an impact on our long-term business sustainability.
The global COVID-19 pandemic redefined the approach to health and hygiene. 
This heightened awareness around hygiene has reshaped consumer behaviour, as 
well as corporate and governmental policies, with governments globally mandating 
stricter safety regulations. As a result, the demand for gloves remains robust across 
both emerging and developed markets, further amplified by national health budget 
increases.
Emerging markets and developing economies are projected to achieve modest real 
GDP growth of 4.3% in both 2024 and 2025 1. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Rubber 
Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) anticipates that global rubber glove 
demand will rebound, rising to 450 billion pieces by 2027, despite a decline to 307.2 
billion pieces in 20232. The emerging markets, led by strong growth in Asia, particularly 
in China and India, are key drivers of global activity. Increased consumptions in 
these regions, along with robust exports, signals sustained demand for healthcare 
products, including disposable gloves.
Post-Pandemic Shift and Rising Health Standards
Demographic changes, particularly the ageing global population, continue to drive 
demand for healthcare services. According to World Health Organization, by 2050, 
the world’s population aged 60 years and above will double to about 2.1 billion 
people3. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 
years will nearly double from 12% to 22%. Common health conditions are associated 
with ageing as senior population are prone to different diseases and require more 
medical check-ups. The growing ageing population presents new social, economic, 
and health challenges, leading to increased demand for healthcare products and 
services, which in turn is driving higher glove consumption.
Ageing Population and Higher Life Expectancy
According to the IMF 4, global real GDP growth is projected to increase from 3.2 
percent in 2024 to an estimated 3.3 percent in 2025. Meanwhile, global inflation 
is projected to decline, though the pace of disinflation in advanced economies is 
expected to slow in 2024 and 2025 due to persistent service prices and higher 
commodity costs. Gradual cooling in labour markets, alongside falling energy prices, 
is anticipated to bring inflation back to target by the end of 2025.
The Federal Reserve enacted its first interest rate cut since Covid pandemic, 
lowering its key overnight borrowing cost by 50 basis points to a range between 
4.75% to 5% during its September 2024 meeting 5. While the rate cut was widely 
expected, there was speculation that the central bank might opt for a smaller 25 
basis points reduction. Along with the cut, the central bank released new economic 
forecasts, indicating a total of 100 basis points of easing by year-end, implying two 
more 25 basis points cuts in 2024. For 2025, an additional 100 basis points of cuts 
are expected, followed by a final 50 basis points reduction in 20266.

Materiality Assessment 2024Materiality Assessment 2024
All content and data in the Materiality Assessment 2024 section have been verified and assured by the external assessor, SIRIM QAS International Sdn Bhd
A comprehensive materiality assessment will be conducted in Top Glove at least once every four years and every two years for 
minor assessment. 
Materiality Methodology
In April 2024, we conducted a minor materiality assessment to identify and recognise the material matters critical to our 
operations and sustainability initiatives, as raised by our stakeholders. By understanding the concerns and priorities of our 
stakeholders, we can align our goals and targets with these priorities. Through this minor materiality assessment, we have 
identified 16 material matters within our operations, covering environmental, social and governance aspects.
Materiality Assessment Guideline
From stakeholders’ responses, we observed changes in 
priorities compared to the minor materiality assessment 
from FY2022. Product Quality & Safety emerged as the 
top priority for stakeholders, aligning with Top Glove’s 
FY2024 focus on product quality and cost efficiency. 
This alignment reflects the success of our efforts to raise 
stakeholders’ awareness on product quality throughout the 
year. Besides that, we observed increased awareness on 
Supply Chain Management compared to previous years, as 
its importance increases in sustainability matters. Ethics, 
Integrity & Governance along with Occupational Health & 
Safety as well as Customer Experience remain as the top 
5 stakeholder priorities.

Top Glove has strategically realigned its operational priorities 
to advance the ambitious goals outlined in its FY2025 
Sustainability Blueprint, launched in FY2022. This Blueprint 
forms the foundation of our ongoing sustainability journey, 
with a key focus on environmental stewardship and alignment 
with science-based targets.
In response to shifting business dynamics, we have  
re-evaluated and reprioritised our strategies. While we 
recognise the potential for delays in meeting certain 
commitments, our determination to align our corporate 
strategy with science-based targets remains unwavering.
In FY2024, we achieved notable progress by improving 
our Greenhouse Gases (GHG) Emissions calculations, 
incorporating the latest emission factors, and expanding our 
Scope 3 emissions to include purchased goods and services.
In upcoming FY2025, we will evaluate and summarise our 
achievements against the targets outlined in the FY2025 
Sustainability Blueprint. This assessment will offer valuable 
insights into our progress and inform our strategies as we 
move forward. This structured approach will ensure our 
continued efforts on reducing carbon emissions within our 
supply chain and advancing our commitment to sustainability.
Furthermore, we have enhanced our Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) commitments by setting ambitious 
targets for FY2028, in line with our goal of achieving Net Zero 
Carbon by 2050.
In FY2025, we will be publishing the FY2028 Sustainability 
Blueprint, which will serve as a strategic guide for our 
sustainability efforts. This Blueprint has been proposed 
and endorsed by the Board, reflecting our commitment to 
environmental stewardship and sustainable practices. These 
targets include accelerating our carbon reduction initiatives, 
tailored to our business capacity and dynamics. Our efforts 
reflect a deep commitment to our stakeholders, society, and 
the planet, as well as emphasising our dedication to make a 
lasting positive environmental impact.
Our sustainability commitment will be reinforced through 
continuous stakeholder engagements, transparent reporting, 
and the integration of innovative solutions to meet our goals. 
We remain dedicated to driving meaningful change and 
contributing to a sustainable future for all.

Integrated Annual Report 2024TOP GLOVE CORPORATION BHD
Resuming operations after a temporary closure presented the Group with several production challenges, primarily due to 
operational and workforce constraints. Nevertheless, the Group remains committed to being at the forefront of advanced 
technology in the market. Our resilience and adaptability enable us to make consistent progress toward achieving 
operational excellence.
Mitigations
1. Continuously evaluate the effects of technological 
advancements.
2. Formulate contingency plans for various scenarios, 
including potential disruptions due to technological 
disparities.
Opportunities
Operational capabilities and workforce optimisation can 
be achieved through a stable and cost-effective platform.
Operation Risk
As the Group advances its automation and digitalisation initiatives, the integration of production facilities may increase 
complexity and introduce potential vulnerabilities, including data security breaches, operational disruptions, and workforce 
adjustments. These risks could negatively impact the Group’s reputation, operations, and financial performance.
Mitigations
1. The Group’s IT Department continually enhances and 
fortifies its cybersecurity infrastructure.
2. In addition, the IT division remains vigilant in 
monitoring and preempting potential cyber threats.
3. Strategic workforce planning is meticulously aligned 
to reinforce the Group’s long-term growth and 
development initiatives.
Opportunities
Through the adoption of automation and digitalisation, 
the Group enhances efficiency by leveraging technology 
to further automate production lines, reducing reliance on 
manual labour, improving product quality, and lowering 
operational costs.
Information Technology, Digitalisation and Cyber Risk 
Managing Our Risks and Opportunities
The glove manufacturing sector is governed by a range of regulations from various global authorities, including potential 
legislative changes in Malaysia and other countries, as the Group’s products are exported worldwide. Additionally, the 
Group has operational presence in the USA, Brazil, Germany, Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Any failure to comply with 
the relevant laws and regulations in these regions could affect the Group’s financial performance and business outlook, 
while also jeopardising its reputation.
Mitigations
1. A dedicated compliance function has been 
established to provide centralised oversight across 
the Group.
2. The Group’s in-house Legal and Regulatory Affairs 
Departments proactively advise on applicable laws 
and regulatory obligations to ensure full compliance.
3. Thorough regulatory reviews are conducted before 
committing to any new projects.
Opportunities
Compliance with local and international laws ensures 
that the Group meets key regulatory requirements across 
all its operating countries. This safeguards the Group’s 
reputation from potential adverse impacts.
Global Governance Risk
Managing Our Risks and Opportunities
For financial year ended 31 August 2024, the significant risks to the Group are as follows:
In the second half of FY2024, demand surged as customers replenished their stocks after clearing out previous surpluses, 
along with the U.S. decision to raise tariffs on China rubber glove manufacturer. Our Company is well-positioned to meet 
this rising demand by reopening temporarily closed factories and resuming production on previously halted lines. With 
these developments, we anticipate strong performance for the company throughout FY2025.
Mitigations
1. The reopening of temporarily closed factories and 
the ramping up of production lines are underway. 
This strategic move aims to address supply chain 
disruptions and meet the growing demand efficiently.
2. The Group is committed to enhancing its market 
resilience by continuously monitoring industry trends, 
fostering agile response strategies, and cultivating 
strong relationships with stakeholders to remain 
competitive as a key player in the market.
3. A comprehensive strategy for production 
rationalisation and cost management has been 
developed, with the primary goal of ensuring 
smooth operations by reducing waste and improving 
production efficiency.
Opportunities
Sales volume began to rise significantly in FY2024, 
signaling a strong recovery in glove demand as excess 
inventory is depleted. Looking ahead to FY2025, we 
anticipate higher production utilisation, which will 
enhance overall performance. We remain committed to 
meeting global demand.
Business Risk
As demand surged due to customers replenishing their stocks after clearing previous surpluses, combined with the U.S. 
decision to raise tariffs on China rubber glove manufacturers, the Group faces a challenging operational landscape. This 
complexity is compounded by the intricate nature of its manufacturing and supply chain ecosystem, as well as persistent 
issues with high turnover rates and talent retention.
Mitigations
1. The Group’s in-house Legal and Human Resource 
Departments remain vigilant about developments in 
laws and regulations, providing proactive updates to 
ensure compliance with the latest regulatory changes.
2. The Group continuously monitors and enhances its 
labour practices, committing to adhere to the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business & Human 
Rights and the International Labour Organization’s 
best practices to strengthen the resilience of the 
glove industry.
3. A dedicated manpower utilisation plan is regularly 
reviewed to ensure an adequate talent pool to meet 
the Group’s needs.
Opportunities
The Group is committed to regular and continuous 
improvement of labour practices and employee welfare, 
aligning with its dedication to protecting human rights and 
safeguarding employee well-being. We adhere to Human 
Rights & Ethical Conduct standards, including fair and 
ethical labour practices in accordance with the Sedex 
Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) and the Business 
Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) Code of Conduct. 
These standards apply to the Group’s employees, as 
well as our suppliers, business partners, and customers. 
This commitment enhances confidence among existing 
and prospective stakeholders and shareholders in our 
dedication to upholding human rights.

number of local and international suppliers for unique raw materials, especially during periods of material scarcity, poses 
risks of receiving subpar quality goods and experiencing shortages.
Additionally, increasing scrutiny on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) matters requires the Group to navigate 
a more stringent supplier selection process to meet ESG standards at a sustainable cost. As a natural rubber latex 
manufacturer based in Thailand, the Group also faces the risk of non-compliance with the EU Deforestation Regulation 
(EUDR), which aims to protect natural forests and biodiversity.
Moreover, there is growing scrutiny of the Group’s environmental practices, including water consumption, energy usage, 
effluent and emission discharge, and other climate-related risks.
Mitigations
1. The Group remains committed to actively sourcing 
alternative materials and suppliers to ensure a 
consistent supply chain, preparing well in advance to 
mitigate short-term disruptions.
2. The Group has also explored potential alternative 
sources or substitutes for materials that are in limited 
supply.
3. To address supply chain disruptions, the Group has 
diversified into multiple upstream business units, 
including chemical, former, latex, and packaging 
material production.
4. The Group integrates its ESG framework into business 
operations and conducts regular due diligence on key 
suppliers, adhering to a wide range of standards.
5. The Board Sustainability Committee oversees 
the Group’s sustainability initiatives, guiding ESG 
strategies to create a competitive advantage and 
generate long-term value for stakeholder.
Opportunities
The Group is dedicated to localising its supply chains 
by prioritising local and Asian vendors for raw material 
sourcing whenever feasible, which may indirectly boost 
domestic and regional economic growth. To support good 
governance and sustainability, the Group is committed to 
partnering with vendors who are transparent, ethical, and 
socially and environmentally responsible. Additionally, 
the Group regularly monitors changes in regulatory 
requirements to ensure compliance and provide 
reasonable assurance that it aligns with environmental 
and social standards in all operating countries.
Sustainability Risk
Considering its export-oriented manufacturing focus, the Group’s financial performance is vulnerable to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in commodity prices, particularly for essential raw materials such as natural 
rubber and nitrile latex. Changes in key currencies like the U.S. Dollar and related commodity prices can affect the Group’s 
financial results in the short-term due to the lag in the cost pass-through mechanism. Furthermore, broader inflationary 
pressures could increase production costs and potentially lead to further margin compression in the near term.
Mitigations
1. The Group continuously monitors risk factors and 
strives to implement an effective cost pass-through 
mechanism to minimise the impact of macroeconomic 
factors on financial performance.
2. The Group has undertaken cost reduction and 
avoidance initiatives to enhance operational efficiency 
and maintain a healthy cash flow.
Opportunities
A well-structured capital framework will enable the Group 
to manage its funds effectively, boost market value, and 
minimise the cost of capital.

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL 
DISCLOSURES (TCFD)
As we continue our journey with TCFD disclosures, which 
began in FY2022, we are committed to providing a continuous 
and quantitative assessment of our climate-related risks and 
opportunities. This approach enhances both our environmental 
responsibility and financial transparency, with detailed findings 
available in our FY2024 Sustainability Report. Additionally, we 
are integrating International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) S1 and S2, ensuring alignment with global reporting 
norms. These efforts reflect our dedication to meeting 
international standards, advancing sustainability, and 
addressing the evolving expectations of our stakeholders.
FY2024 Highlights

MOVING FORWARD
In FY2024, we took a significant step forward in preparing for 
the integration of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) with the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This integration will enhance 
our reporting on nature-related risks, such as water and air 
pollution, by adopting the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, 
and Prepare) approach. By using this structured framework, 
we aim to systematically identify, evaluate, and mitigate nature 
risks. We are adopting TNFD and planning to disclose the TNFD 
reporting by 2025, further demonstrating our commitment to 
transparent and comprehensive sustainability practices.
