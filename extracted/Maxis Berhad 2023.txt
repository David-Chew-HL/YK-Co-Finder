# LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

# FOCUS ON THE ESSENTIALS

# LEVERAGE ON OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN CONNECTIVITY TO DELIVER ENDURING VALUE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS

DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

In 2023, we faced several macroeconomic challenges, such as inflation affecting operational costs and high interest rates. Malaysia’s growth slowed, weighed down by weak global demand and high global interest rates. We had to navigate the fast-changing telecommunications sector landscape, which included regulatory changes to the 5G network model and service pricing, a mobile market that is near saturation, shifts in consumers’ needs, as well as the consolidation of key players.

|Total Dividend Payout|RM1.25 billion|

|In response to these challenges posed by the uncertain and volatile operating landscape, we have gone back to basics and strengthened our core competencies in connectivity. This realignment is essential to achieve our goals and remain at the forefront as Malaysia’s leading integrated telco.|In response to these challenges posed by the uncertain and volatile operating landscape, we have gone back to basics and strengthened our core competencies in connectivity.

|The Board has declared a total dividend of 16 sen per share with a total payout of RM1.25 billion for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.|Whilst we are encouraged by our management’s performance, we have taken a prudent stance to reduce the dividend per share from 20 sen per share in 2022 given the aforementioned challenges. This is to ensure that Maxis continues to be resilient and consistent in delivering value to our stakeholders in the short- and long-term.|
|Continue to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value and returns|We value the long-standing support received from our shareholders and are confident that Maxis will continue to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value and returns.|

# KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

Maxis has always taken pride in providing quality services to our customers. We are also committed to supporting the nation’s digital ambitions by making connectivity accessible and affordable for the rakyat. Our focus on our core business areas – Mobile, Fibre and Enterprise – is designed to strengthen our foothold in a fiercely competitive telco sector.

This year, we refreshed our consumer mobile service offerings with new postpaid plans to take advantage of our 5G network as well as high-speed fibre plans to enhance connectivity for our customers. In the enterprise space, we continued to serve a growing number of businesses and forged new strategic partnerships to deliver cutting-edge and comprehensive enterprise solutions.

The collective effort across our businesses to establish Maxis as the leading integrated telco in Malaysia has shown tangible results in 2023 as we met the key financial performance targets we had set for ourselves, which in turn met the guidance provided to our stakeholders.
# LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS

# UPHOLDING GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

We are steadfast in upholding the principles of good corporate governance, recognising its fundamental importance in achieving sustainable business success and creating value for our shareholders. At Maxis Group, we operate with the highest ethical standards, adhering strictly to anti-corruption laws, policies, and regulations. Our commitment to these standards is articulated through our Maxis Integrity & Compliance framework (MICF) and our Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financial Terrorism (AML/CFT) initiatives. The Board members are also assessed based on the Maxis Anti-Bribery and Corruption system in adherence with good corporate governance practices. These frameworks and system guide our actions and ensure that we maintain the highest level of integrity across all our operations.

Another key aspect of our governance is the composition and diversity of our Board. The Board’s varied expertise, skills, and independence are pivotal in governing the Company effectively. Our Board members bring a wealth of diverse experiences and perspectives, enabling the Maxis Group to navigate the complex business landscape confidently and ethically. This diversity is not just a matter of policy but a strategic imperative that drives our decision-making processes, ensuring that we operate with integrity and responsibility.

# STRENGTHENING SUSTAINABILITY PRACTICES

The Maxis Group continued to demonstrate our pledge to operating a sustainable business whilst delivering value to all our stakeholders. In 2023, we updated key policies such as the Code of Business Practice to include our commitment towards promoting sustainable practices, which apply to both Maxis’ employees and third parties that engage with Maxis.

The Maxis Group has also been a leading player in the Malaysian telecommunications industry with respect to supporting the transition to a lower carbon footprint and adopting clean energy solutions. We have transitioned a portion of our fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) in our field operations. Furthermore, our Subang Hi-Tech operations centre is the first telco network site in Malaysia to be awarded the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems certification by SIRIM QAS International. We take pride in sharing this accomplishment, highlighting our dedication and commitment towards sustainable operations and environmental management.

Lastly, our eKelas® programme continues to be an integral part of the Ministry of Education’s Digital Educational Learning Initiative, with a reach of over 600 schools across the nation. This initiative has greatly benefited students, teachers, and guardians who have been able to access a wide range of free learning content, which serves as a testament to our dedication to societal advancement and reflects our deep-rooted commitment to making a positive impact in the communities we serve.

# OUTLOOK

Malaysia’s economic growth in 2024 is expected to trend higher1, within the region of 4-5% driven by domestic2 spending, improvement in external demand in addition to infrastructure projects and implementation of strategic initiatives by the Government. The International Monetary Fund is projecting a rebound in global trade growth from 0.4% in 2023 to 3.3% in 20241.

We are cognisant of the challenges and potential upside that may arise this year and look forward to unlocking beneficial opportunities that come our way. We will continue to prioritise our focus on our core competencies in Mobile, Fibre and Enterprise. Customer experience is at the heart of our operations, and we are committed to understanding and adapting to our customers’ evolving needs. Our initiatives to drive operational efficiency and strict cost discipline will ensure sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our thanks to the Maxis management team and all employees for their steadfast dedication and resilience. Your consistent efforts and commitment have played a significant role in maintaining our success, especially in challenging times.

We also extend our appreciation to our business partners, vendors and regulators for their support in Maxis’ growth journey as the leading integrated telco in Malaysia. Your contributions are significant and important to our ongoing progress and success. We look forward to a successful 2024.

TAN SRI MOKHZANI BIN MAHATHIR

Another key environmental initiative this year was our e-waste management campaign in Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru and Penang. This programme focuses on mobile device collection and recycling, and we have successfully contributed to the refurbishment or recycling of over 49,000 devices, reducing the number of technology devices that contain toxic components from ending up in landfills.

# LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS

# CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT

# FOCUSING ON OUR CORE BUSINESSES FOR STABLE AND CONSISTENT GROWTH

Maxis’ performance in 2023 is evidence of our strategy to focus on our core businesses in Mobile, Fibre and Enterprise as the leading integrated telco in Malaysia. As I complete my first year leading Maxis, I am pleased to share our 2023 results and outlook for 2024.

# SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS GROWTH

The Malaysian telecommunications industry experienced many interesting developments and challenges in 2023. The industry underwent partial consolidation with the merger of two large players. There were changes in the regulatory environment to promote network competition and affordable connectivity to all, while rising costs and macroeconomic challenges continue to affect Malaysia. In addition, consumers’ digital lifestyles continue to advance rapidly and drive a seemingly insatiable demand for data. The average data consumption from our customers has increased by 2½ times in the past five years, from 10.9GB per month in 2018 to 27.8GB per month in 2023.

|Service Revenue|RM8.57 billion|Highest in five years|
|---|---|---|
|EBITDA|RM3.96 billion|Highest in five years|

The fast-changing operating environment reaffirmed our belief that to strengthen our position as Malaysia’s leading integrated telco, we must excel in delivering our three core offerings - Mobile, Fibre and Enterprise. We introduced innovative product offerings tailored to diverse market segments via our Maxis and Hotlink dual-brand strategy. These included Postpaid and Prepaid plans with combined access to 4G and 5G. We also offered high-speed fibre broadband plans of up to 2Gbps to households across the country. In addition, we grew our enterprise business by anticipating and meeting the connectivity and ICT needs of our corporate and public sector customers, highlighted by our deals with BHPetrol and Johor Plantations Berhad to provide Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) services.

As a result, total revenue for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 was RM10.18 billion, a 4% growth from 2022. Our service revenue of RM8.57 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of RM3.96 billion were the highest recorded in the past five years. I am especially pleased with our EBITDA results given the rising cost pressures and the aforementioned exponential growth in demand for data.

To ensure our long-term growth and prosperity, we have taken a disciplined and strategic approach to our capital expenditure (CAPEX). We targeted our RM813 million investment to enhance our mobile network capacity, grow our own fibre-to-the-premise footprint, and improve digitalisation across our Company. At the end of 2023, Maxis has more than 11,000 LTE sites in Malaysia covering 95% of the population and connected an additional 181,000 premises with our own fibre infrastructure.
# LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# CUSTOMER CENTRIC ENGAGEMENTS

At Maxis, we have always prioritised customer experience as it is a key differentiator in a hyper-competitive market. We continue to record a high touchpoint net promoter score (TP-NPS) of +68, thanks to the loyalty of our customers and their satisfaction with our products and services.

# DIFFERENTIATED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

Simple and pleasant customer experience: Self-service of basic transactions and troubleshoot of home fibre network via Maxis App and MaxBot.

We believe that the best customer experience is one where we make all our processes and procedures simple for them. To that end, we have improved our Maxis and Hotlink Apps so that features such as plan upgrades, device purchases, roaming passes, and credit top-ups can be completed with as few clicks as possible. We also focused our effort on digitalising customer interactions to ensure faster, more accessible, and reliable service. Beyond our traditional voice contact centres, our customers can now reach us via WhatsApp, web self-service, and through our apps. In our fibre broadband business, we invested to increase our pool of WiFi-certified Maxperts to serve our growing fibre customers in a timely and “first-time right” manner.

# OPERATING EXCELLENCE

To deliver sustainable business growth, we are committed to a culture of operating excellence where we focus on executing well and simplifying processes while maintaining strict cost discipline. In 2023, we embarked on a three-year cost optimisation programme focused on rightsizing the organisation. It is critical for us to rebase our costs so that we are well-positioned for future opportunities.

BUILT AGILE & COMPETENT DIGITAL TALENT

&gt;2,500 employees trained: Skill development in areas of Digital Platform, Robotic Process Automation, Data Science and Analytics, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Cybersecurity.

# OUTLOOK AND PRIORITIES FOR 2024

Looking ahead to 2024, I am highly confident that Maxis will strengthen its position as Malaysia’s leading integrated telco. We will focus on growing our core businesses—Mobile, Fibre, and Enterprise—while delivering operating excellence. We will continue to develop the deep insights required to understand our customers and their needs, and to focus on simplicity to provide customers with the easiest and best experience at any of our touch points.

Our long-term goal remains firmly set on sustainable and predictable business growth. Despite the intensifying competition and ever-changing regulatory landscape, we are confident that our agility and fast response allow us to seize opportunities that may arise from these developments.

# DIGITAL INITIATIVES IN 2023

# IMPROVED EFFICIENCIES & PRODUCTIVITY

Digital customers onboarding: Enabled 5G activation and change of rate plans through the Maxis App.

# PERSONALISED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH ADVANCED ANALYTICS & MACHINE LEARNING

Personalised product offerings for customers: Built a unified 360-degree customer view and fuelled recommendation engines to predict customer satisfaction.

# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I would like to extend my gratitude to all our stakeholders who have contributed to Maxis’ success. I want to thank our staff members for their diligence, resilience, and commitment throughout a challenging and interesting year. I would also like to express my equal appreciation to our shareholders, customers, partners and the communities we serve, live and work in. Thank you for your trust and belief in Maxis. I look forward to working with you as we pursue our goals and aspirations.

# LEADERSHIP STATEMENTS

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

Maxis delivered a solid performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (FY2023). We recorded our highest service revenue and EBITDA in five years. The Company saw strong growth across our consumer and enterprise businesses, underpinned by our strategy to focus on core competencies in connectivity to remain as Malaysia’s leading integrated telco.

# REVENUE

The postpaid segment revenue experienced a 7.5% growth compared to FY2022, while our prepaid segment revenue declined slightly by 2.7%. The prepaid market continues to be competitive and challenging. We have actively transitioned our prepaid customers to postpaid plans to enhance customer loyalty and secure more predictable and sustainable revenue growth.

Notwithstanding our prepaid to postpaid migration, we are encouraged by the growth in prepaid subscribers by 1.6% year-on-year to 5.87 million subscribers. We have actively expanded our Hotlink presence in key focus areas such as the youth segment, and under-indexed markets.

|Revenue|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Service Revenue|8,336|8,572|
|Device Revenue|1,453|1,608|
|Total Revenue (RM million)|9,789|10,180|

Maxis’ total revenue grew by 4.0% to RM10.18 billion for FY2023, the highest since the Company was listed in 2009. The revenue growth was driven by the growth of service revenue by 2.8% to RM8.57 billion, and device revenue growth of 10.7% to RM1.61 billion. Service revenue was the highest in five years and contributed across the board by the growth in our consumer mobile and home connectivity segments, as well as the enterprise business.

# CONSUMER REVENUE

Our consumer business recorded a steady growth of 3.7% from the RM6.81 billion recorded in the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (FY2022), driven by the launch of our 5G plans and innovative postpaid and fibre convergence plans that provide seamless connectivity across both wireless and wired networks.

|Consumer Revenue (RM million)|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|
|Consumer Postpaid|3,520|3,275|
|Consumer Prepaid|2,693|2,619|
|Consumer Home Connectivity|7,064|1,508|

# ENTERPRISE REVENUE

Maxis' Enterprise division also continued to make strong headway, recording a revenue growth of 6.4% (excluding wholesale voice) in FY2023 in comparison to FY2022. We secured multi-year connectivity and solution contracts across key markets including wholesale, SME, corporate and public sector accounts during the year under review. A key highlight was our appointment by Telekom Malaysia to provide 4G Multi Operator Core Network (MOCN) and domestic roaming services for 2G and 4G. We will provide approximately 6,800 sites for the 4G MOCN and domestic roaming services and 10,000 sites for the 2G domestic roaming services.

|---|---|---|---|
|2023:|3,960|27.0%|813|
|2022:|3,929| |1,114|

# EBIT

In 2023, we looked at simplifying processes and renegotiating contracts to maximise operational efficiencies with the objective to cultivate a culture of strict cost discipline throughout the organisation. In line with this, we commenced a cost optimisation exercise to rightsize the organisation. As a result, Maxis recorded EBITDA of RM3.96 billion, up by 0.8% compared to FY2022, and our highest in five years. Maxis invested RM813 million in CAPEX in 2023, 27% lower against FY2022 and accounting for 8% of our total revenue. We have been prudent in our investments in view of industry developments including changes to the 5G network model. Whilst we continued to spend on network-related investments, our investments were focused on supporting network capacity growth and fibre builds.

# Profit After Tax (PAT)

|---|---|---|---|
|2023:|1,353|3.0%|9,203|
|2022:|1,313| |9,237|

Maxis' PAT in FY2023 was RM992 million, which was lower than our FY2022 PAT of RM1.15 billion. The results were impacted by one-off items such as the depreciation acceleration, write-offs of assets and one-off tax settlement in FY2023, as well as the prosperity tax in FY2022. Excluding these one-off items, the adjusted PAT in FY2023 was RM1.35 billion and 3.0% higher than in FY2022.

# Dividend Policy

Our full dividend policy, as stated in our IPO Prospectus dated 28 October 2009, is reproduced here for reference: their engagement efforts to cultivate strong relationships with shareholders, potential investors and other stakeholders. We pride ourselves in consistently maintaining a direct and open communication with our stakeholders and keep the market informed of all information which may have a material impact on our share price.

“The declaration of interim dividends and the recommendation of final dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board and any final dividend for the year is subject to shareholders’ approval. It is the Company’s intention to pay dividends to shareholders in the future. However, such payments will depend upon a number of factors, including Maxis’ earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, the Company’s distributable reserves and other factors considered relevant by the Board.

Maxis intends to adopt a dividend policy of active capital management. The Company proposes to pay dividends out of cash generated by its operations after setting aside necessary funding for network expansion and improvement and working capital needs. As part of this policy, the Company targets a payout ratio of not less than 75% of its consolidated PAT under the Malaysian Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAP) in each calendar year, beginning the financial year ended 31 December 2010, subject to confirmation of the Board and to any applicable law, license and contractual obligations and provided that such distribution would not be detrimental to its cash needs or to any plans approved by its Board. Investors should note that this dividend policy merely describes the Company’s present intention and shall not constitute legally binding statements in respect of the Company’s future dividends which are subject to modification (including reduction or non-declaration thereof) at the Board’s discretion.”

# HOW WE CREATE VALUE

# OUR VALUE CREATION MODEL

# TRADE-OFFS

|Financial Capital|Manufactured Capital|
|---|---|
|We aim to achieve a balance between short-term financial interests, rewarding our shareholders and longer-term growth objectives. In preparing ourselves for the uncertainty related to the potential second 5G network, there is a need to ensure that we are prudent with our CAPEX spending and focus on selected investments so that customers’ experience will not be affected. Cashflow position for FY2023 was impacted by higher overall tax payments, prepayment to Digital Nasional Berhad (DNB) for 5G access and staff optimisation costs. Excluding these one-off costs, we could have potentially rewarded our stakeholders where applicable.| |
|We have embarked on our three-year cost optimisation journey to optimise and reduce our cost base. The first stage focused on staff rightsizing, followed by improvements in processes and systems to be more cost-efficient. There is also a need to have sufficient credit lines to manage unforeseen requirements in our operations and the environment. These initiatives are expected to generate shareholders value in the long run.| |
|Our annual CAPEX and maintenance spend impact our near-term Financial Capital but enables us to expand our capacity and capabilities that will help to replenish our Financial Capital and generate significant long-term value.| |
|Additionally, allocating Financial Capital towards Manufactured Capital will also help strengthen our customer relationships and improve our position in the market especially since we provide improved plans, better products and services, as well as enhanced connectivity.| |

# Intellectual Capital

Investments of Financial Capital into Intellectual Capital initiatives such as improving our digital infrastructure and operations are weighed against our financial and risk management priorities. We believe that these investments are crucial for delivering exceptional customer service whilst maintaining competitiveness in a demanding market.

# Human Capital

# Social & Relationship Capital

We prioritise our employees by investing in their development to ensure they are prepared for the future. While these investments may impact our near-term Financial Capital, they ultimately lead to more productive and higher performing employees, strengthening our Human Capital and creating long-term value for Maxis Group.

We are also aware of the current headwinds in the operating environment and the need to optimise cost for the benefit of the Group’s future growth. Our decision to undertake a staff optimisation exercise is anticipated to support our Financial Capital in the long run, with the expectation of higher savings so that the excess can be allocated to other high-priority areas.

We enhanced our community engagement efforts by investing both Financial and Human Capitals in local community projects and social initiatives, which may not yield immediate financial returns. This strategic choice might divert resources from other areas with direct financial benefits. However, by strengthening community relations and building trust, we are enhancing brand reputation, customer loyalty, and our social license to operate, thereby creating long-term value for both Maxis Group and our stakeholders.

# Natural Capital

We are committed to driving sustainable value and initiatives for the sustainability of the business and organisation in the long run. This is important for our future generation, in line with Malaysia’s undertaking to achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2050. While implementing these require additional Financial Capital, we are confident that it will ultimately minimise future carbon costs and contribute to our long-term sustainability and Natural Capital effect.

# HOW WE CREATE VALUE

# OUR TOP MATERIAL MATTERS

At Maxis, our material matters are crucial as they enable us to focus our efforts on the most significant economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) impacts related to our operations. This approach not only aligns with stakeholders' expectations but also enhances transparency and accountability. By addressing these key areas, we can effectively manage risks, capitalise on growth opportunities and make positive contributions to sustainable development, thereby bolstering our reputation and competitive edge in the marketplace.

Our material matters are determined through comprehensive materiality assessments, involving both internal and external stakeholders to gain valuable insights into the sustainability issues that are important to our Company and stakeholders. Our approach involves evaluating and prioritising material topics based on their impact and importance to our business and stakeholders. This enables us to focus our resources and initiatives to address the most crucial aspects of sustainability.

# Our materiality assessment process is depicted below:

|Phase 1:|Define Purpose and Scope|Phase 2:|Identify Potential Topics|Phase 3:|Categorise|Phase 4:|Gather Information About the Impact and Importance of Topics|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Define what materiality means for the organisation while considering the target audience and objectives|Create an extensive list of potential material topics relevant to the organisation|Refine the list of potential material topics by clustering them into categories|Explore each material topic in detail to understand its relevance to the organisation and its stakeholders| | | | |
|Phase 5:|Prioritise|Phase 6:|Engage Management|Phase 7:|Seek Stakeholder Feedback| | |
|Prioritise material topics based on the strategic importance to the business, stakeholders and the social, economic and environmental impact of each topic in the value chain|Test the results of the materiality assessment with key internal audiences to validate the outcome|Follow up with stakeholders to get feedback on the material topics reported| | | | | |

In 2023, we conducted a desktop validation exercise to ensure that our material matters were relevant and aligned with our current business needs and stakeholders’ expectations. This process involved aligning our material matters against those of our peers as well as local and international frameworks, including Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Guide (3rd Edition), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, Global Reporting Initiative Standards and the 2023 update of the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) material sustainability issues for the mobile sector.
# HOW WE CREATE VALUE

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

Following the validation exercise, we found that our existing material matters remained relevant. We conducted an impact assessment workshop on 8 February 2024 to re-evaluate the impact of these identified material matters to our business, while maintaining the stakeholders' perspectives obtained in 2021. This workshop involved ten senior management personnel from Maxis who deliberated and provided feedback on the impact of the identified material matters. These material matters were ranked according to their significance, as illustrated below:

# MATERIALITY MATRIX

|Low|Medium|High| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Significance of Maxis’ EESG Impacts|Data Privacy & Protection|Ethical Business Practice| | |
|Network Quality & Coverage|Customer Experience & Satisfaction|Regulatory Compliance|Equal Opportunity Workforce|Employee Development & Employment|
|Sustainable Business Growth|Digital Inclusion & Innovation|Occupational Health & Safety|Crisis Management & Response|Climate Change|
|Environmental Management|Supply Chain Management|Community Development| | |

All material matters were ranked in terms of their significance, ranging from High to Low Importance. Data Privacy & Protection, Network Quality & Coverage and Customer Experience & Satisfaction remain as the top three matters that are material to Maxis as they were considered critical to our business and stakeholders.

As the competitive landscape evolves and sustainability considerations become increasingly relevant, Sustainable Business Growth increased in importance, and emerged as a critical factor in maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring business sustainability. Similarly, Crisis Management & Response and Regulatory Compliance rose in positioning compared to the impact assessment conducted in 2021, as they are highly relevant to Maxis to ensure business continuity. Due to the change of material matters mentioned, Ethical Business Practice and Digital Inclusion & Innovation dropped in rankings indicating that there is an increased focus to ensure compliance, business growth and customer satisfaction.

Climate Change has shifted downwards in the Medium Importance ranking reflecting the industry’s sentiment within the telecommunications sector, where Climate Change is reflected in their 2022 IAR and sustainability reports. This is also aligned with the industry’s short-term operational focus as climate change is often viewed as a long-term concern with uncertainties. Nevertheless, Maxis continues to actively implement various initiatives to manage energy consumption and GHG emissions, which includes solar energy systems, energy optimisation initiatives and modernisation of equipment.

These adjustments were necessary to refine our focus on aspects crucial for our business objectives, ensuring business sustainability, business growth, regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction. Regardless of the adjustments, all identified matters by Maxis are considered EESG risks to the Company. Lower-ranked issues are typically addressed through rigorous controls and risk assessments. We expect to conduct frequent reviews of our materiality matrix in response to changes within the operational landscape and will continue to monitor and evaluate all material matters to ensure their relevance to our strategic priorities and dynamic business environment.

# Personalised Customer Experience through Advanced Analytics & Machine Learning

# OUR NETWORK

# Smart investment in expanding our leading converged network to serve more Malaysians

In 2023, we continued to strategically expand our mobile coverage footprint in Malaysia to better serve all Malaysians. We built more than 700 new sites in 2023, especially in the East Coast, Sabah and Sarawak, mostly supporting 4G coverage expansion for underserved areas. The activation of more LTE sites on 900MHz frequency has also allowed us to expand our existing coverage reach and indoor/in-building quality signal.

Maxis is also working closely with the industry to actively share more than 2,400 sites providing additional coverage to rural and underserved areas. This is expected to grow by an additional 2,000 sites in 2024 and 2025 under the Jendela Phase 1 and other Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission's (MCMC) Universal Service Provision (USP) related programme.

# Optimised a Converged Network Experience

In 2023, we continued to ensure that our customer experience remains consistent wherever they may be, with our speed test samples achieving more than 3Mbps more than 95% of the time. This allows our customers to experience consistent and uninterrupted connectivity, seamless website streaming as well as smooth high-definition video experience. The activation of more LTE sites on 900MHz frequency in 2023 has also allowed us to expand our coverage and reach. Additional measures which include the upgrade of 4G radio access network, deployment of advanced high-speed microwave and strengthening of fibre network architecture to enhance network resiliency, resulted in network speed and stability improvement.

Since the launch of the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over WiFi (VoWIFI), more than 80% of our voice traffic is carried over these technologies. This translates to more than 33 million daily high-definition voice calls made by customers, enjoying faster call setup times, better voice clarity, and robust and uninterrupted connectivity.

From our partnerships with technology companies in business intelligence and workforce precision upskilling, we have accelerated the use of machine learning and analytics in enabling Maxis to be an insight-driven organisation.

We built a unified 360-degree customer view that allows us to predict individual customer satisfaction based on algorithms and provide personalised recommendations to our customers.

# Continued to Enhance the Network and Explore New Technologies

Maxis has been at the forefront of exploring cutting-edge network technologies to meet the evolving demands of data consumption and the exponential growth in traffic. On average, Maxis’ customers consume over 30GB of data per month. Top consumption drivers include video streaming, social networking and web browsing, with a combined volume of almost 180,000 Terabytes.

# New Spectrum Bandwidths

In June 2023, Maxis became the first telecommunications company in the Asia-Pacific region to successfully conduct a technical field trial with the trial of the 6GHz spectrum, leveraging advanced massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology. The trial, conducted in Kuala Lumpur, aimed to assess the feasibility of integrating this new spectrum and antenna technology to address the escalating demand for mobile traffic and enhance coverage in urban environments.

# Optimising Existing Network Performance

In a continuous effort to optimise existing network performance, Maxis has implemented advanced features utilising AI algorithms and ultra-low latency scheduling. These features enhance network capacity and improve the user experience. Maxis has focused on delivering consistency between the 4G and 5G networks through optimisation, enhanced capability, and proactive issue resolution. Various initiatives, including a nationwide rollout of LTE 900MHz on 85% of sites, have significantly enhanced indoor coverage and improved the 4G user experience.

Maxis has deployed advanced solutions for improved network capacity and efficiency which resulted in a significant improvement in user experience and notable power savings.

This includes an immersive attachment where these graduates assimilated with Maxis retail stores and contact centres' products, services, customer service and operations.

Each graduate will undertake a one-year rotational programme in their respective business areas, ensuring comprehensive exposure to business needs, operations and offerings.

# Empowering Internal Talent

At Maxis, our commitment to foster professional growth encompasses both vertical and horizontal career advancements through our IGrow policies. Reflecting on the past year, we are proud to deploy initiatives to empower our employees to take ownership of their careers and evolve alongside our Company. Demonstrating our commitment to talent mobility, 18% or 687 of our employees underwent job rotations or horizontal movements in 2023.

In addition, we hosted IGrow Day – an event to guide our employees in exploring career development opportunities within Maxis. The event featured exhibition booths managed by the respective People & Organisation (P&O) COEs, fireside chats and panel discussions, where Senior Leaders shared their growth experiences.

During IGrow Day, we introduced a new platform, Opportunity Marketplace, offering employees the chance to engage in Gig Project Opportunities within or outside their divisions. The Gig Project concept serves as a platform for building new experiences and skills, with 96 employees participating in Gig Projects, completing 15 projects to date.

From a talent acquisition standpoint, our team has prioritised internal employee applications for business stakeholders, creating opportunities within the organisation. The #AskRecruiter sessions facilitated this process, resulting in 46 internal job transfers, constituting 13% of the total hiring by the Talent Acquisition team in 2023. In conclusion, these programmes navigate the evolving talent landscape by emphasising cross-divisional learning to retain talent. We believe that providing growth opportunities enhances talent mobility, ensuring engagement through on-the-job learning and future-proofing our organisation.

We prioritise the health and well-being of our talents to help them achieve their optimum potential and enhance productivity at work by introducing Mental Health Resilience Toolkits under Maxis P.O.S.I.T.I.V.E to support employee well-being and resilience. This initiative aims to help employees stay agile and better cope with life’s challenges, both at home and in the workplace.

In our commitment to fostering an agile and high-performing culture, coupled with an effective performance management process system, we optimised our framework and methodology to drive productivity and performance for a sustainable and impactful outcome at Maxis.

# Building Agile and Competent Digital Talent

Our people are vital contributors and are our biggest asset, playing a crucial role in enabling all our value creation activities. We are proud that Maxis today is powered by over 3,700 driven and passionate industry experts, an inclusive and diverse workforce in gender, age, ethnicity, and experience, reflective of the multitude of customers we serve. We have enabled our people by providing state-of-the-art digital tools to maximise their productivity and effectiveness.

In Maxis, we embrace the principle that collaboration fuels innovation and will continue to work closely with major players in the digital, data and cloud industry such as AWS, Google, and Microsoft to name a few. This enables our people to be exposed to best-in-class global practices and skills development in the areas of Digital Platforms, Robotic Process Automation, Data Science and Analytics, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Cybersecurity, as these are areas that we have identified as important for the sustainability of our organisation.

# Engaging the Best Talent in their Fields

In the past year, we focused on enhancing employee engagement, celebrating unique festive seasons and fostering connections through activities such as Maxis Sports Day, the #lifeatmaxis eSports Tournament, KL City Tour Challenge, Maxis Treasure Hunt and #Recharge – Grand Prix Showdown. We continue to prioritise upskilling our talents with digital skills and instilling a digital innovation culture through hackathons, fostering agile ways of working and collaboration.

# EQUAL OPPORTUNITY WORKFORCE & EMPLOYMENT

We also started welcoming employees to Return-to-Office full time with the implementation of Flexible Start-of-Work time to enable flexibility in working hours and prioritise productivity. Over the past two years, we have ingrained a culture of taking time off for rest and rejuvenation. Employees are given the freedom to choose when to enjoy a minimum of five consecutive working days of Block Leave per calendar year.

We comply with all local laws and regulations in safeguarding our stakeholders. Rooted in international standards, our Code of Business Practice addresses industry-specific exposures. We believe it is our responsibility to adopt grievance mechanisms, conduct due diligence and communicate expectations to personnel and third parties.
# OUR VALUE CREATION OUTCOME

# DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE VALUE

At Maxis, we firmly believe in upholding the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility and ethical business practices, we have established robust policies aimed at preventing human rights violations within our operations and supply chain and at the same time, providing a safe space for employees to come forward in ensuring a secure workspace.

By upholding strong policies and our zero-tolerance stance to prioritise the wellbeing and safety of our workforce, we are not only fulfilling our ethical responsibilities as a corporate citizen but also contributing to the long-term success and sustainability of our business.

Maxis goes beyond embracing the concept of equal employment opportunities, we actively turn it into a reality. Initiatives such as employee resource groups, including ‘Women at Maxis’ and ‘Youth at Maxis’, serve as dynamic platforms for employees to connect, exchange experiences and actively participate in the ongoing dialogue about inclusivity. The ‘Women@Maxis Mentoring Programme’ which was launched in November 2023, further underscores professional growth for women at Maxis.

In our commitment to foster an inclusive workplace, we organised Diversity Day to engage employees in workshops, fun activities, raising awareness on diversity and inclusion. These initiatives aim to facilitate mutual learning and fortify the bonds that unite us as a cohesive team. Additionally, Maxis participates in external events such as Girls in Tech Conference and Women Who Code, contributing to the broader conversation on equality.

Maxis is steadfast in its commitment to nurture a diverse workplace that reflects the richness of human experience. The journey towards equality is continuous, driven by the belief that strength lies in diversity, promoting continuous success and fostering an environment where all individuals can thrive. We believe in advancing progress, innovation and shaping a future that values the uniqueness of every individual.

# Upholding Human Rights

In addition, we strive to protect and respect the rights of all our employees, providing a platform for employees to report complaints on human rights violations, including instances of discrimination, harassment and bullying in the workplace. Employees are encouraged to report such cases to managers, the human resource team, whistleblowing channels or directly to the compliance team, without fear of retaliation or reprisal. In 2023, one case of human rights violation was recorded which resulted in termination of employment. Maxis practices zero tolerance to human rights violation wherein all reported cases are thoroughly investigated and appropriate measures were taken to resolve these issues in compliance with the Malaysian laws and best practices. In the following years, we intend to enhance assessment and reporting of human rights violations across our supply chain.

At Maxis, the health and safety of our workforce is vital. We comply with all local laws and regulations in safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and customers. We maintain industry standard operating guidelines, set strict targets to reduce health and safety incidents and conduct health and safety audits regularly. To this end, we strictly adhere to stringent Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) policies and protocols overseen by the dedicated HSE department. This department actively collaborates with stakeholders, managing all aspects of occupational health and safety. Furthermore, comprehensive quarterly reports are submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC).

|Completion of the at-risk employees who registered to undergo HSE specialised high-risk training plan sessions|(100%)|(100%)|(100%)|

To ensure the safety of our team and to protect them from hazards in the workplace, employees underwent training to develop skills related to the HSE. This encompassed Defensive Driving Training (DDT), Working-At-Heights (WAH), Basic Fire Fighting, Occupational First Aid, Cardio-pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) usage.

As our operations span across diverse locations, it is essential to equip employees with occupational first aid expertise. Apart from general first aid skills, designated personnel at field and selected office sites received training in using AEDs and administering basic first aid responses for effective emergency response. For those working on towers and rooftops, the WAH training provided employees with safe work techniques, covering aspects such as safe climbing and work practices.

Field team members who frequently travel to sites for work, underwent DDT to enhance their skills and awareness. This training promotes safe and responsible driving practices, instilling a proactive mindset in drivers, emphasising strategies to avoid collisions, handle adverse conditions and make informed decisions on the road.

As of December 2023, 6,809 employees have received health and safety training. Maxis conducted a total of 320 briefing and training programmes on health and safety.

# HSE Second Surveillance Audit for ISO 45001:2018

In 2023, Maxis successfully completed its second Surveillance Audit for the ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Safety and Health Management System (OSHMS). The primary aim of the ISO 45001 standard is to ensure continuous improvement. The ISO 45001 scope covers Telecommunication Operations and Services for Maxis Broadband Sdn. Bhd.

This obligation also applies to our partners through the Partners HSE System Audit, enforcing a minimum audit criteria of OSHA 1994 and ISO 45001 to ensure their compliance to essential HSE standards. Key partners are expected to attend the Maxis Partners’ Forum twice.

# HSE Risk Management

# Employee Lost-Time Incident

As a crucial element of our OSHMS, Maxis engages with diverse stakeholders to identify hazards and evaluate risks using the Company’s Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Control (HIRARC) procedure. We also comply with the DOSH Notification of Accident, Dangerous Occurrence, Occupational Poisoning and Occupational Disease (NADOPOD) Regulations 2004, in conjunction with our HSE policy on Incident Investigation, Non-Conformity and Corrective Action procedure.

# Vehicle-Related Accident

In 2023, there were three employee vehicle-related accidents resulting in one major injury and two minor injuries.

# Contractor Lost-Time Incident

In 2023, there was an incident resulting in a contractor employee sustaining a minor injury.

# HSE Performance

| |2021|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Number of inspections/investigations conducted|705|773| |
|Number of Partners System audits conducted|12|25| |

In 2023, we have effectively executed both virtual and physical inspections, audits and Safety & Security Day for Maxis, a practice endorsed by DOSH and National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) since the onset of the pandemic. During these assessments, our HSE personnel ensured compliance with SOPs, evaluated housekeeping standards, assessed employees’ understanding of requirements and verified the Company’s adherence to provide a reasonably safe working environment for our employees. There were no employee or contractor fatalities recorded, in the year under review.

# Lost-Time Incident

| |2021|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Employee Lost-Time Incident (LTI) Rate|0.05|0.04|
|Employee Lost-Time Incident Frequency (LTIF) Rate|0.27|0.18|

An LTI refers to an injury sustained by a Maxis employee or contractor during the performance of a work-related task, rendering them incapable of performing their regular duties for a period following the incident.

LTIFR is calculated as the number of lost-time injuries that occurred during work-related tasks for Maxis, per 1 million hours worked.

The increased case numbers for lost-time incident in 2023, as compared to 2022, can be attributed to the heightened working exposure in both office and sites, given the larger number of employees returning to the office and a full resumption of all work activities in accordance with pre-pandemic period. This aligns with the government’s SOP, which has completely lifted all restrictions on working in the office/site. However, the lost workdays due to incidents in 2023 was 43% lower than the pre-pandemic period.

# COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

In upholding our commitment to community empowerment, we carried out initiatives emphasising on education, entrepreneurship, digital inclusion, digital literacy and disaster relief. Our mission is to use technology as a catalyst for community enhancement. We aspire to improve lives, foster inclusivity and establish sustainable digital ecosystems. By leveraging our unique position as a leading integrated telco in the country, we actively collaborate with the local communities and NGOs, focusing on three core areas:

- Enabling greater access to digital learning for students in rural communities.
- Empowering entrepreneurs and micro-SMEs with digital marketing skills.
- Reaching out to the vulnerable communities during festive seasons and providing humanitarian relief in times of difficulty such as natural disasters.

# Enabling greater access to digital learning for students, especially in rural communities

We help unlock students’ potential by facilitating broader digital learning access, ensuring equal opportunities for all students especially those in remote areas.

# eKelas® Programme

Launched in 2016, eKelas® focuses on improving student outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout Malaysia. The programme, accessible through the eKelas® portal and app, aims to overcome barriers to digital inclusion and offer learning support to help students develop the skills, knowledge and capabilities needed for their academic successes. eKelas® provides curriculum-aligned content and learning activities for Malaysian students aged from 10 to 17. To date, eKelas® has benefitted the lives of over 95,000 students registered on the portal across the country.

In 2023, we continued to partner with the Ministry of Education (MoE) by collaborating with its Sports, Co-curricular and Arts and Educational Technology and Resources Divisions, working together with the State and District Education Departments. We achieved a significant milestone by joining DELIMa, the Ministry of Education’s Digital Educational Learning Initiative Malaysia. Being part of DELIMa, Malaysian students from primary to secondary schools, teachers, and education leaders can sign into eKelas® with their DELIMa ID, and readily access eKelas®’ extensive breadth of free learning content including online workshops, exam clinics and webinars.

We welcome Maxis eKelas® as our new Rakan DELIMa partner and look forward to exploring greater collaboration with Maxis. This aligns well with the new national Digital Education Policy (DEP), where we involve strategic partners as a catalyst for digital education who share the same vision – to nurture digitally fluent students.

Tuan Zainal Abas, Director of the Educational Resources and Technology Division, MoE Malaysia.

We have also entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with UiTM. This collaboration aims to create engaging videos in the subjects of Science, Mathematics, and English. By partnering with UiTM's senior lecturers and students, the initiative aims to develop up to 100 videos featuring real-life role plays, experiments and animations.

# eKelas® Usahawan programme

In the post-pandemic world, digital skills are crucial for everyone to participate in the digital economy. Through our digital marketing programme, eKelas® Usahawan, we provide free workshops specifically tailored for micro entrepreneurs and small businesses specifically for those from the B40 segment to help improve their digital presence. Over 5,800 participants have been trained under the programme since its inception in 2021.

# The Impact

In 2023, eKelas® Usahawan held 34 physical workshops and webinars for a total of 3,142 entrepreneurs across Miri, Kuantan, Langkawi, Pasir Mas and other localities nationwide in partnership with 20 NGOs and agencies.

With modules covering digital marketing and strategy, digital photography and graphic design, copywriting, and campaign planning, our programme utilises a hybrid approach—conducting sessions through webinars and physical workshops nationwide. Overall, the programme received positive feedback from the participants with evaluation metrics reporting 94.17% satisfaction in training quality.

After attending the workshop, I learned how to narrow my focus when advertising for a niche audience. Putting my newly acquired knowledge into action, I tested it with one online ad, and it has proven to be effective! said Nur Syahirah binti Barhan, owner of an optical shop in Miri, Sarawak.

Reaching the right target market was one of the challenges for our business. Thanks to what we’ve learned from eKelas® Usahawan workshop, we now know more effective ways to identify our target audience and improve engagement with our customers, said Najwa Natash Che Nasir, owner of a jewellery shop in Kota Bharu, Kelantan.

When I joined the bandwagon of online business, I was following market trends without conducting proper research, which led to low traction for my business. After the workshop, I’ve learnt to better understand my customers and was also able to create quality content that tailored to their needs, said Dzunija Binti Jaldin, owner of a homemade product business in Kota Belud, Sabah.

# EMBEDDING RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES

At Maxis, we strive to create a work environment where each employee thrives, fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous learning and empowerment. We continue to provide equal opportunities and invest in attracting, retaining and developing top talent, driving innovation and success. We also consistently invest in the communities around us by leveraging on technology to create empowerment opportunities.

# Ethical Business Practice

At Maxis, our core operations are defined by an unwavering commitment to combat bribery and corruption, setting the bar for the highest ethical standards in the industry. Operating under a strict zero-tolerance policy, we ensure full compliance with local anti-corruption laws, regulations and policies. Our dedicated Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU) is in charge of driving this commitment. It is actively engaged in implementing, monitoring and continually enhancing anti-corruption controls within Maxis.

Maxis’ strategic approach to eradicating corruption is facilitated further through the forward-thinking Maxis Integrity & Compliance framework (MICF) and robust Anti-Money Laundering/Countering Financial Terrorism (AML/CFT) initiatives. The MICF, developed on the principles outlined in the Guidelines of Adequate Procedures pursuant to section 17A(5) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act 2009 that promotes integrity and compliance within our organisation while providing a robust shield against corporate liability.

Maxis’ management is dedicated to fostering a culture of integrity and ethical conduct throughout the organisation. Accountability for corporate governance lies with the Board and is regularly reviewed and monitored for full compliance. Our Anti-Bribery & Corruption Programme includes guidelines, ethical consultations, monitoring and regular training to deter non-compliance.

# Maxis Anti-Bribery Management (MABC) System

We have consistently and strategically enforced our MABC System organisation-wide to ensure ethical conduct of our directors, employees and representatives. This system strictly prohibits bribery, money laundering, and facilitation payments in all business transactions.

The IGU ensures the continuous implementation, compliance, enhancement, enforcement and effectiveness of the MABC System to fight against corruption, money laundering and financing terrorism risk activities. The overall effectiveness and implementation of the MABC has also been enhanced due to the ISO37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System certification that was obtained in November 2022. This year signifies our achievement of Zero Non-Conformity Reports during the ISO37001:2016 ABMS Surveillance Audit, which stands as a testament to our resolute pursuit of governance excellence.

# Number of confirmed incidents of non-compliance with MABC Policies

| |2021|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Number of Employees who were Disciplined or Dismissed due to Non-Compliance with MABC Policies*|18|2|0|

Note: * All non-compliances and violations of MABC System will lead to consequential management. We have enhanced our methodology for 2023 to ensure alignment with best practices.

# Corruption Risk Management (CRM)

In addressing bribery risks across our entire organisation, we employ CRM as our approach. This system involves evaluating associated risks, reviewing policies and procedures and implementing effective anti-bribery controls.

Within our CRM procedures, we identify structural weaknesses that may pose a risk of corruption. Additionally, we foster active employee engagement in identifying potential risk factors and proposing mitigation measures.

# Maxis Integrity Corporate Advocacy Programme (MICAP)

Maxis Integrity Corporate Advocacy Programme (MICAP) has been an integral component of our ongoing efforts to prevent bribery and corruption. In December 2023, we at Maxis celebrated the International Anti-Corruption Day as part of the MICAP initiative. We hosted an Advanced Technology Working Group session on December 6, 2023, in collaboration with the Business Integrity Alliance (BIA), founded and led by Dr. Mark Lovatt. The primary focus of the session was to explore technologies that can contribute to greater success in the governance, risk and compliance field.

We had speakers from notable organisations such as Access Blockchain Association Malaysia, Chainalysis, IBM, and Ernst & Young. Approximately 40 compliance and ethics officers from various corporations, including Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Shell, Sime Darby Berhad, PETRONAS, and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP), attended the session. During the event, we shared Maxis’ Integrity Journey, highlighting our commitment against bribery and corruption, along with our compliance with ISO 37001:2016 ABMS.
# OUR VALUE CREATION OUTCOME

# DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE VALUE

Following this, we organised Movie Time Week from 11-14 December 2023. The event featured screenings of international films at The Bazaar, Maxis Academy (L5), Menara Maxis. The selected films revolved around themes of anti-corruption, money laundering, and whistleblowing which includes “The Laundromat” (2019), “Official Secrets” (2019), “The Great Hack” (2019) and “The Insider” (1999).

# Upholding Procurement Governance

Our procurement policies and procedures establish the benchmark for all procurement activities throughout Maxis. Adhering to the policies enable us to achieve operational excellence in the procurement of products and services and delivering the best overall value for Maxis. Our suppliers are expected to deliver and exceed our expectations when it comes to quality and cost in turn we ensure that we build a robust relationship and engage with our suppliers for them to meet our standards.

Our MCOBP incorporates guidelines to facilitate third-party compliance with our business conduct across all transactions with external parties. All third parties that we engage must read, comprehend, and commit to complying with the MCOBP upon official collaboration. Additionally, Maxis' IGU conducts an annual Vendor Integrity Programme to enhance awareness of our zero-tolerance policy for bribery and corruption among external entities.

Our Vendor Management team also assesses our key suppliers to ensure that they maintain their performance on top of staying progressive in delivering.

# Responsible Procurement Practices

Responsible procurement is crucial for Maxis as it widely addresses areas such as professional integrity, confidentiality obligations, conflict of interest and segregation of duties, amongst others. We continue to be guided by our robust procurement policies and procedures which outline the entire process of sourcing, selecting and evaluating the performances of suppliers. Our suppliers are evaluated and chosen based on their adherence to technical and commercial criteria accordingly to the Maxis standards. This method not only fosters healthy competition among suppliers, but also presents growth prospects for emerging businesses. Our holistic approach also ensures that our suppliers undergo proper assessment and due diligence before being officially appointed, enabling us to effectively mitigate the risk of potential corrupt practices. Additionally, our potential suppliers are also required to undergo our vendor onboarding process, submit their business and financial documentation for evaluation and acknowledge our Maxis Code of Business Practice for Third Parties.

We strive to achieve timely delivery and ample supplies through continuous communication with our suppliers. To further support timely delivery, we proactively plan for our business needs by identifying and securing alternative sources when required. In our Source to Contract framework, we have enhanced processes and technology tools which enables online interactions with our suppliers throughout the onboarding, tendering, and contracting stages. This process ensures transparency and facilitates proper audit trails in our procurement operations.

# OUTLOOK

We are moving towards embedding automation and technology to drive efficiency in our procurement process. Simultaneously, we will continue to strengthen transparency and implement robust governance and controls to mitigate our risk exposure. With our digital platforms and tools, we can establish distinct roles and responsibilities for stakeholders involved based on frameworks formed across category management, sourcing, contract management, and supplier relationship management. Our objective is to cultivate successful partnerships with suppliers, ensuring the delivery of quality products and services for Maxis while simultaneously, monitoring our transactional suppliers to optimise spend.
# OUR VALUE CREATION OUTCOME

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

We have planned our journey in achieving a sustainable supply chain according to:

# Short-term plans: 1-2 years

- Continuous process simplification and improvement review to support our go-to-market through technology enablement.
- Enhance standardised contract management framework across the board with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and expectations.
- Uphold zero tolerance to unethical business conducts while striking a balance between adequate controls and business requirements.

# Medium-term plans: 2-5 years

- Further explore automation and AI capability enablement for improved operational efficiency while staying focused on strategic initiatives.
- Incorporate sustainability elements into our supply chain in line with Maxis’ sustainability ambition and commitment.

# Cybersecurity

Enhancing cyber resilience continues to be a key priority for Maxis as we face evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. We remain focused on implementing core capabilities to anticipate, withstand, rapidly recover and adapt to cyberattacks aiming to compromise our systems and customer data. We continue to focus on our three strategic cybersecurity pillars: Protecting the Brand and Ensuring Compliance, Embedding Security in Our DNA, and Strengthening Cyber Resilience while actively supporting our digital ambitions.

We actively engage with regulators such as MCMC and the National Cybersecurity Agency (NACSA) to collaborate and contribute towards combating cybersecurity issues, including through participation in industry-wide initiatives to uplift national cyber resilience.

By taking a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity and fostering strategic partnerships, we aim to always be ahead of threats and maintain security for our networks, applications, and customers' data.

# Long-term plans: 5 years and beyond

Establish a mature supplier relationship management with suppliers, benefitting from strategic collaboration in addressing performance issues, joint development programmes and other improvement opportunities.

# Data Privacy & Protection

Maxis prioritises the importance of data privacy and protection of personal data. To this end, we empower individuals to control the personal data that we process, and we have a dedicated Data Privacy Office (DPO) that oversees our comprehensive Data Privacy and Protection Programme.

Our robust Data Privacy and Protection Programme ensures compliance with Malaysia’s Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA), Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for Communications Sector 2017 and related regulations.

We have comprehensive policies and procedures for handling personal data across all our operations, that are regularly updated to reflect any legal changes. Furthermore, Maxis has a dedicated team that investigates alleged data privacy incidents and breaches. The DPO closely monitors new data privacy and protection laws and actively participates in industry and cross-industries discussions on data privacy and protection regulations to ensure that we are always kept abreast of the most recent updates. The DPO also regularly monitors and assesses risks to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.

98% of Maxis employees that received data privacy and protection training
ZERO substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data in 2023

Maxis has achieved significant milestones, demonstrating our commitment to global standards. We have renewed our ISO 27001 certification for our Information Security Management System (ISMS) across our Cloud Infrastructure, Voice and Data Networks, Enterprise Managed Services and Key Data Centres without any non-compliances. We have gradually increased our scope to cover cloud infrastructure and key applications. Audited by SIRIM, the ISMS scope highlights robust policies and controls safeguarding infrastructure and information. Maxis also maintains PCI DSS compliance providing stringent protections for our customer payment systems and data.

In addition to these certifications, we have launched proactive initiatives to engage the security community and customers. Our Vulnerability Disclosure Programme (VDP) and Bug Bounty offerings recognise and reward ethical hackers for identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities responsibly. This allows us to tap into a wider pool of expertise to strengthen our defenses.

By conforming to internationally recognised best practices and proactively partnering with the community, customers can remain confident in the security and compliance of Maxis' offerings.

# Protecting Our Brand and Ensuring Compliance

Protecting our brand and ensuring compliance remain key priorities. This year, we increased our vulnerability management coverage across the cloud, containers and applications in our continuous integration and continuous deployment or CI/CD pipelines and application.
# OUR VALUE CREATION OUTCOME

# DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE VALUE

We achieved a significant milestone in vulnerability remediation this year. Through increased automation, we strengthened defences against 45% more vulnerabilities compared to last year. We continued investments and process improvements in security for our 4G/5G networks, cloud and APIs with focused automation efforts aligned with business growth in these areas.

Protecting customers remains at the heart of our cybersecurity strategy as cyber risks intensify. We doubled the takedown of fake applications and malicious URLs over the last year, proactively combating cyber fraud and threats targeting our customers. To reinforce data protection, we enhanced controls across several fronts. We expanded data encryption coverage and implemented additional data loss prevention measures through increased monitoring, automated alerts and analytics. Access policies were tightened via strengthened identity and access management controls. Data classification tiers were also simplified to facilitate accurate sensitivity labelling for information assets. Leveraging leading database firewalls, we improved detection capabilities to monitor potential PII data leaks from Maxis’ systems. Maxis aligned with industry frameworks. We worked with business teams to identify key business priorities and launched a pilot Security Operating Centre operated fully in the cloud with our partners. We improved the coverage of prevention and detection tools with enhanced incident response processes across cloud, identity, network and endpoints, conditional access, privileged access management and network threat detection to harden critical access points. Through proactive threat hunting, backed by industry intelligence sharing, we were able to avoid potential attacks before realisation. We also reduced the mean time to closure for security incidents by 53% through these initiatives.

Additionally, we prioritised security by design requirements from project inception via reviews for new initiatives. Cloud environments now feature defined guardrails to ensure our security posture and compliance are standardised. Recognising intensifying API threats, we included assessments to validate API security controls. Our emphasis on preventative measures aligns with the proactive threat hunting and response improvements already realised.

# Embedding Security in Our DNA

Embedding security in our DNA involves establishing it as a key part of our culture and workforce. This year, we continued our comprehensive awareness programmes for all staff, focused on key topics such as data protection and key cybersecurity controls. We introduced our Security-Flix channel with multiple episodes showcasing cybersecurity and our Gamification Challenge, where the interactive experience was well received and doubled participation across Maxis. Additionally, we actively conducted phishing simulation campaigns to provide hands-on identification training by replicating actual threats users may encounter via email or messaging. Targeted training sessions were also provided through initiatives like Hackathons to bolster specific skills, with an emphasis on application security for developers. Strategic partnerships with leading cloud providers including AWS, GCP and Azure enabled specialised education for our cybersecurity and infrastructure teams to improve cloud security expertise. Notably, the active participation and engagement of senior management and Board members in our tabletop exercises offered an opportunity to strengthen cybersecurity preparedness and response planning across the leadership team. Through diverse, immersive training, coupled with participative simulations, we drive security ownership at all levels as a collective responsibility.

# OUTLOOK

Our long-term vision focuses on evolving into a cyber-resilient digital telecommunications company. We expect threats against mobile networks, systems and attempts to compromise data to grow more advanced and persistent. At the same time, our interconnected supply chains create new risks. We pre-empt this through our investment into resources, capabilities, AI/ML (machine learning)-led capabilities, targeted automation and strong partnerships. We will continue to expand our monitoring of systems and infrastructure, keeping pace with innovation.

By maintaining conformance to best practice security frameworks and controls, we continue to strengthen protection across assets and attack surfaces. We are committed to collaborating with the government, regulators and law enforcement to uplift national cyber readiness by protecting Malaysia’s digital economy. We actively contribute to technical standards and provide feedback on guidelines and policies to progress industry best practices in multiple cybersecurity domains.

# Strengthening Cyber Resilience and Supporting Digitalisation

To strengthen cyber resilience while enabling innovation, we pursued several key initiatives this year. We focused on a set of standardised cybersecurity controls across our operations, technology, systems, culture and partnerships, identifying and addressing risks before they occur. We believe realising Malaysia’s digital economy requires collaborative, preventative cybersecurity across sectors and Maxis will continue leading this charge.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE APPROACH

The Board sets the tone at the top for Maxis’ corporate governance practices and its application to the Maxis Group. The Board’s commitment to corporate governance practices and applicable policies and procedures within Maxis is fundamental to sustain the Group as a leading integrated telco.

This Corporate Governance Overview Statement (CGOS) should be read together with the:

- (i) Corporate Governance (CG) Report, that details application of each Practice set out in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG). The CG Report is accessible online at https://maxis.listedcompany.com/general_meetings.html together with an announcement of the same on the website of Bursa Securities.
- (ii) Other statements in this Integrated Annual Report (IAR) e.g. Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC), Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) Report, as well as Statement of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC).

The CGOS and the CG Report are prepared in compliance with Paragraph 15.25 of the MMLR. The CGOS and CG Report were approved by the Board on 1 April 2024.

# SUMMARY OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES FOR 2023

Maxis has evaluated its practices against the three (3) key principles as set out in the MCCG, namely Principle A: Board Leadership and Effectiveness, Principle B: Effective Audit and Risk Management and Principle C: Integrity in Corporate Reporting and Meaningful Relationship with Stakeholders. Maxis has applied all the Practices espoused by the MCCG for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, save for the following departures:

- Practice 4.2 (Sustainability strategies, priorities, targets, and performance against these targets are communicated to internal and external stakeholders);

The Board has provided disclosures on the alternative measures which would largely attain similar outcomes to that of the Intended Outcomes envisaged by the MCCG. The explanations on the departures and supplements with alternative practices are contained in the CG Report.

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# BOARD COMPOSITION

The Board comprises market and industry leaders, cutting across multiple fields, who accordingly serve as Independent Non-Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. In 2023, the Board comprised of ten (10) Directors, of whom 50% (5 out of 10) are Independent Non-Executive Directors.

Directors’ profiles are set out on pages 64 to 68 of this IAR while the Board Composition overview can be found on pages 62 and 63.

The Board considers that its composition and size are adequate for carrying out its functions and responsibilities effectively. With its diverse qualifications, expertise, and skills, as well as the governance structure of the Board Committees and Board, the Board has been able to provide clear and effective leadership to the Group, as well as informed and independent judgment of the Group’s strategy and performance, to ensure the highest standards of conduct and integrity are always at the core of the Group’s undertakings. None of the Non-Executive Directors are involved in the Group’s day-to-day management.

The Senior Independent Director, namely Alvin Michael Hew Thai Kheam, acts as a sounding board for the Chairman and as an intermediary for Independent Directors. Additionally, he is tasked with the instrumental role of serving as a contact point for shareholders and stakeholders to raise any matters pertaining to Maxis.

The presence of Independent Non-Executive Directors on the Board and its Board Committees are essential, as they provide unbiased as well as impartial opinions and judgment to Board deliberations. This ensures the interests of not just the Group, but also its various stakeholders are taken into account and well-represented.

Details of the independence assessment are available on pages 84 to 85 of the Statement of the NRC.

# COMPANY SECRETARY

The Board is supported by the Company Secretary who is qualified to act as company secretary under the CA 2016. The Company Secretary acts as advisor to the Board, particularly on Maxis Group’s Constitutions, internal policies and compliance and on applicable governance best practices, corporate administration, and Board processes to facilitate overall compliance with the MMLR, CA 2016 and applicable laws, rules and regulations.

The Board members have full access to the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary ensures that the Directors are provided with sufficient information and time to prepare for Board and/or Committee meetings. To this, the meeting materials are made accessible to the Directors on their devices within reasonable periods prior to the meetings. The Company Secretary also ensures the minutes of meetings are prepared in a timely manner and the records are well documented while she concurrently communicates with Management on the action items and facilitates follow-up requests, decisions or recommendations from the Board.

The Company Secretary also facilitates the induction of new Directors and the continuous training needs of Directors including those identified pursuant to the Board Effectiveness Evaluation each year.

# BOARD APPOINTMENTS

The NRC makes independent recommendations for selection and appointments to the Board, based on criteria which they develop, maintain and review based on applicable laws and regulations.

The NRC will review the gap analysis based on the existing Board composition such as optimum size, and diversity in terms of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and independence, having regard to the strategic direction of the Company. This then forms the proposed selection criteria.

In the best effort to provide high quality support and advice to the Board, the Company Secretary constantly keeps herself abreast of the progressing and everchanging regulatory landscape and corporate governance development through continuous trainings.

Please refer to the profile of the Company Secretary on page 225.

Amongst others, the Directors of the Company, attended various trainings on industry and economic outlook, cyber security, sustainability and ESG, talent management and leadership, governance matters and operational matters.

The external auditors regularly share their publications on governance, financial standards and other topics. Management and/or external experts consistently provide updates to the Board on industry related operational, technology, financial, regulatory and governance developments. Prior to each Board Meeting, the Directors receive detailed papers that comprise information and background materials relevant to matters on the Agenda.

This policy addresses the application of Paragraph 2.20A of the MMLR that requires every listed corporation to ensure that each of its directors, chief executive or chief financial officer has the character, experience, integrity, competence and time to effectively discharge his/her role as a director, chief executive or chief financial officer.

The Fit and Proper Policy established the duties and responsibilities of the NRC in overseeing the application of the said Policy as well as the conduct of fit and proper assessments relating to Directors, CEO and CFO.

# BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY

The Board recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board and sees increasing diversity at the Board level as an essential element in maintaining a competitive advantage. A truly diverse Board encompasses various areas including, but not limited to diversity of age, skills, experience, cultural background, gender, ethnicity and nationality of its Board members to ensure effective governance and robust decision-making by the Board. The NRC and Board regularly review the composition of the Board to ensure the proper discharge of its functions and obligations.

Underpinning Maxis Board Diversity Policy is Maxis’ commitment in ensuring that all Directors are appointed on merit and in line with the standards as set out in Paragraph 2.20A of the MMLR. The background of each Director can be found on pages 64 to 68 of this Integrated Annual Report, which demonstrates the Board’s Diversity Policy. The Board regularly reviews its composition to improve its diversity including gender diversity.

The search to appoint additional women on the Board is a continuous effort. The review and selections are aligned with Maxis’ requirements for diversity, and for candidates with the experience and calibre who can contribute to the Group’s growth strategy as a leading integrated telco.

The Board endeavors to meet its diversity requirements and targets to accomplish at least 30% women directors on the Board. The NRC and Board are always on the lookout to expand the pool of potential women candidates for Board candidacy. In 2023, the NRC and the Board considered the appointment of additional Independent Directors from a pool of potential candidates that were obtained from various sources including independent search firms. In line with this, the Board endeavors to take incremental steps to achieving the diversity requirements of the MCCG.

This NRC Statement should be read together with the Corporate Governance Overview Statement and CG Report 2023.

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

• In their quarterly meetings, the Committee received updates from Internal Assurance on the 2023 Annual Audit Plan. These updates included progress on engagements, main findings, conclusions from audits, recommendations, investigation results, and the status of Management's corrective actions to resolve issues promptly.

• The Committee was updated on the progress of audit automation and the results from automated reports. They reviewed how digitalisation improved oversight of risks and controls, particularly by addressing exceptions noted in these reports more promptly. Throughout the year, each business unit was responsible for resolving issues identified by the automated reports and enhancing their self-assessment of risk and control effectiveness, ensuring the proper application of internal controls. Additionally, the Committee advised Internal Assurance to focus automation on key risk areas, reducing Management’s workload and avoiding duplication with other line of defence functions.

• In its last quarterly meeting of the year, the Committee discussed the 2024 Annual Audit Plan, focusing on priority areas, evolving risks in the organisation and industry, and the Company’s growth strategy. The plan covered crucial governance areas, which include finance, business operations, contract management, forensic reviews, technology, and regulatory compliance, as well as top and emerging risks, strategic initiatives, and ongoing audit automation development. The Committee also examined the scope and coverage of the planned activities to ensure that major risk areas and key business processes, identified by the Enterprise Risk Management department and internal audit, were properly addressed.

• The Committee emphasised that fraud and bribery risk areas; financial discipline; and business policy compliance should be given heightened focus, with the aim to strengthen the control environment and compliance stature of the Company. These risks are addressed through forensic type of review, which focuses on in-depth evaluation of the rationale, decision-making processes, adequacy of controls and fraud prevention, as well as avoidable losses. The Committee emphasised that Internal Assurance is to increase forensic expertise within the function. The Committee advised Internal Assurance to consider the impact to the business and value for money when conducting its work.

• During the same meeting, the internal audit function presented for the Committee’s approval the divisional KPIs for 2024 covering four strategic focus areas: Operations, Customers, Innovation and Learning & Development. The KPIs were updated to be in line with the progress of the three-year roadmap with emphasis on measures that promotes strengthening of the business internal control environment and compliance practices; expanding its continuous assurance capability using automation technologies; and efficiency outcomes from Agile processes.

• The Committee continuously reviewed the adequacy and competency of the resources in Internal Assurance Division.

The programme aims to enhance business acumen; leadership skills; and risk and compliance mindset of the identified talents through audit assignments participation, while enhancing employees’ career experience.

• At its concluding meeting, the Committee was apprised of the outcomes of the mandatory External Quality Assessment Review, undertaken by an independent third party. The results of this comprehensive review indicated that Maxis Internal Assurance is in full compliance with the International Standards for the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing set forth by the IIA. Additionally, a comparative benchmarking against global internal auditing functions was conducted, revealing that majority of the evaluated areas within its processes are operating at ‘Optimised’ and ‘Managed’ levels of capability maturity. Moreover, the assessment highlighted Maxis Internal Assurance's position in increasing digital capabilities.

# EMBEDDING TRUST

# AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE REPORT

The Committee also held a total of 3 separate private sessions with the internal and external auditors without the presence of Management. Both the internal and external auditors have unfettered access to members of the Committee, including the Chairman, any time during the year.

Deliberations during the Committee meetings were minuted. The Chairman of the Committee reported the proceedings of the Committee to the Board after every Committee meeting. Minutes of the meetings were circulated to all members of the Board and significant issues were brought up and discussed at Board meetings.

Given the complexity of the business and the responsibility of the Committee, the Committee is aware that it cannot discharge its role by the process of only formal meetings. In this respect, the Committee does seek information and have discussions with Management, extra Committee meetings, to understand business issues as and when they arise.

# TRAINING

Trainings attended by the Committee members during the financial year is reported under the Corporate Governance Overview on page 78.

# INTERNAL ASSURANCE DIVISION

The full headcount for Internal Assurance Division is 24 and is further supported by two rotational employees from the Assurance Leadership Development Talent Programme, each assigned for a one-year term.

The division is headed by Shafik Azlee Mashar, who has many years of experience in managing internal audit functions within telecommunications, FMCG and banking organisations. Shafik holds a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems Engineering from Imperial College of Science Technology & Medicine, London and is a Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Certified PRINCE2 Project Management Professional, Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) for Agile and Certified Lead Auditor for ISO37001:2016 Anti-Bribery.

The Head of the Internal Assurance Division reports directly to the Chairman of the Committee, and is responsible for enhancing the quality assurance and improvement programme of the internal audit function. Its effectiveness is monitored through continuous internal and external quality assessments and the results are communicated to the Committee.

The total costs incurred for the internal audit function for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 amounted to RM7.7 million (2022: RM7.5 million).

The internal audit function fully abides by the provisions of its charter. The Internal Assurance Charter is reviewed and approved by the Committee annually. The internal audit function’s activities conform to the International Standards for the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing set forth by the IIA.

The Group has an in-house independent internal audit function (internally referred to as the Internal Assurance Division) that reports directly to the Committee. Its primary responsibility is to provide independent and objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management, internal control and governance processes established by Management and/or the Board within the Group. The Audit and Risk Committee has regular dialogues and sessions with the Head of Internal Assurance and team throughout the year.
# EMBEDDING TRUST

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# BOARD RESPONSIBILITY

The Board affirms its overall responsibility for the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management. The Group has an established risk management and internal control framework.

Management has primary responsibility for identifying, assessing, addressing, monitoring and reporting key business risks. Risk management and internal control systems are designed to identify, assess and manage risks that may impede the achievement of the Group’s business objectives and strategies rather than to eliminate these risks entirely. They can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against fraud, material misstatement or loss, and this is achieved through a combination of preventive, detective and corrective measures.

The risk management and internal control framework are embedded into the culture, processes and structures of the Group which are subject to regular review by the Board. These reviews are an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks that may affect the Group’s achievement of its business objectives and strategies.

The Group’s risk management and internal control framework, in all material aspects, are consistent with the guidance provided to Directors as set out in the “Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers”.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk management is an integral part of the Group’s business strategy formulation and implementation. Oversight over this critical area is carried out by the Audit and Risk Committee. The Audit and Risk Committee, supported by the internal audit function, provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of the Maxis Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and reports to the Board periodically.

The Maxis ERM framework is broadly based on the ERM framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Maxis’ ERM framework involves identifying, analysing, measuring, responding, monitoring and reporting on risks that may affect the achievement of its business objectives. Risk indicators and key performance indicators are applied to ensure that risks are managed within the established risk appetite. This framework helps the Group to respond adequately to uncertainties surrounding the Group’s internal and external environment. The ERM function reports to the Board on a quarterly basis through the ARC. For major risks to which the Group is exposed, refer to the Business Model section on pages 25 to 28.

There is an ERM function that oversees implementation of the ERM Framework. A process has been established where ERM discussions are held on a regular basis between units within divisions/departments/sections to identify potential risks. In addition, the ERM team participates in strategic and operational discussions regularly. The ERM function also focuses on risk areas related to project management risks and fraud management risks (prevention and detection).

Changes to risk information and newly identified risks are then reported, reviewed and discussed with the Maxis Management Team (MMT) and with the Audit and Risk Committee on a quarterly basis.

All identified risks are displayed on a five-by-five risk matrix based on their risk ranking to assist Management to prioritise their efforts and appropriately manage the different levels of risk. The Board implemented a process where the risk management function assists the Transformation Committee in its evaluation of projects risks.

Risk Management e-module and risk information dashboard are continuously being utilised by the ERM team in promoting risk awareness and facilitating risk management activities. During the year, a Bribery and Corruption Risk Framework & Cybersecurity Risk Assessment via ServiceNow was implemented.

# CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND STRUCTURE

Inculcating and ensuring a risk awareness and management culture is an ongoing process. The Board and Management have established processes and introduced tools for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group. These include testing of the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal control procedures and updating the system of internal controls when there are changes to the business environment or regulatory guidelines. These processes have been in place for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and up to the date of approval of this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control for inclusion in the Integrated Annual Report.

# The key elements of the Group’s control environment include:

1. Organisation Structure
The business of the Group is overseen by the Board. The Board is supported by a number of established committees, namely Audit and Risk, Nomination and Remuneration, Transformation, Government and Regulatory Affairs, Share Issuance and ad-hoc operational and governance committees that are formed from time to time. Each Committee has clearly defined terms of reference and responsibilities reports to the Board on its activities to keep the Board updated and to assist in decision-making where relevant.

Please refer to the Corporate Governance Overview for further details.
# EMBEDDING TRUST

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

The Board and Board Committees have full access to Management and information in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities.

Responsibility for implementing the Group’s strategies, operations, and day-to-day businesses, including implementing the system of risk management and internal control, is delegated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The organisation structure sets out segregation of roles and responsibilities, lines of accountability and limits of authority.

# 2. Code of Conduct and Code of Business

The Group’s Code of Conduct (CoC) and Code of Business Practice (CoBP) stipulate how Directors and employees as well as external parties such as third-party employees, contractors, consultants and/or personnel positioned in Group’s premises and acting on Group’s behalf, including all parties or entities doing business with the Group, should conduct themselves lawfully and ethically in all business matters.

All Directors, employees and third-party employees are required to complete the Annual Mandatory CoC and CoBP Assessment and Acknowledgement. All Assessments and Acknowledgements are rolled out annually in January for existing employees including third party contractors (TPCs). All assigned assessments are to be completed by 28 calendar days of the assigned date.

The CoBP encompasses compliance and governance of its embedded policies surrounding business practices such as the Maxis Anti-Bribery and Corruption (MABC), data privacy and protection, insider trading etc. It also entails the Group’s corporate responsibility in order to contribute to the realisation of human rights and labour standards in accordance with the Malaysian laws and labour practices, by committing to workplace diversity and respecting differences.

Annual mandatory training and assessments are carried out together with regular company-wide campaigns, reminders and communications by the respective Policy Owners. Compliance Champions for the respective Divisions assist to expand the compliance footprint in relations to two integral policies in the Group, i.e. MABC and Personal Data Privacy & Protection.

In ensuring proper governance are in place for managing risk and controls, the Group practices three lines of defence (3-LoD) approach highlighted as per below:

|1st Line Defence|2nd Line Defence|3rd Line Defence|
|---|---|---|
|Management Operation Controls|Enterprise Risk Management|Internal Assurance|
|Operation Control Measures|Financial Control|Cyber Security|
|Revenue Assurance|Compliance|Data Privacy Office|
|Business Continuity Management| | |

• First line of defence (Functions that own & manage risks and its relevant controls): The line management responsible for identifying & managing risks directly (design/ operation of controls).

• Second line of defence (Functions that exercise oversight over risk and its controls): Risk and assurance functions responsible for on-going monitoring of design and operation of controls in the first line of defence and providing advice and facilitating risk management and control design activities.

• Third line of defence (Functions that provide independent assurance): ARC is assisted by Internal Audit responsible for independent assurance over managing of risks and its controls.
# 3. Audit and Risk Committee (ARC)

The ARC consists of five non-executive members of the Board, majority of whom are Independent Directors. The ARC reviews the Group’s financial reporting process, the system of internal controls, the implementation and management of ERM framework and the work of both internal and external auditors. The ARC also reviews the process for monitoring ethics, whistleblowing and compliance with laws and regulations, as well as other matters which may be specifically delegated to the ARC by the Board from time to time. The ARC, as a minimum, meets quarterly.

The Whistleblowing policy is managed by the Internal Assurance team, and all reported incidences are communicated to the ARC Chairman upon receipt. All allegations are investigated and reported to the ARC.

The ARC also reviews the sufficiency of the MABC system and ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS). The Compliance Officer as Head of Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU) updates the ARC on the implementation of the Maxis Integrity Compliance Framework (MICF) and the overall effectiveness of the MABC system. The Compliance Officer also advises the Board on issues of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules, directives and guidelines. The ARC also reviews the independence and determines the authority and area of responsibility of the IGU.

ARC members are regularly briefed on key matters affecting the financial statements of the Group.

The external auditors report to the ARC on their independence, the nature, approach, scope and fees charged. The ARC also reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit function, which include inter alia, the nature, scope and results of their work.

During 2023, the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud management, including whistleblowing are being given as an added review focus by the ARC.

The ARC has full and unimpeded access to the internal and external auditors and all employees of the Group. The Chairman of the ARC provides the Board with reports and results held by the ARC. Further details of the activities undertaken by the ARC are set out in the ARC Report on pages 87 to 91.

# 4. Internal Assurance

The internal audit function (internally known as the Internal Assurance Division) reviews key processes, evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control, risk management and governance processes established by Management and/or the Board. It is also responsible to investigate all questionable transactions or MABC non-compliance when information is received and detected internally or externally.

The Internal Assurance division’s practices are governed by the Internal Assurance Charter, which is subject to revision on an annual basis. The annual audit plan, established on a risk-based approach, is reviewed and approved by the ARC annually and an update is given to the ARC every quarter. The internal audit function also practices technology-driven automated checks over a number of selected internal control areas.

# EMBEDDING TRUST

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The rapid pace of technology change continues to expand our threat landscape, especially in areas of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, IoT and beyond. These innovations introduce new vectors for cyberattacks that can leave systems and data vulnerable.

We remain vigilant against advanced, evolving methods that threat actors could potentially use to gain unauthorised access within our environments. Some common critical threats we continually monitor for and mitigate include data breaches, malware infections, denial-of-service attacks, and abuse of privileged credentials.

We have focused on evaluating and strengthening security and data protection controls in parallel with adopting new technologies to address emerging risks.

# 9.1 Cybersecurity and Data Protection

The CSM's functions in the Group oversees cybersecurity and data protection. The function monitors and mitigates both internal and external cybersecurity threats, operates cybersecurity and data protection tools, maintain compliance with regulatory and industry security standards, develop policies and technical specifications, provide awareness and capacity building. The team works closely with other divisions and provides regular reports to management and the ARC.

During the financial year, the organisation’s cybersecurity team conducted a review of data protection controls and policies for employee mobile devices and corporate devices. Working closely with key business units, the security team evaluated existing data leak prevention rules to align with evolving data environments and risk priorities. To bolster data protection capabilities, the security team implemented expanded Information Rights Management functionalities and Data Leakage Prevention tools with new detections tailored to detect data loss risks across on-premises and cloud-based data. Finally, taking a user-centric approach to security, the team consolidated and simplified data labeling practices to include only the most essential categories. With easier to adopt labeling, employees can consistently classify and protect sensitive information throughout the organisation. The overall data protection programme enhancements this year focused on strengthening technical controls, enhancing user experiences, and improving data security on the human side.

The organisation’s cybersecurity team focused on proactive cyber defense to get ahead of emerging threats. Threat hunting exercises were continually done to probe for hidden risks and vulnerabilities. Public facing systems undergo frequent vulnerability scanning and annual penetration testing to harden defenses. Breach and attack simulation tools are executed to mimic the latest advanced persistent threat techniques to test tooling. Regular reviews of identity and access controls and entitlements ensure proper permissions and data access. Cyber threat intelligence efforts also monitor the dark web and industry sources for early warnings on potential threats to take preventative actions before the organisation is targeted.

To further improve preventative cybersecurity controls, secure development practices for Application Programming Interface (APIs) were developed. Endpoint detection and response capabilities were expanded to analyse all hosts for indicators of compromise. Cloud infrastructure and code repositories now have security testing and policy compliance checks baked into the continuous delivery pipeline. Other layered controls around access management also create barriers to prevent access abuse. Tuning and maintenance of core security tools takes place regularly to ensure adequate security protection and coverage. Additionally, controls dashboards were implemented to increase visibility into risk and compliance postures across business units.

Significant effort went toward improving detective controls and response capabilities including adding new use cases to the 24/7 security operations center. Alert triage procedures were refined to minimise false positives and ensure higher fidelity detection of potential incidents for investigation. Updated response playbooks now integrate automation to accelerate containment upon threats identified by expanded monitoring. Finally, collaborative purple team exercises bring defenders and ethical hackers together to surface security gaps through simulated real-world attacks on the digital environment.

# 9.2 Data Privacy

The Group is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its subscribers’, employees’, directors,’ third parties’ and other stakeholders’ personal data. We recognise that personal data is valuable and that individuals have a right to control how their personal data is collected, used, and shared. To this end, we have entrusted the Data Privacy Office (DPO) to run the Data Privacy and Protection Programme.
# EMBEDDING TRUST

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# Our Data Privacy Practices

We have implemented a comprehensive Data Privacy and Protection Programme to ensure that we comply with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 and Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for the Communications Sector 2017. Our Data Privacy and Protection Programme includes the following:

- Data Privacy and Protection Policy, Data Subjects Request Procedure and Data Privacy Incident and Management Procedure: We have developed and implemented comprehensive Data Privacy and Protection standard operating policy and procedures (SOPP) that cover all aspects of the Group’s operations which process personal data. These SOPP will be updated when data privacy laws and/or organisational changes in the Group affect the relevant entity or division processing personal data.
- Personal Data Privacy compliance training: As part of the Group’s Digitisation initiative, we have rolled out Personal Data Privacy compliance training via Maxis Academy in September 2022 to ensure that all the Group’s staffs are aware of their obligations when processing personal data in their daily operations. We also provide custom Personal Data Privacy training to the Group’s exclusive distributors, dealers, Hotlink Foot Soldiers (HFS) and Hotlink Independent Agents (HIAs).
- Data Privacy Incident and Breach Investigation Response Team: The DPO will be part of the Response Team when investigating and assessing any complaints of any data privacy incidents. We also have a privacy hotline email for any staff to lodge a complaint or report any data privacy incident and breach for the DPO to investigate.
- New Data Privacy Laws Monitoring and Gap Analysis: The DPO monitors new data privacy laws and regulations in Malaysia and conducts gap analysis to identify any areas of non-compliance. As the Telco Forum representative, the Group was invited to participate in the cross-industries engagement session conducted by the Ministry of Communications and Digital together with the Personal Data Protection Commission on the Commission’s proposed amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act 2010. As part of our corporate responsibility, we then updated the Telco Forum on the proposed amendments so that they could be prepared for the upcoming amendments too.
- Compliance Monitoring: DPO conducts regular compliance monitoring to ensure that the Group is complying with all applicable data privacy laws and our internal SOPP. This year, we successfully conducted 3 Privacy Impact Maturity Assessments across all the Group operating entities to identify and assess the Group’s current privacy maturity level, and to develop a plan to improve its privacy practices considering the upcoming amendments to the Personal Data Protection Act 2010.
- Data Privacy risk assessment: We regularly conduct data privacy risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential risks to personal data.

The Group will continue to invest in our data privacy programme to ensure that we are compliant with all applicable data privacy laws and regulations.

3. which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company, misleading or inappropriate.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the summary of material accounting policies in Note 3 to the financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported financial year. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgment in the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgments are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.
# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# (a) Amendments to published standards and interpretations that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company

The Group and the Company have applied the following amendments to published standards for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2023:

- Amendments to MFRS 101 “Classification of liabilities as Current or Non-current”
- Amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 on “Disclosure of Accounting Policies”
- Amendments to MFRS 108 “Definition of Accounting Estimates”
- Amendments to MFRS 112 “Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction”

The adoption of the above amendments to published standards did not have any significant effect on the consolidated and separate financial statements of the Group and of the Company respectively upon their initial application.

# (b) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective

The amendments below to published standards are effective for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2024. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated and separate financial statements of the Group and the Company respectively.

- Amendments to MFRS 16 “Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback”
- Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7 “Supplier Finance Arrangements”
- Amendments to MFRS 101 “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants”

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the financial statements.

# (a) Basis of consolidation

# (i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Basis of consolidation (continued)

# (i) Subsidiaries (continued)

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations when the acquired sets of activities and assets meet the definition of business. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date and any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. See accounting policy Note 3(c)(iii) on goodwill.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position respectively.

All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the non-controlling interests, even if the attribution of losses to the non-controlling interests results in a debit balance in the shareholders’ equity. Profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests for prior years is not restated.
# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Basis of consolidation (continued)

# (ii) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the Group.

# (b) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure (including borrowing and staff costs) that is directly attributable to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of certain property, plant and equipment items include the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the sites on which these items are located. These costs are due to obligations incurred either when the items were installed or as a consequence of having used these items during a particular period.

Certain telecommunications assets are stated at the amount of cash or cash equivalent that would have to be paid if the same or an equivalent asset was acquired. Included in telecommunications equipment are purchased software costs which are integral to such equipment.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred.

Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.

# (b) Property, plant and equipment (continued)

All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method to write-off the cost of each category of assets to its residual value over its estimated useful life, summarised as follows:

|Buildings|44 - 50 years|
|---|---|
|Telecommunications equipment|2 - 25 years|
|Motor vehicles|5 years|
|Office furniture, fittings and equipment|3 - 7 years|

Capital work-in-progress and capital inventories comprise mainly telecommunications equipment, information technology equipment and renovations. They are reclassified to the respective categories of property, plant and equipment and depreciated when they are ready for their intended use.

Residual values and useful lives are reassessed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date to ensure the amount and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in the statement of profit or loss.

Leased assets (including leasehold land) are presented as “right-of-use assets” in a separate line item in the statement of financial position.

# (c) Intangible assets

The Group acquires intangible assets either as part of a business combination or through separate acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition and recognised separately from goodwill. On initial acquisition, management judgment is applied to determine the appropriate allocation of purchase consideration to the assets being acquired, including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.

# (i) Spectrum rights

The Group’s spectrum rights consist of rights to spectrum bands previously acquired as part of a business combination and other spectrum rights.

For other spectrum rights, the intangible asset that is initially recognised at the date of acquisition includes an estimate for the future anticipated variable costs. Subsequent changes on such estimates will be recognised against the cost of the asset.

Spectrum rights are considered to have a finite life and thus are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit and assessed at each reporting date for any indication of impairment. Upon the expiry of the Spectrum Assignment (“SA”) periods, costs to renew spectrum rights that are previously acquired as part of a business combination are charged to the statement of profit or loss during the SA periods.

The estimated useful lives of the spectrum rights of the Group are as follows:

|Spectrum rights acquired as part of a business combination|15 - 16 years|
|---|---|
|Other spectrum rights|2 - 5 years|

The useful lives are reassessed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.

See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

# (ii) Other indefinite life intangible assets - telecommunications licences

Telecommunications licences comprise the rights that exist with the embedded approvals of the Government to allow Maxis to operate as one of the few mobile operators in Malaysia together with all the ancillary Network Facilities Provider (“NFP”), Network Service Provider (“NSP”) and Applications Service Provider (“ASP”) licences. The telecommunications licences were acquired as part of a business combination and are issued for a fixed period.

Telecommunications licences are considered to have an indefinite useful life if they can be renewed indefinitely without significant costs in comparison to the expected future economic benefits that the rights can generate for the Group. Therefore, the telecommunications licences are not amortised but tested for impairment on an annual basis, and where an indication of impairment exists.

See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

The indefinite useful life assumption applied to this acquired intangible assets is reassessed at each reporting date. When the expectation differs from previous estimates, the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.

# (iii) Goodwill

Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregation of the consideration transferred for purchase of subsidiaries or businesses, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of impairment testing. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets. Each CGU or a group of CGUs represents the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

# (iv) Software

Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.

Expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software programmes beyond their original specifications is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense when incurred.

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Software recognised as assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful economic lives of 2.5 – 8 years.

No amortisation is calculated on software development until the underlying software is completed and is ready for its intended use.

# (v) Customer relationships

Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. It has a finite useful life that ranges between 1 to 8 years and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefits and assessed at each reporting date whether any indication of impairment exists. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

# (d) Investments in subsidiaries

In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses plus the fair value of share grants over the Company’s equity in instruments for employees (including full-time executive directors) of the subsidiaries during the vesting period, deemed as capital contribution. See accounting policy Note 3(s)(iii) on share-based compensation benefits. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(f) on impairment of non-financial assets.

# (e) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or equity instrument of another enterprise.

A financial asset is any asset that is cash, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another enterprise, a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially favourable, or an equity instrument of another enterprise.

A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another enterprise, or to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially unfavourable.

# Financial assets

# (i) Classification

The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following measurement categories:

- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) or through profit or loss); and
- those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group and the Company have made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at FVOCI.

The Group and the Company reclassify debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

# (ii) Recognition and derecognition

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (e) Financial instruments (continued)

# Financial assets (continued)

# (iii) Measurement

At initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

# Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s and the Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify their debt instruments:

- Amortised cost:
- Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other operating expenses together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

FVOCI:
- Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other operating expenses. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other operating expenses and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

FVPL:

# Financial assets (continued)

# (iii) Measurement (continued)

# Equity instruments

The Group and the Company subsequently measure all equity instruments at fair value. Where the Group’s and the Company’s management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised within other operating expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.

# (iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (“ECL”) associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and at FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The Group has five types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

- Trade receivables
- Finance lease receivables
- Contract assets
- Other receivables and deposits
- Amounts due from related parties

The Company has two types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

- Other receivables and deposits
- Loans due from a subsidiary

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between present value of cash flows according to contract and present value of cash flows the Group expects to receive, over the remaining life of the financial instrument.

The measurement of ECL reflects:

- an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
- the time value of money; and
- reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

# (e) Financial instruments (continued)

# Financial assets (continued)

# (iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment (continued)

# (a) General 3-stage approach for other receivables, deposits, and loans to subsidiaries

At each reporting date, the Group measures ECL through loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL is required.

# (b) Simplified approach for trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties.

The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure ECL which uses a lifetime ECL for all the above.

# Significant increase in credit risk

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.

The following indicators are incorporated:

- internal credit rating; and
- actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations.

Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is incorporated as part of the internal rating model.

A significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making contractual payment.

# Definition of default and credit-impaired financial assets

The Group defines a financial instrument as default, when counterparty fails to make contractual payment more than 90 days after they fall due or the debtor is insolvent or has significant financial difficulties.

Financial instruments that are credit-impaired are assessed on individual basis.

For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties, balances that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis based on similar risk characteristics.

# (iv) Subsequent measurement - impairment (continued)

# Groupings of instruments for ECL measured on collective basis

# (a) Collective assessment

To measure ECL, trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics of customer’s behaviour and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled amounts and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

# (b) Individual assessment

Trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets, other receivables and deposits, related parties’ owings and loans due from a subsidiary that are in default or credit-impaired are assessed individually.

# Write-off

# (a) Trade receivables, finance lease receivables, contract assets and amounts due from related parties

The above is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group.

Impairment losses on the above are presented within ‘Impairment of receivables and deposits, net’ in the statements of profit or loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item in the statements of profit or loss.

# (b) Other receivables and deposits and loans due from a subsidiary

The Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The assessment of no reasonable expectation of recovery is based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount. The Group may write off financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity. These are presented as net impairment losses within ‘Impairment of receivables and deposits, net’ in the statements of profit or loss. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

# Financial liabilities

# (i) Classification and measurement

The Group and the Company classify their financial liabilities in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, other financial liabilities and financial guarantee contracts. Management determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.

The Group and the Company do not hold any financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss (except for derivative financial instruments and deferred contingent consideration arising from business combinations) and financial guarantee contracts. See accounting policy Note 3(g) on derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.

Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial liability and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Changes in the carrying value of these liabilities are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

The Group’s and the Company’s other financial liabilities comprise payables (including inter-companies and related parties’ balances) and borrowings in the statement of financial position. Financial liabilities are classified as current liabilities; except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, in which case they are classified as non-current liabilities.

# (ii) Recognition and derecognition

Financial liabilities are recognised when the Group and the Company become party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is either discharged, cancelled, expired or has been restructured with substantially different terms.

# Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

# (f) Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that have a finite economic useful life are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (“CGUs”). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

# (g) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (continued)

# Cash flow hedge (continued)

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the accounting of any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging included in equity depends on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. For cash flow hedge which resulted in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the cumulative amount in equity shall be included in the initial cost of the asset. For other cash flow hedges, the cumulative amount in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. When hedged future cash flows or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

The Group and the Company do not have any fair value hedges and net investment hedges.

# (h) Fair value estimates

The fair value of the financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments is estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes.

In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, the Group makes certain assumptions and applies the estimated discounted value of future cash flows to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows at the current interest rate available to the respective companies.

The face values for financial assets and financial liabilities with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to be approximately equal to their fair values.

For derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value, the fair values are determined using a valuation technique which utilises data from recognised financial information sources. Assumptions are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date. The fair values of interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flow using an appropriate market-based yield curve. The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are determined using the forward exchange rates as at each reporting date.

# (i) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the actual cost of materials and incidentals in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition, and is determined on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

# (j) Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, where they are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs.
# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (j) Trade and other receivables (continued)

After recognition, trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less loss allowance. See Note 3(e)(iv) for the impairment policy on receivables.

# (k) Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the rights to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Accounting as lessee

Leases are recognised as right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group (i.e. the commencement date).

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.

# (i) Lease term

In determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not to be terminated).

In determining the enforceable period of the lease, the Group considers the following:

- the broader economics of the contract, and not only contractual termination payments. If either party has an economic incentive not to terminate the lease such that it would incur a penalty on termination that is more than insignificant, the contract is deemed enforceable beyond the date on which the contract can be terminated; and
- whether each of the parties has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty. A lease is no longer enforceable only when both parties have such a right. Consequently, if only one party has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, the contract is deemed enforceable beyond the date on which the contract can be terminated by that party.

The Group reassesses the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances that is within the control of the Group and affects whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in the determination of lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in the determination of lease term. A revision in lease term results in remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

# (ii) ROU assets

ROU assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received;
- any initial direct costs; and
- decommissioning or restoration costs.

# Accounting as lessee (continued)

# (ii) ROU assets (continued)

ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. In addition, the ROU assets are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

The ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis, as follows:

|Land and network infrastructure|2 - 90 years|
|---|---|
|Offices and customer service centers|2 - 20 years|

# (iii) Lease liabilities

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include the following:

- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;
- the exercise price of extension options if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

The Group presents the lease liabilities within borrowings in the statement of financial position. Interest expense on the lease liability is presented within the finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.

Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. This is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the ROU in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

# (iv) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment, land and buildings, and network cell sites and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the statement of profit or loss.

# Accounting as a lessor

As a lessor, the Group determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

# Accounting as a lessor (continued)

# (i) Finance leases

The Group classifies a lease as a finance lease if the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.

The Group derecognises the underlying asset and recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in a finance lease. Net investment in a finance lease is measured at an amount equal to the sum of the present value of lease payments from the lessee and the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying asset. Initial direct costs are also included in the initial measurement of the net investment.

Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return. The Group revises the lease income allocation if there is a reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual value.

# (ii) Operating leases

The Group classifies a lease as an operating lease if the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.

The Group recognises lease payments received under an operating lease as lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature.

# (iii) Separating lease and non-lease components

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on the stand-alone selling prices in accordance with the principles in MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.

# (l) Loans to subsidiaries

Loans to subsidiaries are recognised initially at fair value. If there are any differences between cash disbursed and fair value on initial recognition, the difference would be accounted as additional investment in the subsidiary as it reflects the substance of the transaction.

Loans to subsidiaries are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less loss allowance. See Note 3(e)(iv) for the impairment policy on receivables.

# (m) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities on the statement of financial position. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of deposits with maturity more than three months.

# (n) Share capital

# (i) Classification

Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares with discretionary dividends are classified as equity. Other shares are classified as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument. Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.

# (ii) Share issue costs

External costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted, net of tax, against proceeds and shown in equity.

# (o) Payables

Payables, including accruals, represent liabilities for goods received and services rendered to the Group and the Company prior to the end of the financial year and which remain unpaid. Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Payables are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred, which include transfer taxes and duties. Payables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# (p) Borrowings

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss when incurred.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Interest expense, losses and gains relating to a financial instrument, or a component part, classified as a liability is reported within finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.

Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss within finance costs.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (p) Borrowings (continued)

# (i) Borrowings in a designated hedging relationship

Borrowings subject to cash flow hedges are recognised initially at fair value based on the applicable interest rate plus any transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of borrowing. These borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised costs. Any difference between the final amount paid to discharge the borrowing and the initial proceeds is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.

Interest expense on the borrowings are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, along with the associated gains or losses on the hedging instrument, which have been reclassified from the cash flow hedging reserve to the statement of profit or loss.

# (ii) Borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship

Borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of borrowing. These borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised costs. Any difference between the final amount paid to discharge the borrowing and the initial proceeds is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.

# (q) Provisions for liabilities and charges

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.

Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. When it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

# (i) Site rectification and decommissioning works

Provision for site rectification works is based on management’s best estimate and the past trend of costs for rectification works to be carried out to fulfil new regulatory guidelines and requirements imposed after network cell sites were built.

Provision for decommissioning works is the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the structures on identified sites and restoring these sites. This obligation is incurred either when the items are installed or as a consequence of having used the items during a particular period.

The estimated amount is determined after taking into consideration the time value of money, risks specific to the provision and the current conditions of the sites. The initial estimated amount is capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment.

# (q) Provisions for liabilities and charges (continued)

# (ii) Staff incentive scheme

Provision for staff incentive scheme is based on management’s best estimate of the total employee benefits payable as at reporting date based on the service and/or performance conditions of individual employees and/or financial performance of the Group.

# (iii) Separation benefits

Provision for staff mutual separation scheme is based on management’s best estimate of the total employee benefits payable based on the number of consecutive years of employment with the Group.

# (r) Income taxes

The tax expenses for the period comprise current and deferred tax. The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. Tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current tax expenses are determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group operates and include all taxes based upon the taxable profits, and real property gains taxes payable on disposal of properties.

Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts attributed to assets and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, investment tax allowance or unused tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries only to the extent that it is probable the temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.

Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets shall reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the entity expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (r) Income taxes (continued)

Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority or either the taxable entity or different taxable entities when there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

# (s) Employee benefits

# (i) Short-term employee benefits

Salaries, paid annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits that are expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.

# (ii) Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis, and the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the period to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations. The Group recognises a provision when an employee has provided services in exchange for employee benefits to be paid in the future. When contributions to a defined contribution plan are not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service, they shall be discounted to present value.

# (iii) Share-based compensation benefits

The Group and the Company operate equity-settled, share-based compensation plans for eligible employees (including full-time executive directors) of the Group and of the Company, pursuant to the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and incentive arrangement.

Where the Group and the Company pay for services of employees using the share grants, the fair value of the share grants which is determined using the observable market price of the shares at the grant date is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting periods, with a corresponding increase in equity.

When the shares of the Company are acquired from the open market at market price using cash incentive payable to employees under the incentive arrangement, the transactions are recorded in share-based payments reserve and are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting periods.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and the number of shares that are expected to vest by the vesting date. At each reporting date, the Group and the Company revise this estimated number of shares and any revision of this estimate is included in the statement of profit or loss and with the corresponding adjustment in equity.

# (s) Employee benefits (continued)

# (iii) Share-based compensation benefits (continued)

Non-market-vesting conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value. Non-market vesting and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest.

When share grants are forfeited due to failure by the employee to satisfy the service and/or performance conditions, any expenses previously recognised in relation to such share grants are reversed effective on the date of the forfeiture.

If the share grants expire or lapse, the corresponding share-based payments reserve attributable to the share grants are transferred to retained earnings.

In the separate financial statements of the Company, the fair value of the share grants offered to employees of the subsidiary in exchange for the services of employees to the subsidiary are treated as a capital contribution and thus recognised as investment in subsidiary, with a corresponding credit to equity.

# (iv) Separation benefits

Separation benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

The Group recognises separation benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of MFRS 137 and involves the payment of separation benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the separation benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.

# (t) Income recognition

# (i) Revenue from contract with customers

Telecommunications revenue

Revenue from prepaid services is recognised when services are rendered. Consideration from the sale of prepaid sim cards and reload vouchers to customers where services have not been rendered at the reporting date is deferred as contract liability until actual usage or when the cards, vouchers or reloaded amounts are expired or forfeited.

Postpaid services are provided in postpaid packages which consist of a series of promised services including voice, data, text, digital and other converged telecommunications services. As the services are separately identifiable and the customers can benefit from each of the services on its own, each service is accounted for as a separate performance obligation.

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# 3. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (t) Income recognition (continued)

# (i) Revenue from contract with customers (continued)

# Telecommunications revenue (continued)

For postpaid usage-based plans, revenue is recognised when the customers use the services and is measured at the consideration specified in the contract.

Fixed fee postpaid service plans may include services which provide customers with limited and unlimited usage for the respective services within the plan. For services with unlimited usage, revenue is recognised proportionately over the fixed fee billing period based on the consideration allocated for the service. For services with limited usage, revenue is recognised when the customer utilises their entitled usage and is measured based on the consideration allocated for the service. Services with limited usage can be utilised up to the end of the fixed fee period. At the end of the fixed fee period, the remaining consideration allocated for the service which has not been utilised is recognised as revenue in full.

The consideration specified in the contract is adjusted for expected discounts and rebates for contracts which offer discounted rates when certain volume commitments are met, to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method. As the amount billed to customer is higher than the transaction price, a contract liability is recognised.

Postpaid packages are either sold separately or bundled together with the sale of a device to a customer. Devices can also be obtained separately from other device retailers and can be used together with the postpaid packages provided by the Group. As postpaid packages and devices are capable of being distinct and separately identifiable, there are two performance obligations within a bundled transaction. Accordingly, the Group allocates the transaction price based on the relative stand-alone selling prices (“RSSP”) of the postpaid packages and device.

Stand-alone selling prices are based on observable sales prices; however, where stand-alone selling prices are not directly observable, estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.

# Sale of device

Revenue from sale of device is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, usually on delivery and acceptance of the device.

Payment for the transaction price of the device is typically collected at the point the customer signs up for the bundled contract, except for bundled packages that have a payment structure allowing customers to pay for the device over a period of up to 36 months. For these arrangements, the Group discounts the transaction price using the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between the Group and its customers at contract inception, to take into consideration the significant financing component. The financing component is recognised as interest revenue over the contract period and presented as part of the revenue of the Group.

A contract asset is recognised when the Group delivers the devices before the payment is due. If the payment happens before the delivery of the device then a contract liability is recognised. Contract assets and contract liabilities are presented within receivables and payables respectively in the statement of financial position.

# (i) Revenue from contract with customers (continued)

# Sale of device (continued)

Devices and equipment that are transferred as part of a fixed line telecommunications services bundled package which can only be used together with the services provided by the Group, are considered as a single performance obligation in telecommunications services revenue.

The contract for sale of devices does not give the customers a right of return nor responsibilities within the ambit of device manufacturer’s warranty.

When another party is involved in providing devices to a customer, the Group is a principal in such arrangements when it controls the devices before they are transferred to the customers. As the principal, the Group recognises revenue on the gross consideration allocated to the devices with the corresponding direct costs of satisfying the contract.

# Customer loyalty programme

The Group operates a loyalty programme which may provide the customers a material right to acquire future products and services from the Group or selected partner vendors of the Group for free or at a discount.

Where there is a material right to the customer, a portion of the consideration specified in the contract is allocated to the material right on an RSSP basis. The consideration allocated is recognised as a contract liability. Revenue is only recognised when the material rights such as free goods or discounts are redeemed or expired.

# (ii) Interest revenue

Interest revenue on receivables from contracts with customers with significant financing components is recognised over the customer’s contract period using an effective interest rate reflecting the customers’ credit risk.

# (iii) Contract assets

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are presented within “Receivables, deposits and prepayments” of the statement of financial position.

# (iv) Contract liabilities

Contract liability is the unsatisfied obligation by the Group to transfer goods or services to customer for which the Group has received the consideration in advance or has billed the customer, whichever is earlier. Contract liabilities are presented within “Payables and accruals” of the statement of financial position.

Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

# (t) Income recognition (continued)

# (v) Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s and the Company’s right to receive payment is established.

# (vi) Interest income

Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group and the Company.

# (u) Incremental costs incurred to acquire a contract

The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, sales commissions are recognised as contract cost assets as these are incremental costs that would not have been incurred by the Group if the respective contracts had not been obtained. The Group expects to recover these costs in the future through telecommunications services revenue earned from the customer. These are amortised consistently over the term of the specific contract to which the cost relates to.

Where the costs incurred to acquire a contract are in respect of contracts with amortisation period of less than one year, these are recognised as an expense when incurred in line with the practical expedient elected by the Group.

Amortisation of contract acquisition costs is presented within traffic, device, commissions and other direct costs within the statement of profit or loss.

An impairment loss is recognised to profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost asset recognised exceeds the remaining amount of considerations that the Group expects to receive for the specific contract that the cost relate to less additional costs required to complete the specific contract.

# (v) Deferred income – Government grant

As a Universal Service Provider, the Group is entitled to claim certain qualified expenses from the relevant authorities in relation to Universal Service Provider projects. The claim qualifies as a government grant and is recognised at its fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with all the attached conditions.

Government grants relating to costs are recognised as income in the statement of profit or loss to match them with the expenses they are intended to compensate in the period they are incurred.

Government grants relating to the purchase of assets are included in non-current liabilities in the statement of financial position as deferred income and are credited to the statement of profit or loss as income on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the corresponding assets.

# (w) Contingent liabilities

The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare circumstance where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably.

# (x) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-makers comprising the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for allocating resources, assessing performance of the operating segments and making strategic decisions.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

# Critical accounting estimates and judgments

The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equal the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s results and financial position are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.

# Critical accounting estimates and judgments – Group

# (a) Impairment assessment of intangible assets - goodwill

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequent if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. When performing an impairment testing, the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations require management’s estimates and are sensitive to changes in compounded revenue and EBITDA (i.e. profit before finance income, finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation and allowance for write down of identified network costs) annual growth rates in the projection period, post-tax discount rate and terminal growth rate. See Note 16 to the financial statements for the key assumptions on the impairment assessment of goodwill.

# Critical accounting estimates and judgments - Group (continued)

# (b) Estimated useful lives and impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets - software

The Group reviews annually the estimated useful lives and assesses for indicators of impairment of property, plant and equipment and software within the intangible assets based on factors such as business plans and strategies, historical sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, regulatory landscape, expected level of usage, future technological developments and other available information. It is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these estimates brought about by changes in the factors mentioned. Any impairment or reduction in the estimated useful lives would increase charges to the statement of profit or loss and decrease their carrying value. See Note 15 and 16 to the financial statements for the impact of the changes in the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

# (c) Provisions for liabilities and charges

The Group recognises provisions for liabilities and charges when it has a present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made. The recording of provision requires the application of judgments about the ultimate resolution of these obligations. As a result, provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the Group’s current best estimate. See Note 27 to the financial statements for the impact on changes in estimates.

# (d) Revenue recognition for contracts with customers

# Identification of performance obligation

Certain contracts with customers are bundled packages that may include sale of products and telecommunications services that comprise voice, data and other converged telecommunications and solutions services. The Group accounts for individual products and services separately as separate performance obligations if they are distinct promised goods and services, i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it separately. The Group exercises judgments to identify if products and services within the bundled package are distinct as separate promised products and services. This determination will affect the allocation of consideration specified in the contract and the revenue recognised for each performance obligation.

# Principal versus agent

The Group is a principal for sale of devices as the Group controls the device before it is transferred to the customer. In making such an assessment, the Group takes into consideration both the legal form of the contract with its customer and supplier. Revenue from sale of device is recognised on a gross basis and payment to the supplier for device cost is recorded as a direct cost.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Critical accounting estimates and judgments - Group (continued)

# (d) Revenue recognition for contracts with customers (continued)

Determining stand-alone selling price (“SSP”)

The Group has assessed that there are two performance obligations for bundled contracts where the Group needs to allocate the transaction price between the postpaid service and device based on their relative SSP.

SSP for postpaid packages and devices are based on observable sales prices; however, where certain SSP are not directly observable, estimates will be made maximizing the use of observable inputs.

The estimation of SSP is a significant estimate as it will directly determine the amount of revenue to be recognised up front (sale of device) and amount of revenue to be recognised over time (telecommunications revenue). For example, a lower SSP for device will result in a lower amount of revenue recognised up front and higher amount of revenue recognised over the contract period.

# (e) Income taxes

Significant estimation is involved in determining the Group’s provision for income taxes as there are certain transactions and computations for which the final tax determination is uncertain at the reporting date. The Group applies consistent tax treatment on such transactions and computations when determining the Group’s provision for income taxes for all years of assessment.

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

# (f) Determining the lease term where the Group acts as a lessee

In determining the lease term and assessing the length of the non-cancellable period of a lease, the Group applies the definition of a contract and determines the period for which the contract is enforceable. However, for leases of certain telecommunications network sites, the contract contains an exit clause that is exercisable by both the lessee and lessor with a short notification period. For such contracts, the Group considers whether the lessee and lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without the permission from the other party with no more than an insignificant penalty, in determining the lease term. In determining a penalty, the Group assesses monetary and non-monetary considerations which include amongst others, network cell site relocation effort.

The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

The determination of the lease term is a significant judgment as it will directly affect the recognition of a lease as a short term lease or a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability. For example, a short term lease is recognised as an expense in the profit or loss throughout the lease term while a lease recognised as a right-of-use asset is capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term with a corresponding lease liability measured at the present value of the lease payments.

(g) Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables and contract assets

The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets. To measure the expected loss rates, trade receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. These historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables such as unemployment rate, interest rate and economic outlook. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The Group estimates the relationship between historical loss rates and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors and ECL which may not be representative of a customer’s actual default in the future.

# Critical accounting estimates and judgments - Company

(a) Investments in subsidiaries

The Company will assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the investment in subsidiaries may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company will perform an impairment assessment on the carrying amount of its investment against its recoverable amount.

The key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount require management’s estimates and are sensitive to changes in compounded revenue and EBITDA annual growth rates in the projection period, post-tax discount rate and terminal growth rate. See Note 18 to the financial statements for the key assumptions on the impairment assessment of the investments in subsidiaries.

# 5. SEGMENT REPORTING

Segment reporting is not presented as the Group is primarily engaged in providing converged telecommunications services and solutions in Malaysia, whereby the measurement of profit or loss including EBIT (i.e. profit before finance income, finance costs and tax expenses) that is used by the chief operating decision-makers is on a Group basis.

The Group’s operations are mainly in Malaysia. In determining the geographical segments of the Group, revenues are based on the country in which the customer or international operator is located. Non-current assets by geographical segments are not disclosed as all operations of the Group are based in Malaysia.

# (b) Diluted earnings per share

For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issuance of the Company is adjusted to assume full conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares to be issued by the Company.

Share grants are treated as contingently issuable shares because their issuance is contingent upon satisfying specified vesting conditions comprising, amongst others, performance targets and/or conditions, as disclosed in Note 31(a) to the financial statements, in addition to the passage of time. They are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share where the vesting conditions would not have been satisfied as at the end of the financial year.

Included in the carrying value of goodwill are:

1. RM9,530 million (2022: RM9,530 million) that arose from the Company’s acquisition of the entire issued and paid-up share capital of the subsidiaries previously held by Maxis Communication Berhad (“MCB”) pursuant to a restructuring exercise completed in financial year 2009 to consolidate the telecommunications operations in Malaysia under the Company (“Pre-Listing Restructuring”); and
2. RM155 million (2022: RM155 million) that arose from the acquisition of other businesses. These businesses provide synergy to the Group’s existing business.

# 16€ INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

# (b) Spectrum rights

Spectrum rights consist of rights to spectrum bands previously acquired during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise in financial year 2009 and it includes the frequency band of 900MHz and 2100MHz. As disclosed in Note 21(c) to the financial statements, these spectrums were reissued to the Group in the form of Spectrum Assignment (“SA”) with some upfront price component fees for which the Group has paid in full (“SA fee paid”).

In the current financial year, the Group:

- revised the useful lives of certain software assets ranging from 5 to 8 years to remaining useful lives ranging from 2.5 to 3 years. The revision was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and as a result, the amortisation charge for the financial year has increased by RM47 million.
- recognised impairment on goodwill of RM2 million as the carrying amount of goodwill relating to a subsidiary exceeds its recoverable amount.

In the previous financial year, the Group revised the useful lives of certain software assets from 36 months to 30 months. The revision was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and as a result, the amortisation charge increased by RM12 million.

# Impairment testing for CGU containing goodwill and telecommunications licences

For the purpose of impairment testing, the carrying amounts of goodwill and telecommunications licences are allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on internally approved financial budgets covering a five-year (2022: five-year) period.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are as follows:

- compounded revenue and EBITDA annual growth rates of 3.9% and 4.0% (2022: 5.7% and 1.0%) respectively and capital expenditure for five years financial budget period which reflect management’s expectations based on past experience and estimated 5G single wholesale network (“SWN”) costs, current regulatory landscape and future expectations of business performance;
- post-tax discount rate of 8.3% (2022: 8.8%). In accordance with the requirements of MFRS 136 “Impairment of Assets”, this translates into a pre-tax discount rate of 12.7% (2022: 12.5%). The discount rates used reflect specific risks relating to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU;
- terminal growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.7%) represents the growth rate applied to extrapolate pre-tax cash flow beyond the five (2022: five) year financial budget period. This growth rate is based on management’s assessment of future trends in the mobile telecommunications industry, the operating and regulatory landscape under SWN, new growth opportunities in fixed broadband and enterprise business, using both external and internal sources.

Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Directors have concluded that any variation of 10% (2022: 10%) in the base case assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

# 18 INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Investments in subsidiaries (continued)

During the current financial year, the net asset of certain subsidiaries were lower than the carrying amount of the investments. Thus, the Company has carried out the following:

1. Investment in a subsidiary is tested for impairment whereby the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations as disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements, adjusted for the financing cash flows forecast of the subsidiary. No impairment charge was recognised as the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the Directors have concluded that any variation of 7.8% (2022: 4%) in the base case assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of the investment to exceed its recoverable amount.
2. Investments in other two subsidiaries were tested for impairment and the Company recognised impairment losses of RM18 million on the investments as the carrying amount of the investment exceeded the recoverable amount.

In the previous financial year, dividends totaling to RM65 million that were received from the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Maxis Mobile Services Sdn Bhd (“MMSSB”) were recognised as return of capital thereby reducing the costs of investments. Additionally, the Company received RM258 million from MMSSB arising from its capital reduction exercise.

The 2015 Scheme and 2023 Scheme are governed by the By-Laws which were approved by the shareholders on 28 April 2015 and 18 May 2023 respectively and is administered by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee which is appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company, in accordance with the By-Laws. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee may from time to time, offer LTIP to eligible employees (including executive director) of the Group and includes any person who is proposed to be employed as an employee of the Group (including executive director).

The LTIP comprises a Performance Share Grant (“PS Grant”) and a Restricted Share Grant (“RS Grant”). The salient features of the LTIP are as follows:

The maximum number of new shares which may be made available under the LTIP and/or allotted and issued upon vesting of the new shares under the LTIP shall not, when aggregated with the total number of new shares allotted and issued under the existing Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”), exceed 250,000,000 shares at any point of time during the duration of the LTIP. The ESOS had expired in 2019;
2. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee shall decide from time to time at its discretion to determine or vary the terms and conditions of the offer, such as eligibility criteria and allocation for each grant (i.e. the entitlement to receive new shares under the LTIP), the timing and frequency of the award of the grant, the performance target and/or performance conditions to be met prior to offer and vesting of the grant and the vesting period;
3. The total number of new shares that may be offered under the LTIP shall be at the discretion of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee;
4. In the event of any alteration in the capital structure of the Company except under certain circumstances, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee may make or provide for alterations or adjustments to be made in the number of unvested new shares and/or the method and/or manner in the vesting of the new shares comprised in a grant;
5. The 2015 Scheme commenced from 31 July 2015, while the 2023 Scheme commenced from 3 July 2023, the effective dates of the implementation of the LTIP. The LTIP shall be in force for a period of 10 years from the implementation date;
6. The new shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the LTIP shall, upon allotment and issuance, rank equally in all respects with the then existing issued shares and the grant holders shall not be entitled to any dividends, rights, allotments, entitlements and/or any other distributions, for which the entitlement date is prior to the date of issue of the shares;
7. The share grants will only be vested to the eligible employees of the Group (including an executive director) who have duly accepted the offer of grants under the LTIP, on their respective vesting dates, provided the following vesting conditions are fully and duly satisfied:
- eligible employees of the Group (including an executive director) must remain in employment with the Group and shall not have given notice of resignation or received a notice of termination of service as at the vesting dates or have left the Group before time of vesting except on a “Good Leaver” basis.

# (a)€ Merger€relief

The merger relief was created prior to the listing and quotation exercise of the Company’s shares on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad in financial year 2009 (“Listing”) during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise. Pursuant to Section 60(4)(a) of the Companies Act, 1965, the premium on the shares issued by the Company as consideration for the acquisition of the subsidiaries is not recorded as share premium. The difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued is classified as merger relief.

# (b)€ Reserve€arising€from€reverse€acquisition

The reserve arising from reverse acquisition was created during the Pre-Listing Restructuring exercise where MMSSB was identified as the accounting acquirer in accordance to MFRS 3 “Business Combination”. The difference between the issued equity of the Company and issued equity of MMSSB together with the deemed purchase consideration of subsidiaries other than MMSSB and the cash distribution to MCB, is recorded as reserve arising from reverse acquisition.

The cash flow hedging reserve represents the deferred fair value gain/(loss) relating to derivative financial instruments used to hedge certain foreign currency transactions of the Group.

# 33 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group’s and the Company’s activities expose them to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group’s and the Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s and the Company’s financial performances. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge designated risk exposures of the underlying hedge items and does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

The Group and the Company have established financial risk management policies and procedures/mandates which provide written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and use of derivative financial instruments.

# (a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flow of the financial instruments that will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. The various components of market risk that the Group and the Company are exposed to are discussed below.

# (i) Foreign exchange risk

The objectives of the Group’s and of the Company’s currency risk management policies are to allow the Group and the Company to effectively manage the foreign exchange fluctuation against its functional currency that may arise from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage foreign exchange exposures arising from all known material foreign currency denominated commitments as and when they arise and to hedge the movements in exchange rates by establishing the rate at which a foreign currency monetary item will be settled. Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts entered into as hedges of foreign currency monetary items are recognised in the financial statements when the exchange differences of the hedged monetary items are recognised in the financial statements.

The sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax for the financial year and equity to a reasonably possible change in the USD exchange rate against the functional currency, RM, with all other factors remaining constant and based on the composition of assets and liabilities at the reporting date are set out as below.

| |Impact on profit before tax for the financial year| |Impact on equity(1)| | | |

| |- weakened 5% (2022: 5%)| |*|1|(6)|(5)|

Notes:

- (1) Represents cash flow hedging reserve
- * Less than RM1 million

The impacts on profit before tax for the financial year are mainly as a result of foreign currency gains/losses on translating of USD denominated receivables, deposits, bank balances and unhedged payables. For USD payables in a designated hedging relationship, as these are effectively hedged, the foreign currency movements will not have any impact on the statement of profit or loss.

# (ii) Interest rate risk

The Group’s interest rate risk arises from deposits with licensed banks, trade payables under supplier financing and borrowings carrying fixed and variable interest rates and for the Company, from its deposits with licensed banks and intercompany loans. The objectives of the Group’s interest rate risk management policies are to allow the Group to effectively manage the interest rate fluctuation through the use of fixed and floating interest rates debt and derivative financial instruments. The Group adopts a non-speculative stance which favours predictability over interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate profiles of the Group’s borrowings are also regularly reviewed against prevailing and anticipated market interest rates to determine whether refinancing or early repayment is warranted.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 33 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

# (a) Market risk (continued)

# (ii) Interest rate risk (continued)

The impact on profit before tax for the financial year is mainly as a result of interest expenses on floating rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship. For borrowings in a designated hedging relationship in the previous financial year, as these were effectively hedged, the interest rate movements will not have any impact on the statement of profit or loss.

# (b) Credit risk

The objectives of the Group’s and of the Company’s credit risk management policies are to manage their exposure to credit risk from deposits, cash and bank balances, receivables, contract assets and derivative financial instruments. They do not expect any third parties to fail to meet their obligations given the Group’s and the Company’s policies of selecting creditworthy counterparties.

# Trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets

Credit risk of receivables and contract assets is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risks are minimised and monitored via limiting the Group’s dealings with creditworthy business partners and customers. Receivables and contract assets are monitored on an ongoing basis via the Group’s management reporting and dunning procedures.

# Concentration of credit risk

The Group has no significant exposure to any individual customer, geographical location or industry category. Significant credit and recovery risks associated with receivables and contract assets have been provided for in the financial statements.

# Impairment of trade receivables, finance lease receivables and contract assets

The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. To measure the ECL, receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The expected loss rates are determined based on 5-year historical ageing profile and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables and contract assets. Some of the factors which the Group has identified include unemployment rate, Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and annual Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth and has adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in such factors.

For deposits, cash and bank balances, the Group and the Company seek to ensure that cash assets are invested safely and profitably by assessing counterparty risks and allocating placement limits for various creditworthy financial institutions.

While deposits, cash and bank balances are also subject to the impairment requirements, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.

# Derivative financial instruments

The Group enters into the contracts with various reputable counterparties to minimise the credit risks. The Group considers the risk of material loss in the event of non-performance by the above parties to be unlikely. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of those financial instruments.

# (c) Liquidity risk

The objectives of the Group’s and of the Company’s liquidity risk management policies are to monitor rolling forecasts of the Group’s and of the Company’s liquidity requirements to ensure they have sufficient cash to meet operational and financing needs as and when they fall due, availability of funding via credit lines, whilst meeting external debt covenant compliance. Surplus cash held is invested in interest bearing money market deposits and time deposits. The Group and the Company are exposed to liquidity risk where there may be difficulty in raising funds to meet such financial commitments.

# (d) Capital risk management

The Group’s and the Company’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group’s and the Company’s abilities to continue as a going concern while at the same time provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to optimise its capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, increase or reduce its long-term borrowings, issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.

Under the requirement of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Practice Note No. 17/2005, the Company is required to maintain a consolidated shareholders’ equity of more than 25% of the issued and paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) and maintain such shareholders’ equity of not less than RM40 million. The Company has complied with this requirement.

External lenders require the borrower, MBSB, to maintain financial covenant ratios on its net debt to EBITDA and EBITDA to interest expense. These financial covenant ratios have been fully complied with by MBSB for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.

The Group also monitors its capital structure which comprises borrowings and equity on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity attributable to equity holders of the Company. Net debt is calculated as total interest bearing financial liabilities comprising the sum of borrowings and derivative financial instruments designated in hedging relationship on borrowings on a net basis (if any) but excluding trade payables under supplier financing as disclosed in Note 28 to the financial statements less deposits, cash and bank balances. Total equity is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the statements of financial position. The gearing ratios at reporting dates were as follows:

|Total equity attributable to equity holders of the Company|5,743|6,089|
|Gearing ratio|1.6|1.5|

# (e) Fair value estimation

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

# (i) Financial instruments carried at amortised cost

The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group at the reporting date approximated their fair values except as set out below measured using Level 3 valuation technique:

|Group|2023 Carrying amount RM’million|Fair value RM’million|2022 Carrying amount RM’million|Fair value RM’million|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Financial liability: Borrowings - Islamic Medium Term Notes|6,206|6,215|4,789|4,834|

The valuation technique used to derive the Level 3 disclosure for financial liability is based on the estimated cash flow and discount rate of the Group.

# 36 RESTATEMENT OF COMPARATIVES

The Group is required to make annual contributions to the Universal Service Provision Fund (“USP Fund”) in accordance with the Communications and Multimedia (USP) Regulations 2002 (“the Regulations”), as the Group is a holder of Network Facilities Provider (“NFP”) and Network Service Provider (“NSP”) individual licences whose total net revenue derived from the designated services exceeds the minimum revenue thresholds stated in the Regulations. The contribution to the USP Fund (“the USP levy”) is calculated based on 6% of its weighted net revenue derived from designated services. The contribution is payable to the USP Fund in the following calendar year.

In the current financial year, the timing of recognition for the USP levy liability was changed when the Group reassessed the interpretation of the Regulations. Accordingly, the USP levy liability is recognised when net revenue is derived from designated services during the current financial year. The USP levy liability was previously recognised when the contribution was payable to the USP Fund. Consequently, during the financial year, the Group restated the comparatives to recognise the additional accrual of the USP levy liability.

The impacts of the above restatement of comparatives to the Group’s statements of financial position, statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows for the prior financial years are follows:

# 38€ ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES

In the previous financial year, the Group has acquired the below subsidiaries:

# (i) Enterprise Managed Services Sdn. Bhd. (formerly known as Mykris Asia Sdn. Bhd.) (“EMS”)

On 14 January 2022, the Group acquired the entire share capital of EMS, a company that provides managed network services and security solutions, to reinforce the Group’s capacity and capabilities to support its Enterprise customers. The maximum purchase consideration is RM158 million which comprises a base consideration of up to RM115 million and subsequent payments of up to RM43 million payable over 3 years upon achieving certain financial performance targets.

The details of net assets acquired and net cash outflow on acquisition of EMS is analysed as follows:

|As at date of acquisition RM’million|As at date of acquisition RM’million|
|---|
|Purchase consideration comprises:| |
|Cash paid|107|
|Contingent consideration|10|
|Total|117|
|Net assets:| |
|Intangible assets|15|
|Receivables|8|
|Property, plant and equipment|2|
|Deferred tax assets|1|
|Deferred tax liabilities|(4)|
|Other net identifiable assets|(5)|
|Less: impairment of receivables|(2)|
|Goodwill on acquisition|102|

The fair value of the assets and liabilities ensuing from the acquisition had been determined based on fair values assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition date. The residual goodwill on acquisition represents the value of assets and earnings that do not form separable assets under MFRS 3 but nevertheless are expected to contribute to the future results of the Group.

Contribution of revenue and expenses to the Group is recognised from the beginning of the financial year in which EMS was acquired. Consequently, EMS’ revenue of RM45 million and net profit of RM5 million for the period from 15 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 have been included in the statement of profit or loss of the Group. These results are not significantly different if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2022.

# (ii) Gurulab Sdn. Bhd. (“GSB”)

On 6 May 2022, the Group acquired 59% share capital of GSB, a new Edutech startup for a cash consideration of RM4 million with a RM2 million goodwill recognised.

(iii) ComeBy Sdn. Bhd. (“CSB”)

On 30 June 2022, the Group acquired 56% share capital of CSB, a retail solution company for a cash consideration of RM5 million with a RM2 million goodwill recognised.

Contribution of revenue and expenses from the beginning of the financial year in which GSB and CSB were acquired is not significant to the Group.

# 39 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR

During the year, Maxis Broadband Sdn Bhd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company:

- (a) executed the Access Agreement with DNB on 14 August 2023 to subscribe to 5G Products and Services provided by DNB on a wholesale basis including the National 5G Wholesale Network Product; and
- (b) entered into conditional share subscription agreement (“SSA”) on 1 December 2023 with DNB and Minister of Finance, Incorporated (“MOF”) to subscribe for equity stake in DNB (“Proposed Investment”). The Proposed Investment involves the subscription of 100,000 new ordinary shares in DNB, at an issue price of RM1 each payable upon satisfaction of (i) conditions precedent stated in SSA; and (ii) prepayment towards products and services to be delivered by DNB pursuant to the Access Agreement signed above amounting to RM233,233,333.

In our opinion, the financial statements of Maxis Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policies and other explanatory information, as set out on pages 106 to 206.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

We performed the following audit procedures on the value in-use (“VIU”) calculations which were based on pre-tax cash flow projections based on internally approved financial budgets covering a five-year period:

- Refer to Note 3(c) - Summary of material accounting policies:

Based on the annual impairment test performed, the Directors concluded no impairment is required for goodwill and telecommunications licences allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions cash generating unit (“CGU”). The key assumptions and sensitivities are disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements.

- Agreed the five-year VIU cash flows to the financial budgets covering a five-year period from 2024, approved by the Directors for impairment assessment;
- Compared the historical forecast for 2023 to actual results to assess the reliability of management’s estimates;
- Compared the compounded revenue growth rates in the projection periods to historical results and telecommunications industry forecasts; and
- Checked the mathematical accuracy of the five-year VIU cash flows.

• Agreed the assumption on capital expenditures and operating expenditures to the financial budgets covering a five-year period from 2024 approved by the Directors, discussed with management on the capital expenditures and operating expenditures required to maintain the network performance, and assessed the impact on the VIU cash flows;

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

We performed the following audit procedures on the value in-use (“VIU”) calculations which were based on pre-tax cash flow projections based on internally approved financial budgets covering a five-year period: (continued)

- Checked the reasonableness of the discount rate and terminal growth rate with the assistance of our valuation experts by benchmarking to industry reports; and
- Checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management on the discount rate and terminal growth rate.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions to the Directors’ conclusion that the goodwill and telecommunications licences allocated to the converged telecommunications services and solutions CGU is not impaired as at 31 December 2023.

# Revenue recognition from contracts with customers

We performed the following audit procedures:

Refer to Note 3(t) - Summary of material accounting policies: Income recognition, Note 4(d) - Critical accounting estimates and judgements: Revenue recognition for contracts with customers and Note 6 - Revenue

The Group’s revenue from contracts with customers of RM10.0 billion during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 comprised primarily of telecommunications services and solutions revenue, and sales of devices of RM8.4 billion and RM1.6 billion respectively.

We focused on this area because there is an inherent risk around the accuracy of revenue recorded given the complexity of systems and the impact of various pricing models for different revenue products to revenue recognition. Revenue processed by billing systems is complex and involves large volumes of data with different products and services sold, and price changes.

- Authorisation of rate changes and the input of this information to the billing systems; and
- Accuracy of calculation of amounts billed to customers;

For material revenue streams, we obtained supporting evidence such as customer contracts, invoices and relevant supporting documents to test the accuracy of revenue recognition on a sampling basis;

Reviewed management’s assessment of the identification of separate performance obligations over material customer contracts with bundling arrangements and sighted to the customer contracts on a sampling basis; and

Reviewed management’s analysis in determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in relation to the sale of devices based on the contractual terms and conditions in the contracts with customers and suppliers.

# Revenue recognition from contracts with customers (continued)

In addition, management exercises judgement in the areas below:

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions in the revenue recognised during the financial year.

- Certain contracts with customers are bundled packages that may include sale of products and telecommunications services and solutions that comprise voice, data and other converged telecommunications services;
- Individual products and services are accounted for as separate performance obligations if they are distinct promised goods and services. Judgement is involved in identifying if products and services with the bundled package are distinct as separate promised products and services; and
- Determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in relation to the sale of devices.

# Assessment of funding requirements and ability to meet the short term obligations

Refer to Note 33(c) - Financial Risk Management: Liquidity Risk

As at 31 December 2023, the Group had short term payables and accruals of RM4.13 billion and short term borrowings of RM0.86 billion. We focused on the Group’s funding and ability to meet its short term obligations due to the significant amount of the short term liabilities, which resulted in the current liabilities of the Group exceeding current assets by RM2.38 billion at that date. The Group’s ability to obtain funding from existing facilities is disclosed in Note 33 (c) to the financial statements.

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Checked the extent of debt that the Group can raise from its existing facilities;
- Reviewed management’s assessment of compliance with debt covenants;
- Checked the borrowing repayment profile of the Group against the debt agreements;
- Checked management’s cash flow forecasts for the Group over the period of 12 months from the date of the financial statements to the annual budget approved by the Directors and cash flow projections prepared by management which includes operating, investing and financing cash flows; and
- Discussed with management on key assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts including cash collection trends, payment profiles and significant transactions that may occur in developing the cash flow forecasts for the Group.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions to the Directors’ assessment that the Group will be able to meet its short term obligations.

Recoverability of the carrying value of cost of investment in a subsidiary

Refer to Note 3(f) - Summary of material accounting policies: Impairment of non-financial assets, Note 4(a) - Critical accounting estimates and judgements - Company: Investments in subsidiaries and Note 18(a) - Investments in subsidiaries

As at 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the cost of investment in a subsidiary is RM25.1 billion.

The Group performed an impairment assessment of the cost of investment in a subsidiary during the financial year as there is an indicator of impairment of this subsidiary. The recoverable amount of the subsidiary was determined by the Directors based on VIU method. Based on the Directors’ assessment, the recoverable amount of the subsidiary exceeds the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and therefore no impairment is required.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

We performed the following audit procedures on the VIU calculations which were based on pre-tax cash flow projections based on internally approved financial budgets covering a five-year period:

- Discussed with management on the key assumptions used in the five-year VIU cash flows which include the compounded revenue and EBITDA annual growth rates and performed the following:
- - Agreed the five-year VIU cash flows to the financial budgets covering a five-year period from 2024 approved by the Directors for impairment assessment;
- Compared the historical forecast for 2023 to actual results to assess the reliability of management’s estimates;
- Compared the compounded revenue growth rates in the projection periods to historical results and telecommunications industry forecasts;

We focused on this area due to the estimation of the recoverable amounts which is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement on the future cash flows, terminal growth rates and discount rate applied.
- - Checked the mathematical accuracy of the five-year VIU cash flows.

Checked that the VIU cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount have been appropriately adjusted for the financing cash flows forecast of the subsidiary;
- Agreed the assumption on capital expenditures and operating expenditures to the financial budgets covering a five-year period from 2024 approved by the Directors, discussed with management on the capital expenditures and operating expenditures required to maintain the network performance, and assessed the impact on the VIU cash flows;
- Checked the reasonableness of the discount rate and terminal growth rate with the assistance of our valuation experts by benchmarking to industry reports;
- Checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management on the discount rate and terminal growth rate.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exception to the Directors’ assessment that the cost of investment in a subsidiary is not impaired as at 31 December 2023.

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report and Statement of Risk Management and Internal Control, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, and other sections of the 2023 Annual Report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. Other information does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s internal control.
3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.
4. Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# OTHER INFORMATION

# INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

In accordance with the MCCG, the Board, through the NRC, undertook relevant assessments and recommended for DHN to continue to serve as Independent Non-Executive Director for a further one (1) year period from 18 May 2024 to 17 May 2025.

DHN has abstained from deliberation and voting at the relevant NRC and Board meetings in respect of the recommendation on DHN’s continuation to act as an Independent Director of the Company.

The NRC and Board’s recommendations are based on the following justifications:

1. DHN has fulfilled the criteria of an Independent Director as stated in the MMLR. She has demonstrated her objectivity and independence both in substance and form. DHN is not hesitant to challenge the rest of the Board members and Management team in the course of discharging her responsibilities as a Director and when considering Board/Committee matters.
2. DHN is free from any conflicts of interest. She provides constructive independent counsel to the NRC (as Chair), ARC (as member) and Board, and guidance to Management. DHN has the ability to independently steer the NRC in the best interests of Maxis.
3. DHN has vast hands-on experience, knowledge and skills in a diverse range of businesses and therefore continually provides pragmatic opinions, counsel, oversight, and guidance as a Director. Her insights provide impartiality to matters considered by the Board and Board Committees.
4. DHN has specialised knowledge of human resources, people management and Corporate Social Responsibility practices which she brings to the Board and Maxis. DHN also has experience mentoring and coaching young talent and women.
5. The length of time that DHN has remained in her role has not interfered with her ability to exercise independent judgment as an Independent Director and she has continued to contribute to the performance and positive dynamics of the Board Committees and Board.
6. DHN together with the other Independent Directors, each function as a check and balance to the Board and in the exercise of objectivity as Directors.
7. DHN has devoted sufficient time and attention to her professional obligations to Maxis required for informed and balanced decision-making.

The Board continues to dedicate its efforts to searching the market for suitably qualified Independent Directors, including women directors who fulfil the required attributes and who can contribute to Maxis in its growth strategy. Board appointments are based on merits, skills, experience, gaps in Board composition and requirements of Maxis.

The NRC and Board are satisfied that DHN consistently demonstrates independent judgment and acts in the best interests of the Company.

DHN’s profile is set out on page 64 of the Company’s Integrated Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. DHN does not hold any shares in Maxis, has no family relationship with any Director and/or major shareholder of Maxis, has no conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest including any interest in any competing business with Maxis or its subsidiaries, has not been convicted of any offence within the past five (5) years and has not been imposed with any penalty by the relevant regulatory bodies during the financial year ended 2023.
