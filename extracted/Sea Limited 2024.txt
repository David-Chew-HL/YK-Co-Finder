• E-commerce and other services: GAAP revenue increased by 41.2% to US$3.4 billion in the 
third quarter of 2024 from US$2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by

volume grew.

quarter of 2024 from US$287.8 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help evaluate 
our operating performance: 
 
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss) 
plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) the net effect of changes in deferred 
revenue and its related cost for our digital entertainment segment. We believe that the segment 
adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their 
understanding of the past performance and future prospects. 
 
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our e -commerce segment, digital financial services segment and 
other services segment represents operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization 
expenses. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends 
in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future 
prospects. 
 
• “Total adjusted EBITDA” represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments 
combined, plus unallocated expenses. We believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to 
identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past 
performance and future prospects. 
 
These non -GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above 
financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net 
loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicato r of our operating 
performance. These non -GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to 
similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly 
titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness  as comparative measures to Sea’s data. We 
compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest 
U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our 
performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on 
any single financial measure.

(1) A combination of multiple business activities that do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable 
segments are grouped together as “Other Services”. 
(2) Unallocated expenses are mainly related to share -based compensation and general and corporate administrative 
costs such as professional fees and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to segments. These expenses are 
excluded from segment results as they are not reviewed by the CODM as part of segment performance.
