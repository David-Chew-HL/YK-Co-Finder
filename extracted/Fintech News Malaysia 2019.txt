FOREWORD
The Malaysian fintech ecosytem has grown considerably since we 
started Fintech News Malaysia 2 years ago and we are optimistic that it’s 
poised to grow even further.
The annual fintech report is our attempt at providing handy guide to 
anyone who’s interested to learn more about Malaysia’s fintech scene.
This year we’re fortunate enough to receive the support of generous sponsors like Touch ‘n Go eWallet, 
GHL, Jirnexu, pitchIN, MoneyMatch and DAX Ventures.
The sponsorship does not influence our editorial direction but it does enable us to spend more time to 
deep dive into our research. So if you enjoy this report, please show these lovely companies some 
support when the opportunity presents itself.
THE 2019  TOUCH ‘n GO eWallet Malaysian fintech report
is made possible thanks to  the support 
of our genereous sponsors below
THANK YOU!

FOREWORD
The traditional /f_inancial institutions have always prioritized to serve the 
/f_irst tier customers, preventing more than a billion Asians to be part of 
the main /f_inancial stream and accessing the most basic /f_inancial 
services such as savings account and credit lines. These /f_inancial 
institutions have a certain cost structure to keep up with, thus 
understandably impose higher /f_inancial fees – unaﬀordable to the 
many less aﬄuent. 
Thus, the emergence of Fintech makes it the most exciting 
development of today and will very well be the solution to broaden the 
/f_inancial inclusion. Although rather at a relatively nascent stage in 
Malaysia, Fintech has nonetheless gained some serious traction and 
penetrated signi/f_icantly into the /f_inancial ecosystem over the years. 
Fintech stands at an advantage with their appealing combo; low cost 
high tech /f_inancial services and strong grasp of consumer habits to tap 
into the unbanked segment. 
Financial institutions see this development as a possible threat to the existing formal /f_inancial ecosystem, 
thus their businesses. Despite that, regulators continue to push for Fintech to be an indispensable part of the 
ecosystem, in order to generate a competitive landscape. The regulatory sandboxes conceived for example, is 
aspired to catalyze innovative Fintech developments, involving all players of the industry. Platforms such as 
this should be bene/f_ited to create more of a symbiotic relationship rather than of a competitive one, between 
/f_inancial institutions and Fintech companies, to co-exist and complement each other. At the end of the day, 
inadvertently this reassuring development will no doubt bene/f_it consumers the most.
At GHL, we are ecstatic to be an essential part of this ecosystem, bringing to the table of our strongest value 
proposition - that our product oﬀerings cater for all, especially to the /f_inancially underserved. We aim to 
maneuver main problems faced by SMEs and the unbanked households – that is to bridge the payment and 
credit gap. While the urban population is thrilled to ride on this Fintech wave, we perceive that the bigger 
challenge lays in upgrading the /f_inancial literacy among the suburban and rural crowds. We embrace that 
challenge and poise to play an important role in changing that stigma.

RESPONDING TO FINTECH in 2019
HOW ARE BANKS
“We no longer view digitalization as initiatives; across retail and business banking as 
well as in human resource, talent and sustainability areas, raising our customers, 
employees and stakeholders’ digital engagement has simply become 
“business-as-usual” for the Bank. “
“RHB has always viewed the Fintech world as an opportunity to collaborate.  
As such, we have always worked closely with various fintechs ranging from P2P 
financing, aggregators, accounting solution providers and various others. “

“As we continuously embrace new technologies in today’s digitalised environment, it 
is crucial that banks and fintech players continuously find ways to collaborate in 
championing sustainable growth.”
“Clearly there is now going to be new competitors in town. It’s happening in Hong Kong, 
soon in Singapore and I’m sure Malaysia is next. I think these new players are not just 
new competitors in banking as we know it, but I do believe they will bring added 
capabilities to off-takers of financial services.”
“We can expect digitalisation will continue to be top on the agenda of the banking 
industry. Banks are expected to continue leverage on financial technology to 
reinvigorate financial services to create greater value for the stakeholders, and to 
promote a more inclusive financial system to reach allsegments of the community.”

NUMBER OF BANK BRANCHES
2008- 2018
Despite Malaysian’s increased level of comfort with mobile financial services, Malaysia’s top banks still has 
more bank branches today than they do 10 years ago. However, we are seeing signs of branch 
rationalisation with all the top banks with the exception of Public Bank.
Public Bank remains to be the only bank that has be actively adding to its branch network.

OUTWARDS & INWARDS 2018
The money services business segment within Malaysia is a very well-served space with non-banks significantly 
outpacing banks as the preferred method of sending money internationally. With the introduction of eKYC 
guidelines it is anticipated that there will be an increase in remittance using non-bank channels.
Though not as significant as some of its ASEAN neighbours, inward remittance still represents a sizeable 
contribution to Malaysia’s GDP .

E-WALLETRANKING BY MONTHL Y ACTIVE USERS
This chart is extracted from a study that was conducted by iPrice and AppAnnie.
While the study points to GrabPay as the leader in this space, it’s worth noting that the data includes 
users who may be using the app without necessarily using GrabPay as a payment option, which will 
likely skew the ranking in Grab‘s favour.
Boost had a headstart in the e-wallet race, securing a sizeable amount of customers with attractive 
cashback deals. While Touch n’ Go eWallet quickly rose through the ranks despite having a rocky start.
Fave though techically not an e-wallet, remains a popular option for Malaysians.
