B8 Status of corporate proposals
(i) Private placement of up to 30% of the issued ordinary shares in the Company
As announced on 29 January 2021, the Company proposed to undertake a private placement of up to 256,952,300 ordinary shares
in the Company (“Placement Shares”), representing approximately 30% of the total number of issued shares of the Company
(“Private Placement”). The Private Placement was completed on 14 January 2022. 
There were no acquisitions or disposals of quoted securities for the financial quarter under review.
These business ventures will be funded by the proceeds of a private placement exercise which was completed in January 2022.
When successfully implemented, these business ventures are expected to diversify the risk of the Group from being involved in one
single industry segment, have synergistic benefits to the Company through the sharing and consolidation of resources, and are also
expected to ultimately improve the financial performance of the enlarged group in the long run.
CUMULATIVE QUARTER
The above income tax provision arose from profit before tax generated by its wholly-owned subsidiary Boardroom.com Sdn Bhd and
Aldpro Corporate Services Sdn Bhd.
There were no acquisitions or disposals of unquoted investments and properties for the financial quarter under review.
INDIVIDUAL QUARTER
The plan comprises multiple corporate proposals that involve the Group undertaking fundraising, venturing into various new
businesses such as corporate and share registration services, development of mobile health technology services platform and
development of microcredit platform.
