---- Page 11 ----
This Form 20-F as filed with the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission for the year ended December 31, 2023 (this "Report") 
presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc (the 
"Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Shell") 
(pages 217-290). Except for these Financial Statements, the numbers 
presented throughout this Report may not sum precisely to the totals 
provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute 
figures due to rounding. Cross-references to Form 20-F are set out on 
pages 7-8 of this Report.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc and its subsidiaries 
contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with 
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements 
of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the "Act"), and therefore in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As applied to Shell, 
there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as defined 
above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations 
Committee. Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in accordance 
with IFRS. 
This Report contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such 
as cash capital expenditure. We are unable to provide a reconciliation 
of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable 
GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile 
those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial 
measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the 
control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange 
rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required 
precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely 
difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-
GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to 
the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner 
which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's 
consolidated financial statements. 
The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments 
are separate legal entities. In this report "Shell", "Shell Group" and "Group" 
are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell 
plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words "we", "us" and "our" 
are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those 
who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is 
served by identifying the particular entity or entities. "Subsidiaries", "Shell 
subsidiaries" and "Shell companies" as used in this report refer to entities 
over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term "joint 
venture", "joint operations", "joint arrangements", and "associates" may 
also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a 
direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term 
"Shell interest" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect 
ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint 
arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.
As used in this Report, "Accountable" is intended to mean: required or 
expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not 
necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually 
carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the 
implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. 
This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the 
framework is operating effectively. "Responsible" is intended to mean: 
required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell 
company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational 
performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, 
Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, 
and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the 
operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies 
and policies.
Shell's "net carbon intensity" referred to in this Report includes Shell's 
carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' 
carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production, and our 
customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy 
products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the 
term "Net Carbon Intensity" is for convenience only and not intended 
to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.
Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year 
period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic 
environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next 
ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets 
over the next 10 years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 
2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside 
our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero 
emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. 
However, if society is not net zero in 2050 as of today, there would 
be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. 
Except where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in 
respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling 
interest. However, the term "Shell share" is used for convenience to refer to 
the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold through 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary's production, 
processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are 
included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the 
subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-
share figures are limited only to Shell's entitlement. In all cases, royalty 
payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share. 
Except where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in 
US dollars. As used herein all references to "dollars" or "$" are to the 
US currency. 
This Report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of 
the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the 
financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All 
statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed 
to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are 
statements of future expectations that are based on management's current 
expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to 
differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. 
Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements 
concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements 
expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, 
projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are 
identified by their use of terms and phrases such as "aim", "ambition", 
"anticipate", "believe", "could", "estimate", "expect", "goals", "intend", 
"may", "milestones", "objectives", "outlook", "plan", "probably", "project", 
"risks", "schedule", "seek", "should", "target", "will" and similar terms and 
phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future 
operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from 
those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, 
including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural 
gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; 
(d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market 
share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) 
risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition 
properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such 
transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and 
countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal 
and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing 
climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various 
countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation 
and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, 
delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the 
reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of 
pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional 
conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cyber 
security breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. Also see "Risk 
factors" on pages 17-26 for additional risks and further discussion. No 
assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed 
previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in 
this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary

Who we are
12 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 14 ----
Our Powering Progress strategy is to generate more 
value for our shareholders, customers and wider society 
as we work to become a net-zero emissions energy 
business by 2050. Our purpose -- to provide more 
and cleaner energy solutions – drives our strategy. 
Our strategy is built upon: generating shareholder value, achieving net-
zero emissions, powering lives and respecting nature. At our Capital 
Markets Day in June 2023, we announced how we will put our 
strategy into action with a relentless focus on performance, discipline 
and simplification as we aim to deliver more value with less emissions. 
We are building on our strengths in Integrated Gas, Upstream and 
Marketing. We will invest around $40 billion in leading Integrated 
Gas and advantaged Upstream assets over 2023-2025. This will help 
drive significant and resilient cash delivery, while helping to provide 
energy security. Over the same period, investment in Downstream 
and Renewables and Energy Solutions will be around $35 billion, 
of which $10-15 billion will be in low-carbon energy solutions, 
as we help to enable the energy transition.
Achieving net zero
The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to
the threat of climate change by "holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels 
and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels". Shell supports the Paris Agreement goal to limit 
the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, urgent action is needed to reduce 
emissions across all sectors.
We are working to become a net-zero emissions energy business. 
This means net-zero carbon emissions from our operations. It also means 
net-zero carbon emissions from the energy products we sell (including 
those produced by others), which currently account for over 90% of 
the total emissions we report. We support a balanced energy transition 
where the world maintains a secure and affordable supply of energy, 
while building the clean energy system of the future. We want to play 
our part in the energy transition, purposefully and profitably.
We aim to partner with our customers, suppliers and governments to 
help decarbonise the energy system. Our integrated assets and supply 
chains are designed to provide a secure supply of energy for our 
customers, while also delivering low- and zero-carbon alternatives.

Generating 
shareholder 
value
We aim to generate more value for 
shareholders through disciplined capital 
allocation and a focus on performance.
We aim to generate more value for shareholders through disciplined 
capital allocation and a focus on delivering strong performance. 
We seek to provide enhanced distributions through our progressive 
dividend policy and share buyback programmes, which together 
target shareholder distributions* of 30-40% of cash flow from 
operations through the cycle. 
In 2023, total shareholder distributions* amounted to $23 billion, 
comprising $8 billion in cash dividends and $15 billion in share 
buybacks, and we generated $54 billion in cash flow from operating 
activities. This resulted in total shareholder distributions*of 42% of 
cash flow from operating activities*, around the upper end of our 
target range. Our capital expenditure was $23 billion and our cash 
capital expenditure* was $24 billion. We reduced our total debt to 
$82 billion and our net debt* to $44 billion as of December 31, 
2023.
We aim to grow our price-normalised free cash flow* by more than 
6% per year through 2030 and grow price-normalised free cash flow 
per share* by 10% per year through 2025. In 2023, we increased 
our dividend to $0.344 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023.
We are focusing on operational, financial and carbon performance, 
while maintaining our balance sheet strength. We take a disciplined 
approach to our portfolio and capital spending, aiming to invest 
where we have an enduring competitive advantage. 
In 2023, we announced capital expenditure targets of $22-25 billion 
per year in 2024 and 2025 and targeted structural cost reductions* 
of $2-3 billion by end-2025. By the end of 2023, we had made 
$1 billion in structural cost reductions*.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Achieving net-
zero emissions
We aim to become a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050 and will work 
with customers to help them decarbonise.
We have a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 
2050, purposefully and profitably. Our net-zero target covers 
emissions from our operations (Scope 1), emissions from the energy we 
buy to run our operations (Scope 2) and emissions from our customers' 
use of the energy products we sell (Scope 3). We have a target to 
halve Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets and activities 
under our operational control by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on 
a net basis. By the end of 2023 we had reduced our absolute 
emissions by 31% [A].
Our energy transition update includes an ambition to reduce customer 
emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, 
compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our net carbon 
intensity reduction targets are: 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 
15-20% by 2030, 100% by 2050 compared with a 2016 baseline.
We place a high priority on combatting methane emissions. Our target 
is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% for operated oil 
and gas assets (including liquefied natural gas) and to reach near-zero 
methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved this with methane 
emissions intensity at 0.05%. We have a target to end routine flaring 
from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the 
sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited 
(SPDC) [C].
We are transforming our business and selling more low-carbon 
products and services, and will work with our customers across 
sectors to accelerate the energy transition. We engage with 
governments and other stakeholders, including international 
organisations and industry associations, and participate in global 
events, such as COP28. Through this engagement we seek to support 
robust policies, legislation and regulations designed to generate the 
demand for investment in the low-carbon energy system.
[A] Reduced from 83 million tonnes of CO2e in 2016 to 57 million tonnes of CO2e in 2023.
[B] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 
517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
[C] In January 2024, Shell announced an agreement to sell SPDC. Completion of the 
transaction is subject to approvals by the Nigerian government and other conditions.

Powering
lives
We work to power lives through our 
products and activities, and by supporting 
an inclusive society.
We seek to make a positive impact on the lives of people around 
the world. We help to power lives and livelihoods by providing 
vital energy for homes, businesses, and transport. 
We support livelihoods by providing employment and training in 
the communities where we operate, and buying goods and services 
from local suppliers, contributing to a more inclusive economy. 
In 2023, we spent around $49 billion on goods and services 
from suppliers*around the world. Our activities generate revenues 
for governments through the taxes and royalties we pay, and 
the taxes we collect on their behalf. In 2023, taxes paid and 
collected* were $67 billion. This helps governments fund health 
care, education and other essential services.
Around 760 million people [A] in the world have no electricity and 
over half the world population has insufficient energy to lead a good 
life [B]. We deliver energy commercially, by investing in businesses 
that supply energy access in emerging markets; and socially, by 
investing funds, expertise and resources in access to 
energy programmes.
Shell aims to become one of the most diverse and inclusive 
organisations in the world. Our focus is on gender; race and ethnicity; 
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+); and disability. In 
2023, representation of women in senior leadership [C] grew to 32%. 
Our 2023 Shell People Survey showed a result of 83 points out of 100 
for all questions relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I). This 
suggests that overall our people feel ours is a workplace in which they 
belong, feel safe and respected, and have equal opportunities to 
progress and grow. We seek to respect human rights in all parts of our 
business. Since 2022, we have implemented practices to improve and 
maintain worker welfare for employees and contractors.

Respecting 
nature
We aim for a positive impact on 
biodiversity, zero waste and using water, 
other resources and materials efficiently. 
In 2023, we reviewed our progress and performance on respecting 
nature. We consolidated our respecting nature ambitions announced 
as part of our Powering Progress strategy in 2021 into the following 
themes: having a positive impact on biodiversity, aiming for zero 
waste and using water, other resources and materials efficiently.
We have already achieved some of the respecting nature 
commitments we set when we launched Powering Progress. Our 
commitment to reduce fresh-water consumption in highly water-
stressed areas by 15% was achieved ahead of the target date of 
2025. We have also conducted detailed assessments to inform our 
approach to fresh water and waste, which will be tailored to local 
conditions. We have concluded that our ambition to use 1 million 
tonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemical plants by 2025 
is unfeasible due to lack of available plastic waste feedstock, slow 
technology development and regulatory uncertainty.
The remaining commitments announced in 2021 have either been 
incorporated into our new Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management (SEAM) Standards, which take effect from mid-2024, 
or are included in the relevant business objectives and processes.
When planning new major projects, we conduct detailed 
environmental, social and health impact assessments. At the end of 
2023, 89% of major installations operated by Shell were certified 
against the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System, 
or were in compliance with equivalent environmental frameworks 
required by local regulations. We are pursuing certification for 
the remainder.
Air quality continues to be embedded in our environmental standards. 
We are developing a range of lower-emission choices for customers, 
from electric vehicle charge points to biofuels, to help people and 
companies use lower-emission modes of transport. We continue to 
explore how we can source responsibly in our supply chain. 
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329). Most comparable GAAP financial measure for Total spend 
of good and services is Capital expenditure of $23 billion in 2023. Most comparable GAAP 
financial measure for Taxes paid and collected is Taxes paid of $14 billion in 2023.

---- Page 17 ----
Delivering our strategy will require clear and deliberate capital 
allocation choices. We intend to focus on investing in businesses where 
we believe we have an enduring competitive advantage. The outlook 
for cash capital spending in 2024 and 2025 is in the $22-25 billion 
per year range. Additionally, we aim to reduce structural costs by 
$2-3 billion by the end of 2025, compared with 2022.
Our target for shareholder distributions is 30-40% of cash flow from 
operations through the cycle. We may return cash to shareholders 
through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We increased 
our dividend per share in 2023 and it is now 25% higher than the 
dividends for 2022. Subject to Board approval, we aim to grow the 
dividend per share by around 4% every year. When setting the level of 
shareholder distributions, the Board looks at a range of factors, including 
the macro environment, our underlying business earnings and cash flow, 
the current balance sheet, future investment, acquisition, and divestment 
plans and existing commitments.
In 2023, we renewed our focus on performance, discipline and 
simplification. We intend to demonstrate delivery of our targets, 
while strengthening the foundation of our lower-carbon businesses.
Recent times have been a stark reminder that energy security cannot 
be taken for granted. We support a balanced energy transition, where 
the world does not dismantle the current energy system faster than the 
clean energy system of the future can be built.
We are committed to our liquefied natural gas (LNG) business and 
growing it with some of the lowest emissions in our industry. We will 
increase capacity for our LNG portfolio by around 11 million tonnes per 
year in the second half of the decade – that is an annual increase of 
more than a quarter of our current capacity. LNG plays an important 
role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal and as a partner to wind 
and solar power for electricity generation. Our Upstream business aims 
to keep liquids production levels flat, while producing oil with lower 
emissions. We will be transforming our Downstream, Renewables 
and Energy Solutions business to offer more low-carbon solutions, 
while reducing sales of oil products. 
The statements in this "Outlook" section are forward-looking statements

The risks discussed below could have a 
material adverse effect separately, or in 
combination, on our earnings, cash flows 
and financial condition. Accordingly, 
investors should carefully consider 
these risks.
Further background on each risk is set out in the relevant sections of this 
Report, indicated by way of cross references.
The Board's responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing our 
significant and emerging risks is discussed in "Governance framework" 
on pages 149-154.
Strategic risks
We are exposed to macroeconomic risks, including fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and 
chemicals.
Risk description
The prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals can be volatile and are affected by supply and demand, both globally and regionally. Under high oil 
and gas prices, our entitlement to proved reserves under some production-sharing contracts has been, and could continue to be, reduced. Higher prices could also 
reduce demand for our products which could result in lower profitability in certain businesses in the Group, particularly in our Chemicals and Products, and Marketing 
businesses. Some of the reduction in demand could be permanent. Higher prices can also lead to more capacity being built, potentially resulting in an oversupplied 
market which would negatively affect our businesses. In the past, a high oil and gas price environment has generally led to sharp increases in costs and this could 
continue.
In addition, macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties have affected, and could continue to affect, production costs and demand for our products. 
Government actions may affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. These include price caps on gas, the promotion of electric vehicle sales 
or the phasing-out of future sales of new diesel or gasoline vehicles (as announced in the UK and due to come into force in 2035). Oil and gas prices can also move 
independently of each other (as seen with European gas prices in 2022). Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, 
weather, pandemics such as COVID-19, political instability, conflicts, such as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza, economic conditions, 
including inflation, and actions by major oil- and gas-producing countries. 
In a low oil and gas price environment, we have generated, and could continue to generate, less revenue from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and parts 
of those businesses could become less profitable or incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted and could continue to result in the debooking of proved oil 
or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of price environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted and could 
continue to result in projects being delayed or cancelled. Assets have been impaired in the past, and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices 
have affected, and could continue to affect, our ability to maintain our long-term capital investment and shareholder distribution programmes. Prolonged periods of 
low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas revenue. 
Accordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
See "Market overview" on page 36.
Our ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends in part on the accuracy of 
our price assumptions.
Risk description
We use a range of commodity price and margin assumptions, which we review on a periodic basis. These ranges help us to evaluate the robustness of our capital 
allocation for our evaluation of projects and commercial opportunities. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our 
earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Market overview" on page 37.
Our ability to achieve our strategic objectives depends on how we react to competitive forces. 
Risk description
We face competition in all our businesses. We seek to differentiate our services and products, though many of our products are competing in commodity-type markets. 
Accordingly, failure to manage our costs and our operational performance could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
We also compete with state-owned hydrocarbon entities and state-backed utility entities with access to financial resources and local markets. Such entities could be 
motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions. Accordingly, when bidding on new leases or projects, we could find ourselves at a 
competitive disadvantage because these state-owned entities may not require a competitive return. If we are unable to obtain competitive returns when bidding on 
new leases or projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

Strategic risks continued
Rising concerns about climate change and effects of the energy transition could lead to a fall in demand and 
potentially lower prices for fossil fuels. Climate change could also have a physical impact on our assets and supply 
chains. This risk has resulted in adverse litigation and regulatory developments which may recur in the future, resulting 
in project delays or cancellations, potential additional litigation, operational restrictions and additional compliance 
obligations.
Risk description
Societal demand for urgent action on climate change has increased, especially since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C effectively made the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C the 
default target. This increasing focus on climate change and drive for an energy transition have created a risk environment that is changing rapidly, resulting in a wide 
range of stakeholder actions at global, local and company levels. The potential impact and likelihood of the associated exposure for Shell could vary across different 
time horizons, depending on the specific components of the risk.
We expect that a growing share of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be subject to regulation, resulting in increased compliance costs and operational 
restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain oil and gas projects or make it more difficult to obtain required permits. Additionally, climate activists are challenging 
the grant of new and existing regulatory permits, and protesting at some of our facilities and projects. We expect that these challenges and protests are likely to 
continue and could delay or prohibit operations in certain cases. Our journey to achieving our target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business has resulted in 
and could continue to require additional costs. We also expect that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will lower demand and potentially affect prices for 
fossil fuels, as will increasing levels of GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This could be a factor contributing to additional 
provisions for our assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.
The pace and extent of the energy transition could pose a risk to Shell if we decarbonise our operations and the energy we sell at a different speed relative to society. 
If we are slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier, which would reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our reputation besides 
materially affecting our financial results. If we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, low-carbon products or markets for which or where 
demand fails to materialise. The operating margins for our low-carbon products and services have been, and could continue to be lower than the margins we have 
experienced historically in our oil and gas operations. Changes in climate-related regulations may also impact our returns. The physical effects of climate change such 
as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect our operations and supply chains. 
Certain investors have decided to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our 
securities and our ability to access capital markets. Stakeholder groups are also putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financing fossil fuel 
companies. Some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to fossil fuel projects. Accordingly, our ability to use financing for these types of future 
projects may be adversely affected. This could also adversely affect our partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt. 
In some countries governments, regulators, non-governmental organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for costs 
associated with climate change. Losing climate change lawsuits that have been filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and 
financial condition. For example, in May 2021, the District Court in The Hague, the Netherlands, ruled that by end 2030, Shell must reduce its aggregate net Scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions by 45%, compared with 2019 levels. The Scope 1 component is a results-based obligation and the Scope 2 and 3 components are a significant best-
efforts obligation.
As new technologies are developed to more accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction targets. Even if we 
meet our targets, our efforts may be characterised as insufficient.
In summary, rising climate change concerns, the pace at which we decarbonise our operations relative to society and effects of the energy transition pose multiple 
challenges to our business. These could, individually or collectively, result in, for example, financial penalties, additional provisions or payments of financial damages, 
and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Our journey to net zero" on pages 80-113, "Climate change and energy transition" on pages 231-243, "Renewables and energy solutions" on pages 73-76 and 
"Legal proceedings and other contingencies" on pages 286-288.

We operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This 
exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and 
regulations. We and our joint arrangements and associates also face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide. 
Risk description
Developments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our supply chains and operations. Potential impacts, which we have experienced in the past, include: 
forced divestment of assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights; delay of new projects; additional taxes, including 
windfall taxes (especially during periods of prolonged high oil and gas prices experienced in recent years, such as 2022), restrictions on deductions and retroactive 
tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price controls; local content requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental 
regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Many parts of the world are facing economic and fiscal 
challenges and growing pressure on cost-of-living standards. These issues impact our business as governments, in response to political and social pressures, pursue 
policies that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
The world is also facing continued geopolitical instability, including Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which impacts market conditions and our operations. The 
broader consequences of the conflict in Gaza remain uncertain and a wider regional escalation could have greater impacts on our operations in the Middle East and 
beyond. 
From time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non‑compliance 
with policies and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's 
opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; failing to honour existing 
contractual commitments; and seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Certain governments have also adopted laws and regulations that could 
potentially conflict with other countries' laws and regulations, potentially subjecting us to criminal and civil sanctions. Such developments and outcomes could have a 
material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
See "Governance framework" on page 152.
An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new 
hydrocarbon or low-carbon opportunities or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate. 
Risk description
Our reputation is an important asset. The Shell General Business Principles (SGBP) govern how Shell and its individual companies conduct their affairs, and the Shell 
Code of Conduct tells employees and contract staff how to behave in line with the SGBP. Our challenge is to ensure that all employees and contract staff comply with 
the Principles and the Code of Conduct. Real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance or a perceived lack of understanding of how our 
operations affect surrounding communities could harm our reputation.
Societal expectations of companies are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and minimising damage to the 
environment. There is increasing focus on the role of oil and gas in the context of climate change and the energy transition. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 
continue to challenge Shell's social and legal licence to operate through activities to block or delay projects and by bringing legal actions, diverting our resources. In 
key markets, we are seeing an increasing number of protests at external events such as the Annual General Meeting, claims brought by NGOs and our brand 
communications have been subject to bans from advertising regulators in the UK and the Netherlands, following complaints received from members of the public. 
During prolonged periods of high oil and gas prices, the oil and gas industry could be accused of profiteering from higher fuel and electricity prices and therefore 
impacting living costs. This could negatively affect our brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could limit our ability to deliver our strategy, reduce consumer 
demand for our branded and non-branded products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and restrict our ability to access capital markets or 
attract staff. Many other factors, including the materialisation of other risks discussed in this section, could negatively affect our reputation and could have a material 
adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Living by our values" on page 135.
 
Operational risks
Some of the consequences of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine remain unpredictable. The evolving geopolitical 
situation, including sanctions and export controls, has caused challenges to our operations, the security of our 
people, and has created new reputational exposure, both of which are likely to continue in the medium to longer 
term. 
Risk description
The Russia-Ukraine war continues to pose challenges to our operations and commercial decisions. The subsequent sanctions and export controls imposed by countries 
around the world are continuing to have a material impact on a number of our activities, including supply, trading and treasury activities. More sanctions and export 
controls could be expected. 
This continuing war could give rise to additional events that could materially impact our operations, which may be temporary or more permanent in nature. These risks 
and future events could impact the security of our people, our supply chain, commodity prices, credit, commodity trading, treasury and legal activities. In addition, 
there are potential reputational risks associated with how Shell's decisions in response to evolving challenges are perceived. The tensions also create heightened 
cyber security threats to our information technology (IT) infrastructure. 
Any of these factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements based on available information and 
the application of complex rules. This means subsequent downward adjustments are possible.
Risk description
The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic 
information. Estimates can change over time because of new information from production or drilling activities, changes in economic factors, such as oil and gas prices, 
alterations in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. Estimates also change to reflect acquisitions, divestments, new discoveries, extensions of 
existing fields and mines, and improved recovery techniques. Published proved oil and gas reserves estimates could also be subject to correction because of errors in 
the application of rules and changes in guidance. Downward adjustments could indicate lower future production volumes and could also lead to impairment of assets. 
This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited)" on pages 291-309.
Our future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery of large and integrated projects and our ability to 
replace proved oil and gas reserves.
Risk description
We face numerous challenges in developing capital projects, especially those which are large and integrated. Challenges include: uncertain geology; frontier 
conditions; the existence and availability of necessary technology and engineering resources; the availability of skilled labour; the existence of transport infrastructure; 
project delays; the expiration of licences; delays in obtaining required permits; potential cost overruns; and technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. 
These challenges are particularly relevant in certain developing and emerging market countries, in frontier areas and in deep-water fields, such as off the coast of 
Namibia. We may fail to assess or manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles could impair our delivery of these projects, our ability to fulfil the 
full potential value of the project as assessed when the investment was approved, and our ability to fulfil related contractual commitments. This could lead to 
impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
Future oil and gas production will depend on our access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other owners of proved 
reserves and acquisitions, and through developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields. Failure to replace proved reserves could 
result in an accelerated decrease of future production, potentially having a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which we work, to a wide range of health, safety, 
security and environment risks.
Risk description
The health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) risks to which we and the communities in which we work are potentially exposed cover a wide spectrum, given the 
geographical range, operational diversity and technical complexity of our operations. These risks include the effects of natural disasters (including weather events and 
earthquakes), social unrest, pandemic diseases, criminal actions by external parties, and safety lapses. If a major risk materialises, such as an explosion or 
hydrocarbon leak or spill, which we have experienced in the past, this could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm, disruption of business activities, loss or 
suspension of permits, loss of our licence to operate and loss of our ability to bid on mineral rights. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our 
earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
Our operations are subject to extensive HSSE regulatory requirements that often change and are likely to become more stringent over time. Governments could 
require operators to adjust their future production plans, affecting production and costs. We could incur significant extra costs in the future because of the need to 
comply with such requirements. We could also incur significant extra costs due to violations of or liabilities under laws and regulations that involve elements such as 
fines, penalties, clean-up costs and third-party claims. If HSSE risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial 
condition. 
See "Safety" on pages 131-134 and "Living by our values" on pages 137.
A further erosion of the business and operating environment in Nigeria could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Risk description
In our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse conditions. These include: security incidents affecting the safety of our people, host communities and 
operations; sabotage and crude theft; ongoing litigation; limited infrastructure; challenges presented by delayed government and partner funding and budget delays; 
and regional instability created by militant activities. Some of these risks and adverse conditions, such as security issues affecting the safety of our people and 
sabotage and theft, have occurred in the past and are likely to continue in the future, with a potential material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial 
condition.

Operational risks continued
We rely heavily on information technology systems in our operations. 
Risk description
Our continued focus on digitalising our business processes, and our increasing dependence on information technology (IT) systems for our core operations, mean that 
we are heavily reliant on secure, affordable and resilient IT services provided both in-house and by third parties.
Externally, we observe several developments impacting our IT and cyber risk profile: deterioration of the cyber security threat landscape represented by increasing 
volumes of attacks by sophisticated cyber actors, technology developments (such as artificial intelligence), geopolitical conflicts and increases in regulations across 
the markets in which Shell operates. We have observed an increase in social engineering (manipulation of individuals) as a method of financially driven cyber crime. 
Threat actors are targeting bank account changes, invoice settlement and identity fraud to extract money from corporations. Ransomware attacks on corporations 
continue to be widespread. These contribute to potential breaches and disruptions of critical IT services, such as the security incident involving the transfer of files 
which Shell experienced in 2023. If breaches are not detected early and responded to effectively, they could impact our operations and the safety of our staff and/or 
harm our reputation and/or result in material regulatory fines. This could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
See "Other central activities" on page 79. 
Our business exposes us to risks of social instability, criminality, civil unrest, terrorism, piracy, cyber disruption and 
acts of war that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Risk description
As seen in recent years, these risks can manifest themselves in the countries where we operate and elsewhere. These risks impact people, our operations and assets. 
Risks which have materialised in the past include: acts of terrorism; acts of criminality, including maritime piracy, sabotage and tapping into our pipelines in Nigeria; 
cyber espionage or disruptive cyber attacks; conflicts, including war - such as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine; civil unrest such as the 2023 political unrest in 
Pakistan; malicious acts carried out by individuals within Shell, such as data exfiltration during divestments; and environmental and climate activism (including 
disruptions by non-governmental organisations) especially in the USA and north-west Europe, where, for example, activists boarded and protested during the sailing 
of the Penguins floating production and storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to Norway.
The above risks can threaten the safe operation of our assets and the transport of our products. They can harm the well-being of our people, inflict loss of life and 
injuries, and disrupt our operational activities. They can also damage the environment and negatively impact our reputation. These risks could have a material adverse 
effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Safety" on page 134.
The Groningen region in the Netherlands continues to experience earthquakes induced by historical gas production 
activities, affecting local communities.
Risk description
Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM). An important part of NAM's gas production comes from the 
onshore Groningen gas field, in which EBN, a Dutch government entity, has a 40% interest and NAM a 60% interest. The Dutch government issues annual gas 
production instructions for the Groningen field. As per the latest instruction, production ceased on October 1, 2023. However, the Dutch government has indicated to 
NAM it could decree a restart of minimal production in exceptional circumstances during the current gas year, which occurred on January 8-10, 2024, for a cold spell 
of several days. 
The region is still experiencing earthquakes induced by historical gas production. This has resulted in damaged buildings in the region, which has led to complaints 
and lawsuits from the local community and promises of compensation from the Dutch government to the region. The Dutch State has taken over the handling of 
damage claims from NAM for all claim categories, as well as activities to strengthen buildings in the region, while NAM remains financially responsible insofar as the 
costs correspond to NAM's liability. While we expect the cessation of production from the Groningen gas field on October 1, 2023, to further reduce seismicity, any 
additional earthquakes, or the government passing on costs to NAM beyond NAM's liability, could have further material adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows 
and financial condition.

Operational risks continued
We are exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and 
credit risk. We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment and the conditions of financial and 
commodity markets. 
Risk description
Our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world. Political or economic 
instability affects such markets.
We use debt instruments, such as bonds and commercial paper, to raise significant amounts of capital. Should access to debt markets become more challenging, the 
impact on our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to fossil fuel 
projects. Group financing costs could also be affected by interest rate fluctuations or any credit rating deterioration.
We are exposed to changes in currency values and to exchange controls as a result of our substantial international operations. Our reporting currency is the US 
dollar, although, to a material extent, we also hold assets and are exposed to liabilities in other currencies. While we undertake some foreign exchange hedging, 
we do not do so for all our activities. Even where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected.
Commodity trading is an important component of our businesses. Processing, managing and monitoring many trading transactions across the world, some of which 
are complex and, depending on the terms of our commodity contracts, exposes us to operational and market risks, including commodity price risks. We use derivative 
instruments such as futures, options and contracts for difference to hedge market risks. Due to differences between derivative instruments available in the market to 
hedge market risks and the actual market risks we are exposed to, perfect hedging is not always achievable. Therefore, our hedging has from time to time not 
functioned as expected and may not function as expected in the future. We undertake commodity trading to optimise commercial margins or to profit from expected 
market price movements. Even with sound risk management procedures and controls in place, this activity involves forecasting and hence we are exposed to the risk of 
incurring significant losses if prices develop contrary to management expectations. 
We are exposed to credit risk; our counterparties could fail or be unable to meet their payment and/or performance obligations under contractual arrangements.
Our pension plans invest in government bonds, so they could be affected by a sovereign debt downgrade or other default.
If any of the above risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Financial framework" on page 32.
Our future performance depends on the successful development and deployment of new technologies that provide 
new products and solutions.
Risk description
Technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to help meet the world's energy demands competitively. If we fail to effectively develop or deploy new 
technology, products and solutions, or fail to make full, effective use of our data in a timely and cost-effective manner, there could be a material adverse effect on the 
delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate. We operate in environments where advanced technologies are used. In developing new technologies, products 
and solutions, unknown or unforeseeable technological failures or environmental and health effects could harm our reputation and licence to operate or expose us to 
litigation or sanctions. The associated costs of new technology are sometimes underestimated. Sometimes the development of new technology is subject to delays. If 
we are unable to develop the right technology and products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we develop technologies, products and solutions that harm the 
environment or people's health, there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Other central activities" on page 79.
We have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks and other factors.
Risk description
Liabilities associated with defined benefit pension plans are significant, and the cash funding requirement of such plans can also involve significant liabilities. They both 
depend on various financial and demographic assumptions. Volatility in capital markets or government policies could affect investment performance, inflation and 
interest rates, causing significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities and/or short-term liquidity requirements. Changes in assumptions for mortality, 
retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement could also cause significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. We operate a number of 
defined benefit pension plans and, in case of a shortfall, we could be required to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations). 
This could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Financial framework" on page 32.
We mainly self-insure our hazard risk exposures. Consequently, we could incur significant financial losses from 
different types of risks that are not insured with third-party insurers. 
Risk description
Our Group insurance companies (wholly owned subsidiaries) provide insurance coverage to Shell subsidiaries and entities in which Shell has an interest. These 
subsidiaries and entities may also insure a portion of their risk exposures with third parties, but such external insurance would not provide any material coverage in the 
event of a large-scale safety or environmental incident. Accordingly, in the event of a material incident, we would have to meet our obligations without access to 
material proceeds from third-party insurers. We have in the past incurred adverse impacts from events, such as Hurricane Ida in 2021. We may, in the future, incur 
significant losses from different types of hazard risks that are not insured with third-party insurers, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our earnings, 
cash flows and financial condition.

Operational risks continued
Many of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or with associates. This could 
reduce our degree of control and our ability to identify and manage risks. 
Risk description
When we are not the operator, we have less influence and control over the behaviour, performance and operating costs of joint arrangements or associates. Despite 
having less control, we could still be exposed to the risks associated with these operations, including reputational, litigation (where joint and several liability could 
apply) and government sanction risks. For example, our partners or members of a joint arrangement or an associate, (particularly local partners in developing 
countries), may be unable to meet their financial or other obligations to projects, threatening the viability of a given project. Where we are the operator of a joint 
arrangement, the other partner(s) could still be able to veto or block certain decisions, which could be to our overall detriment. Accordingly, where we have limited 
influence, we are exposed to operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
See "Governance framework"on page 152.
 
Conduct and culture risks
We are exposed to regulatory and conduct risk in our trading operations.
Risk description
Commodity trading is an important component of our business. Our commodity trading entities are subject to many regulations, including requirements for standards 
of conduct. The risk of ineffective controls, poor oversight of trading activities, and the risk that traders could deliberately operate outside compliance limits and 
controls, either individually or as a group, has occurred. This has resulted in losses in the past and may result in further losses in the future. The rapidly changing 
regulatory environment creates a risk of insufficient, delayed or incorrect implementation of new or changes to existing regulatory requirements. Violations of such 
regulatory requirements could also expose us and/or our employees to regulatory fines and have an adverse effect on our licence to operate. These risks could harm 
our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
See "Living by our values" on page 136.
Violations of antitrust and competition laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions 
and civil suits.
Risk description
Antitrust and competition laws apply to Shell and its joint arrangements and associates in the vast majority of countries where we do business. Shell and its joint 
arrangements and associates have been fined for violations of antitrust and competition laws in the past. This includes a number of fines by the European Commission 
Directorate-General for Competition (DG COMP). Because of DG COMP's fining guidelines, any future conviction of Shell or any of its joint arrangements or 
associates for violation of EU competition law could potentially result in significantly larger fines and have a material adverse effect on us. Violation of antitrust laws is 
a criminal offence in many countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. In certain circumstances, directors may receive director disqualification orders. It is 
also now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by antitrust violations to sue for damages. Any violation of these laws can harm our reputation and 
could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Living by our values" on page 136.
Violations of anti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws carry fines and expose us and/or our 
employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.
Risk description
Anti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws apply to Shell, its joint arrangements and associates in all countries where we do business. Shell and its joint 
arrangements and associates have in the past settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
Any violation of anti-bribery, tax-evasion or anti-money laundering laws, including potential violations associated with Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production 
Company Limited's investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block, could harm our reputation or have a 
material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of such laws also could expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions, 
civil suits and other consequences, such as debarment and the revocation of licences.

Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil 
suits.
Risk description
Data privacy and the management of personal data have become an issue of increasing importance and focus for companies and regulators in recent years. 
Following the implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, we have on a global basis seen updates to, or the introduction of, 
data privacy laws largely based on the GDPR. More than 100 countries globally now have data privacy laws. Shell companies are increasingly processing large 
volumes of personal data as we continue to acquire small companies with relatively large amounts of customer data. In doing so, we must consider how we manage 
personal data effectively and responsibly, including managing the associated cyber risks. In some countries that are key to Shell's business operations, such as China, 
relevant legislation continues to be amended or introduced. Shell must be able to adapt dynamically to such legislative changes and be capable of updating our 
internal programmes if necessary. Many countries require mandatory notification of data breaches often within short time frames (72 hours) in certain situations. In 
these circumstances we might be required to report to affected individuals and regulators in the relevant countries. Non-compliance with data protection laws could 
harm individuals and expose us to regulatory investigations. This could result in fines, which could be up to 4% of global annual turnover if under the GDPR; orders to 
stop processing certain data; harm to our reputation; and loss of the trust of existing and potential customers, stakeholders, governments, and employees. With regard 
to data breaches in the past, we notified a number of data privacy regulators of personal data breaches and have had fines issued against us and this could happen 
in the future. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also 
be subject to litigation from persons or entities allegedly affected by data protection violations.
Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws could harm our 
reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Living by our values" on page 135. 
Violations of trade compliance laws and regulations, including sanctions, carry fines and expose us and our 
employees to criminal proceedings and civil suits.
Risk description
We use "trade compliance" as an umbrella term for various national and international laws designed to regulate the movement of items across national boundaries 
and restrict or prohibit trade, financial flows and other dealings with certain parties, countries and territories. For example, the EU, the UK and the USA continue to 
impose comprehensive sanctions on countries and territories such as Syria, North Korea, and Crimea and other territories in Eastern Ukraine. The USA continues to 
have comprehensive sanctions against Iran and Cuba. The EU, the UK and some other nations such as Canada and Australia continue to maintain targeted sanctions 
against Iran. The EU and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, which the USA expanded in 2018 and 2019 and relaxed temporarily in 
2023. 
Since 2014, the EU and the USA have imposed and increased restrictions and controls directed at defined oil and gas activities in Russia, as well as restricting access 
to EU and USA financing sources for certain Russian state-owned entities and military and dual-use controls. In February 2022, countries around the world began 
imposing additional sanctions and trade controls against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including regional trade bans, designations of entities (including 
Russian banks and state-owned entities) and individuals as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Parties, and restrictions on access by Russia to financial 
systems. In addition, the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia have introduced restrictions on the import of Russian-origin LNG. These restrictions are subject to 
different wind-down periods and limited exceptions. Furthermore, it is likely that sanctions against Russia will continue to escalate. Russia has in turn adopted a 
significant number of countermeasures, including making it an offence to take steps to comply with foreign sanctions.
Many other nations have adopted or expanded trade compliance programmes similar to those administered by the EU, the UK and the USA. Intergovernmental 
cooperation in this area has increased and there is growing pressure to enforce existing sanctions globally.
Abiding by all the laws and regulations on trade compliance is often complex and challenging because of factors such as: the expansion of sanctions; the frequent 
addition of prohibited parties as well as other measures; the number of markets in which we operate; the risk of differences in how jurisdictions apply sanctions; and 
the large number of transactions we process. Shell has voluntarily self-disclosed potential violations of sanctions in the past.
Any violation of sanctions could lead to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on or prosecution of Shell or its employees. This could harm our 
reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Living by our values" on page 136.
The successful delivery of our strategy is dependent on our people and on a culture that aligns to our goals and 
reflects the changes we need to make as part of the energy transition. 
Risk description
Shell's culture is defined as the shared values, practices and beliefs of its employees. It is influenced by decisions on organisation structure and accountabilities, 
people and skills, how work is done using processes and systems and what mindset and behaviours exist. All these elements need to act in harmony to create our 
desired culture and ensure successful and sustained performance in line with our strategy.
As the energy system transforms and we reshape our portfolio, elements of our culture will need to change. For example, we will have to develop new skills, and 
adapt processes and systems, which, in some areas, will need to be different from those required for our traditional oil and gas businesses. We will have to continually 
leverage our learner mindset to anticipate and respond to the faster pace of change in the external market. However, we also will need to retain our shared values of 
"honesty, integrity and respect for people" to ensure trust and openness in how we do business, and to ensure staff feel valued and perform at their best.
If we fail to maintain a culture that aligns to our strategy, this could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial 
condition.

Performance indicators
Progress to date on the financial targets that were announced during 
Capital Markets Day in June 2023 is available at shell.com/investors/

These indicators enable management to evaluate Shell's performance 
against our annual operating plan. They are also used as part of the 
determination of Executive Directors' remuneration. See "Directors' 
Remuneration Report" on pages 174-176.
Safety remains our top priority. Sadly, five contractor colleagues 
died in incidents that took place at Shell operations in 2023. 
This is a reminder of our need to relentlessly focus on safety.
In 2023, we exceeded our targets for Financial delivery, Shell's journey 
in the energy transition and Operational excellence..
We had another year of very strong financial delivery with the 
second-highest cash flow from operations in Shell's history, despite 
the external uncertainty and volatility.
In Shell's journey in the energy transition we made good 
progress on increasing the number of electric vehicle charge points 
and reducing operational emissions. The contribution of low-carbon 
products in the Adjusted Earnings of the Marketing segment decreased 
mainly due to lower lubricants demand and higher costs for low-carbon 
Mobility products. 
Operational excellence ensures we deliver for our customers and 
drive financial performance. We had good Project delivery outcomes 
in 2023 and the Customer excellence indicators were very positive. 
Upstream controllable availability was outstanding but midstream 
was impacted by unplanned maintenance. Chemicals and Refining 
availability was impacted by ongoing challenges at Shell Polymers 
Monaca, and the recovery after a fire in Deer Park.

 Operational excellence
Project delivery 
on schedule (%)
Project delivery on schedule reflects our capability to complete major projects on 
time and within budget. Project delivery on schedule measures the percentage 
of projects delivered on schedule.
Project delivery 
on budget (%)
Project delivery on budget reflects the aggregate cost against the aggregate 
baseline for those projects, where a figure greater than 100% means over budget. 
Customer 
satisfaction (index)
The customer satisfaction index (CSI) is the quantitative measurement of customer 
experience (CX) performance. It is provided from the global transactional survey 
programme (both email and digital surveys). CSI is calculated using simple 
average methodology from individual customer responses/satisfaction scores 
(overall satisfaction with Shell) covering all businesses and countries.
Brand Share 
Preference (%)
Brand Share Preference is the percentage of customers who answer "Shell" 
in response to the question: "Assuming that all the fuel station companies that 
you would consider are conveniently located, which one company do you prefer 
most?". Responses are taken from survey respondents in more than 60 countries 
covering both fuel and non-fuel retail consumers.
Upstream controllable 
availability (%)
Upstream controllable availability performance reflects our ability to optimally 
run our Upstream assets. Reliability issues, turnarounds and maintenance at own-
operated or third-party facilities all impact controllable availability, but it excludes 
the impact of extreme unexpected events that are outside our control, such as 
government restrictions and hurricanes. Upstream controllable availability includes 
all Shell-operated assets (excluding Groningen) and selected assets not operated 
by Shell, but for which Shell has strategic influence. 
Midstream 
availability (%)
Midstream availability shows to what extent LNG assets are ready to process 
product as a comparison with capacity, considering the impact of planned 
and unplanned maintenance.
Refinery and chemical 
plant availability (%)
Refinery and chemical plant availability is the weighted average of the 
actual uptime of plants as a percentage of their maximum possible uptime. 
The weighting is based on the capital employed, adjusted for cash and non-
current liabilities. This indicator is a measure of the operational excellence 
of our refinery and chemical plant facilities.
See "Chemicals and Products" on page 67.
 Safety
Personal safety
(SIF-F cases per 100 
million working hours)
Serious Injury, Illness and Fatality (SIF) is defined as a serious work-related injury 
or illness that resulted in a fatality or a life-altering event, which is defined as 
a long-term or permanent injury or illness with a significant impact on daily 
activities. Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) is calculated by dividing 
the number of employee and contractor SIF by 100 million working hours.
See "Safety" on page 134. 
[A] 2022 adjustment on SIF-F from 1.7 to 2.0 due to a change in classification for one injury 
after publication.
Process safety 
(number of events)
A Tier 1 process safety event is an unplanned or uncontrolled release of any 
material, including non-toxic and non-flammable materials, from a process with 
the greatest actual consequence resulting in harm to employees, contract staff, 
or a neighbouring community, damage to equipment, or exceeding a threshold 
quantity, as defined by the API Recommended Practice 754 and IOGP Standard 
456. A Tier 2 process safety event is a release of lesser consequence.

Earnings 2023-2022
Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders in 2023 was $19,359 
million, compared with $42,309 million in 2022. With non-controlling 
interest included, income for the period in 2023 was $19,636 million, 
compared with $42,874 million in 2022. After current cost of supplies 
adjustment, total segment earnings in 2023 were $20,281 million, 
compared with $41,562 million in 2022.
Adjusted Earnings* in 2023 were $28,250 million, compared with 
$39,870 million 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by lower 
realised oil and gas prices, lower volumes and lower refining margins, 
partly offset by higher LNG trading and optimisation margins, and 
higher Marketing margins.
2023 income attributable to Shell plc shareholders also included net 
impairment charges and reversals of $6,219 million, and unfavourable 
movements of $1,284 million due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives. These charges and unfavourable movements 
are included in identified items amounting to a net loss of $8,252 million.
Integrated Gas earnings in 2023 were $7,046 million, compared 
with $22,212 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly driven 
by unfavourable movements due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives, net impairment charges and reversals,
the net effect of lower realised prices, and higher contributions from 
trading and optimisation, unfavourable deferred tax movements, 
and lower volumes.
See "Integrated Gas" on page 39.
Upstream earnings in 2023 were $8,528 million, compared with 
$16,222 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by lower 
realised oil and gas prices, lower volumes, and net impairment charges 
and reversals.
See "Upstream" on page 45.
Marketing earnings  in 2023 were $2,950 million, compared with 
$2,133 million in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by higher 
Marketing margins, including higher unit margins in Mobility, higher 
margins in Lubricants due to lower feedstock costs, and higher volumes 
in Sectors and Decarbonisation. These were partly offset by higher 
operating expenses and depreciation charges, mainly as a result of 
asset acquisitions.

Chemicals and Products earnings  in 2023 were $1,530 million, 
compared with $4,515 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly 
driven by net impairment charges and reversals, and lower Products 
margins, which were mainly driven by lower refining margins and partly 
offset by higher margins from trading and optimisation. Segment 
earnings also reflected higher depreciation charges, due to start-up 
of operations at Shell Polymers Monaca in the USA, partly offset 
by higher Chemicals margins.
See "Chemicals and Products" on page 66.
Renewables and Energy Solutions earnings  in 2023 were $3,038 
million, compared with a loss of $1,059 million in 2022. The increase 
was mainly driven by favourable movements due to the fair value 
accounting of commodity derivatives. This was partly offset by lower 
margins, mainly from trading and optimisation due to lower gas 
and power prices in 2023, net impairment charges and reversals, 
unfavourable tax movements and higher operating expenses.
See "Renewables and Energy Solutions" on page 73.
Corporate segment earnings  in 2023 were an expense of 
$2,811 million, compared with an expense of $2,461 million in 2022. 
The rise in expense was mainly driven by unfavourable movements 
in currency exchange rate effects and tax credits.
See "Corporate" on page 77.
Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 29) and 
Form 20-F (page 33) for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales 
and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was $54,191 million in 2023, 
compared with $68,414 million in 2022. The cash flow from operating 
activities in 2023 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and 
working capital inflow of $7.8 billion, partly offset by tax payments 
of $13.7 billion, and derivatives outflow of $6.1 billion.
Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure* was $24,392 million in 2023, compared
with $24,833 million in 2022. The cash capital expenditure in 2023 
consisted of $12.5 billion investments in oil, oil products and other, 
$5.6 billion investments in low-carbon energy solutions, $4.0 billion 
investments in LNG gas and power marketing and trading and 
$2.3 billion investments in non-energy products. 
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 93.
Operating expenses and Underlying operating expenses
Operating expenses* were $39,960 million in 2023, compared 
with $39,476 million in 2022. Underlying operating expenses* 
were $39,201 million, compared with $39,456 million in 2022.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Return on average capital employed
Our return on average capital employed (ROACE)* decreased to 8.4%, 
compared with 16.7% in 2022, mainly driven by lower earnings.

Financial framework 
We manage our businesses to deliver strong cash flows, sustain our 
strategy and create profitable growth. Management applies Shell's 
cash to support disciplined capital expenditure and maintain a resilient 
balance sheet; target AA credit metrics through the cycle; deliver 
a progressive dividend to shareholders with growth of around 4% 
annually (subject to Board approval); and target total distributions 
to shareholders of 30-40% of our cash flow from operating activities 
through the cycle.
The Board may choose to return cash to shareholders through a 
combination of dividends and share buybacks. When setting the level 
of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at a range of factors, 
including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and 
cash flows of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, 
acquisition and divestment plans, and existing commitments.
Liquidity and capital resources
Shell generated free cash flow* of $36.5 billion in 2023, aided 
by disciplined capital management, portfolio simplification and 
operational performance improvements. Net debt* decreased to 
$43.5 billion at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: $44.8 
billion). Total debt reduced to 81.5 billion at December 31, 2023 
(December 31, 2022: 83.8 billion), Gearing* decreased to 18.8% at 
December 31, 2023, compared with 18.9% at December 31, 2022. 
See Note 20 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 262-263.
Liquidity
We satisfy our funding, liquidity and working capital requirements by 
using cash generated from our operations, the issuance of debt and 
through divestments. In 2023, access to the international debt capital 
markets remained strong, with our debt principally financed from 
these markets through central debt programmes consisting of: 
￮ a $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, with 
maturities between 183 days and 364 days;
￮ a $10 billion US CP programme, with maturities not exceeding 
397 days;
￮ an unlimited Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme (also 
referred to as the Multi-Currency Debt Securities Programme); and
￮ an unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration. 
The CP, EMTN and US shelf debt is issued by Shell International 
Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, with its debt being 
guaranteed by Shell plc. In the future, Shell will also be able to issue 
debt through a new US subsidiary, Shell Finance US Inc., with 
its debt also being guaranteed by Shell plc.
We also maintain committed credit facilities. Of the $9.92 billion total 
facility, $1.92 billion matures in 2024 (with a one-year bank extension 
option, taking final maturity to 2025) and $8.0 billion in 2026. This 
remained fully undrawn at December 31, 2023. These core facilities 
and cash on balance sheet provide back-up coverage for our CP 
programmes. Other than certain borrowings by subsidiaries in their 
local jurisdictions, we do not have any other committed credit facilities. 
Our total debt decreased by $2.3 billion to $81.5 billion at December 
31, 2023. The total debt excluding lease liabilities matures as follows: 
10% in 2024; 12% in 2025; 7% in 2026; and 71% in 2027 and 
beyond. The portion of debt maturing in 2024 is expected to be 
repaid from some combination of cash balances, cash generated from 
operations, divestments and the issuance of new debt. In 2023, we did 
not issue any bonds under our US shelf registration, EMTN programme 
or CP programmes. The Group had no CP outstanding at December 31, 
2023. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding 
sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing 
facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.
While our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign 
withholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash dividends, 
loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to have a 
material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations. 
Market risk and credit risk
We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment, as well as 
financial and commodity market conditions. This exposes us to treasury 
and trading risks, including liquidity risk, credit risk, and market risk 
(interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk). 
The size and scope of our businesses require a robust financial control 
framework and effective management of our various risk exposures.
See "Risk factors" on page 23 and Note 25 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
on pages 276-282.
We use various financial instruments for managing exposure to 
commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. 
Our treasury and trading operations are highly centralised and seek 
to manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, 
commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. Our portfolio 
of cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any 
one instrument, country or counterparty. The use of external derivative 
instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury 
organisations that have robust control and reporting systems, and 
employees with appropriate skills, experience and supervision. Credit 
risk policies are in place to ensure that sales of products are made 
to customers with appropriate creditworthiness, and include credit 
analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit 
limits. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, 
prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk.
In effecting commodity trades and derivative contracts, we operate 
according to internal procedures and policies designed to ensure that 
market risks are managed within authorised limits and trading can only 
be performed by staff with the appropriate skills and experience. We 
closely monitor developments in sanctions and export controls to ensure 
compliance with applicable laws and regulatory guidance. Management 
regularly reviews mandated trading limits. A department that is 
independent from our traders monitors our market risk exposures daily, 
using value-at-risk techniques alongside other risk metrics as appropriate.
Pension commitments
We have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is 
subject to capital market risks. We address key pension risks in a number 
of ways. A pensions forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, 
oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk 
committee supports the forum in reviewing the results of assurance 
processes with respect to pension risks. Local trustees manage the funded 
defined benefit pension plans and set the strategic asset allocation for 
the plan, including the extent to which currency, interest rate and 
inflation risks are hedged. The contributions paid are based on 
independent actuarial valuations that align with applicable local 
regulations. Pension fund liquidity is managed by holding appropriate 
liquid assets and maintaining credit facilities. Where appropriate, 
transactions to transfer pension liabilities to third parties are also 
considered. Our total employer contributions were $0.7 billion 
in 2023 and are estimated to be $0.5 billion in 2024.
See "Risk factors" on page 23 and Note 23 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
on pages 268-274.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Cash flow from operating activities in 2023 was $54.2 billion, 
compared with $68.4 billion in 2022. The cash flow from operating 
activities in 2023 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and 
working capital inflow of $7.8 billion (compared with working capital 
outflow of $5.4 billion in 2022), partly offset by tax payments of 
$13.7 billion (compared with tax payments of $13.1 billion in 2022), 
and derivatives outflow of $6.1 billion (compared with derivatives 
inflow of $0.6 billion in 2022).
Cash flow from investing activities in 2023 was an outflow of 
$17.7 billion, compared with an outflow of $22.4 billion in 2022. 
The cash flow from investing activities in 2023 included cash capital 
expenditure* of $24.4 billion (compared with cash capital expenditure 
of $24.8 billion in 2022), divestment proceeds* of $3.1 billion 
(compared with divestment proceeds of $2.1 billion in 2022), interest 
received of $2.1 billion (compared with interest received of $0.9 billion 
in 2022), and net other investing cash inflows of $1.4 billion (compared 
with net other investing cash outflows of $0.6 billion in 2022).
Cash flow from financing activities in 2023 was an outflow of 
$38.2 billion, compared with outflows of $42.0 billion in 2022, mainly 
due to lower repurchases of shares of $14.6 billion (2022: $18.4 
billion) and Derivative financial instruments favourable movement of 
$0.7 billion (2022: $1.8 billion unfavourable movement), partly offset 
by higher net repayment of debt of $9.8 billion (2022: $7.9 billion 
net repayment). 
Cash and cash equivalents were $38.8 billion at December 31, 
2023 (December 31, 2022: $40.2 billion).
Prior year Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the financial year 
ended December 31, 2022, compared with the financial year ended 
December 31, 2021, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 
(page 241) and Form 20-F (page 219) for the year ended December 
31, 2022, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and 
Wales and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively. 
See "Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows" on page 220.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Cash flow from operating activities
The most significant factors affecting our cash flow from operating 
activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices 
for crude oil, natural gas and LNG; production levels of crude oil, 
natural gas and LNG; chemicals, refining and marketing margins; 
and movements in working capital and derivative financial instruments. 
The impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends 
on: the extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market 
prices; the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of 
agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies 
that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax 
impacts; and the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow 
through into operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of 
crude oil and natural gas in any particular period provide only a broad 
indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings 
in that period. Changes in any factors, from within the industry or the 
broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing 
margins. The precise impact of any changes depends on how the oil 
markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors 
such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific 
grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; 
and the collective speed of response of refiners and product marketers 
in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region 
to region and from period to period.
Divestment and cash capital expenditure
The levels of divestment proceeds and cash capital expenditure in 
2023 and 2022 reflect our discipline and focus as we implement 
our Powering Progress strategy. Proceeds from sale of property, plant 
and equipment and businesses were $2.6 billion for 2023, compared 
with $1.4 billion in 2022 and divestment proceeds* for 2023 were 
$3.1 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in 2022. Cash capital 
expenditure split per segment is presented in the table below:

The table below summarises our principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2023, by expected settlement period. The amounts presented 
have not been offset by any committed third-party revenue in relation to these obligations.

Total  44.7  49.0  29.1  107.2  230.0 
[A] See Note 20 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". Debt contractual obligations exclude interest, which is estimated to be $1.6 billion payable in less than one year, $2.7 billion 
between one and three years, $2.4 billion between three and five years, and $13.4 billion in five years and later. For this purpose, we assume that interest rates with respect to variable 
interest rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect at December 31, 2023, and that there is no change in the aggregate principal amount of debt other than repayment at scheduled 
maturity as reflected in the table. Lease contractual obligations include interest.
[B] Purchase obligations disclosed in the above table exclude commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable and are principally intended to be resold in a short period of 
time through sale agreements with third parties. Examples include long-term non-cancellable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refined products or 
crude oil at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in measuring liquidity and cash flow, as the cash outflows generated by these purchases will generally be 
offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.
[C] Includes obligations included in "Trade and other payables" and provisions related to onerous contracts included in "Decommissioning and other provisions" in "Non-current liabilities" in the 
"Consolidated Balance Sheet" that are contractually fixed as to timing and amount. In addition to these amounts, Shell has certain obligations that are not contractually fixed as to timing and 
amount, including contributions to defined benefit pension plans (see Note 23 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements") and obligations associated with decommissioning and restoration 
(see Note 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements").
Dividends
Subject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per 
share by around 4% every year. In total, Shell targets the distribution 
of 30--40% of our cash flow from operations through the cycle to 
shareholders. Shell may choose to return cash to shareholders 
through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.
When setting the level of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at 
a range of factors, including the macro environment, the earnings and 
cash flows of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, 
acquisition and divestment plans and existing commitments. We 
returned $8.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends and 
$14.6 billion through share buybacks in 2023. Total shareholder 
distributions represented 42% of cash flow from operating activities*. 
The fourth quarter 2023 dividend of $0.344 per share will be paid
on March 25, 2024, to shareholders on the register at February 16, 
2024, and represents an increase of 4% compared with the third 
quarter of 2023.
See Note 29 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 286.
Purchases of securities
The intent to purchase shares was announced alongside the quarterly 
results during 2023, and covered the period up until the next quarterly 
announcement. In 2023, share buybacks of $4 billion were announced 
on February 2, $4 billion on May 4, $3 billion on July 27 and 
$3.5 billion on November 2 (finalised in the first quarter of 2024). 
In addition, on February 1, 2024, a further buyback of $3.5 billion 
was announced along with the fourth quarter 2023 results; it is 
intended that this will be completed by the announcement date
of the first quarter 2024 results.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
During 2023, 479.4 million ordinary shares were purchased 
and cancelled. Overall, a total nominal share value of €34 million 
($40 million), 6.8% of the Company's total issued share capital at 
December 31, 2022, was purchased and cancelled during 2023 for 
a total cost of $14.6 billion, including expenses, at an average price 
of $30.43 per share.
The buybacks completed in the first half of 2023 were in accordance 
with the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2022 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). The buybacks completed in the second 
half of 2023 were in accordance with the authorities granted by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM. At the 2023 AGM, authority was 
granted for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 10% of its 
issued ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares, (692 million ordinary 
shares), both on and off market, allowing purchases on Amsterdam as 
well as London exchanges. As at December 31, 2023, 512 million 
ordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM 
authorities. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2023 was to 
reduce the issued share capital of the Company.
New resolutions will be proposed at the 2024 AGM to renew the 
authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to 
specified limits, for a further year. These proposals will be described 
in more detail in the 2024 Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Shares are also purchased by the employee share ownership 
trusts and trust-like entities (see Note 27 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on page 283) to meet delivery commitments 
under employee share plans. All share purchases are made in
open-market transactions. 
The table on the next page provides information on purchases of shares 
in 2023 and January 2024 by the Company and affiliated purchasers. 
Purchases in euros and sterling are converted into dollars using the 
exchange rate on each transaction date.

Financial information relating to the Royal Dutch Shell 
Dividend Access Trust
The results of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the Trust) 
are included in the consolidated results of operations and financial 
position of Shell. Certain condensed financial information in respect 
of the Trust is given below.
The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited and BG Group 
Limited have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare 
Trustees (Jersey) Limited (the Trustee). For the years 2023, 2022 
and 2021, the Trust recorded income before tax of £nil, £nil, and 
£2.2 billion respectively. In each period, this reflected the amount 
of dividends payable on the dividend access shares. Dividends 
are also classified as unclaimed where amounts have not cleared 
recipient bank accounts.
At December 31, 2023, the Trust had total equity of £nil (December 31, 
2022: £nil; December 31, 2021: £nil), reflecting assets of £4 million 
(December 31, 2022: £6 million; December 31, 2021: £7 million) and 
unclaimed dividends of £4 million (December 31, 2022: £6 million; 
December 31, 2021: £7 million). The Trust only records a liability for 
an unclaimed dividend to the extent that dividend cheque payments 
have not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have 
been returned unpresented. As these unclaimed dividends relate to 
dividends that were announced by the Company during the period the 
Company was still named Royal Dutch Shell plc, and it is expected that 
the Company will not announce any further dividends on the dividend 
access shares, the Trust continues to be named the Royal Dutch Shell 
Dividend Access Trust. 
On January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through 
assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share 
of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or 
dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on 
dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the 
ordinary shares following the assimilation.
In relation to the assimilation of the Company's A and B shares, the 
Trust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate 
the payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for shareholders of the 
former B shares until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with 
the terms outlined. Dividends which are unclaimed after six years will 
be forfeited and unconditionally revert to The Shell Transport and 
Trading Company Limited and BG Group Limited, as appropriate.

Market overview
Shell maintains a large business portfolio across an integrated value 
chain and is exposed to fluctuating prices of crude oil, natural gas, 
oil products, chemicals and power.
See "Risk factors" on page 17. 
This diversified portfolio provides resilience when prices are volatile. 
Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim to 
ensure that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses 
are appropriate in the context of a volatile price environment. 
We prepare annual strategic and financial plans that test different 
scenarios and their impact on prices, our businesses and organisation. 
We test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against 
a range of prices for crude oil, natural gas, oil products, chemicals 
and power. Through this process, we identify potential interventions 
that we believe can drive value, preserve cash levels and maintain a 
strong balance sheet. This provides us with resilience against weak 
market prices.
The range of commodity prices and margins used in our project and 
portfolio evaluations is subject to a rigorous assessment of short-, 
medium- and long-term market drivers. These drivers include the 
extent and pace of the energy transition.

Global economic growth
After a strong economic recovery from the lows of the COVID-19 
pandemic, growth in 2023 was more moderate. Several forces are 
holding global economic growth back. These include the Russia-
Ukraine war and international trade restrictions. Others are more 
cyclical and include the effects of sharp interest rate increases and 
liquidity withdrawals by central banks intended to rein in inflation. 
Rising public debt is also resulting in governments withdrawing the 
fiscal support they extended during the pandemic. 
The latest World Economic Outlook, published by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 2024, estimated global economic 
growth from 2022 to 2023 to be 3.1%, down from 3.5% in 2022 and 
6.3% in 2021. Advanced economies continue to drive the decline in 
global growth, with weaker manufacturing offsetting stronger services 
activity. The slowdown was pronounced in Europe, while the USA 
remained relatively resilient. Developing economies, on average, 
have experienced stable growth over 2022-2023, although with 
sizeable shifts across regions. China experienced relatively strong 
growth, despite headwinds from its real estate crisis and weak 
consumer confidence. 
Looking to 2024, the IMF's projections for the global economy are 
consistent with a soft landing, with inflation declining and growth 
holding up despite the rise in interest rates. But there are several 
downside risks to the outlook. These include: volatile commodity prices 
amid geopolitical and climate change risks; and upward surprises in 
inflation and a corresponding tightening of financial conditions and 
fiscal consolidation that could weigh on growth. The IMF projects 
global growth to be around 3% over the medium term (2024-2028) — 
below the historical average of 3.8% over the past two decades. In the 
context of geopolitical risks, this is in an environment where interest 
rates are expected to be higher for longer.
Global prices, demand and supply
The following table provides an overview of the main crude oil 
and natural gas price markers to which Shell is exposed:
Oil and gas average industry prices [A]
2023 2022 2021
Brent ($/b)  83  101  71 
West Texas Intermediate ($/b)  78  95  68 
Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)  2.5  6.4  4.0 
EU TTF ($/MMBtu)  13  40  16 
Japan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b) - 3 months  89  98  60 
[A] Yearly average prices are based on monthly average spot prices. The 2023 average price 
for Japan Customs-cleared Crude is based on available market information up to the end 
of the period.
Crude oil and oil products 
The global benchmark oil price Brent averaged about $83 per 
barrel (bbl) in 2023, down from $101/bbl in 2022. This reflected 
a normalisation of the market from the period of significant volatility 
in 2022. As trade flows adjusted after the disruption caused by the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine and more supply became available, 
supply security concerns have eased and the market balance 
loosened in 2023. 
Global demand continued to recover in 2023, at a similar pace 
to 2022. Incremental demand has amounted to around 2.3 million 
barrels per day (mb/d), of which 1.7 mb/d came from China, where 
demand rebounded after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. However, 
demand growth in OECD markets, particularly OECD Europe, has 
moderated significantly because of slower economic growth. 
Global supply increased by around 1.9 mb/d in 2023, slightly slower 
than demand growth. Most of the non-OPEC growth has come from the 
USA and Brazil, which accounted for around 1.5 mb/d and 0.4 mb/d, 
respectively. Iran, which is exempt from the OPEC production cut, has 
also markedly ramped up supply. To balance the market, OPEC+, led 
by Saudi Arabia and Russia, implemented a series of moves to limit 
the supply available to the market. In April 2023, OPEC+ announced 
a 1.66 mb/d voluntary production cut. This was followed by an 
additional 1 mb/d voluntary cut by Saudi Arabia from May, which 
was eventually extended through to the first quarter of 2024, with 
possibility for a further extension. Russia also announced a production 
cut of 500 thousand barrels a day (kb/d) for March through to the end 
of 2023, in addition to a 300 kb/d exports reduction from September 
to the end of the year. The actual crude output from Saudi Arabia and 
Russia dropped by around 1 mb/d and 0.2 mb/d, respectively in 2023 
compared with 2022, based on the IEA estimate.

In 2024, the expected economic slowdown and potential supply 
disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions could impact demand. 
Macroeconomic risks and demand concerns had already started 
weighing on the market from the fourth quarter, with Brent dropping 
by $16/bbl by the end of 2023 from the year's peak. The instability in 
the Middle East remains a significant risk factor. As of now, conflicts in 
the vicinity of key oil trade routes, such as the Red Sea, have not yet 
caused severe disruption to supplies. But the risk of disruption could 
increase if the Israel-Hamas war escalates into a regional conflict.
Natural gas
Gas market 
Weak demand, combined with high inventories, has put downward 
pressure on natural gas prices in key markets in 2023. Although prices 
were lower than 2022 levels, they remained elevated versus historical 
levels and continued to show strong volatility. 
Title Transfer Facility (TTF): In Europe, TTF spot prices averaged
$13.15/MMBtu (62% lower year-on-year). Strong LNG imports 
and weak regional demand enabled European inventories to 
reach 110 billion cubic metres (bcm), almost 100% full at the end 
of October. By year-end, inventories fell to 95 bcm (86%), which 
is still a comfortable level for that time of the year. Despite storages 
at multi-year highs, supply-side risks in the Middle East, and the threat 
of renewed industrial action in Australia, increased price volatility in 
October, with spot TTF prices surging to $17.0/MMBtu by the middle 
of the month, a 40% increase from the start of the month. By year-end, 
prices retreated to $12.66/MMBtu as Egyptian exports and Israeli 
pipeline flows resumed and inventories remained elevated. 
Japan Korea Marker (JKM): Spot LNG prices in Asia followed a similar 
trajectory as in Europe, averaging $14.03/MMBtu (48% lower year-
on-year). LNG demand in China remained subdued in 2023, relative to 
previous years. The return of incremental nuclear capacity in Japan has 
kept inventories at elevated levels through much of the year, capping 
the upside in prices.
Henry Hub: Henry Hub gas benchmark prices in North America had 
a less volatile year compared with 2022. Spot prices ranged from 
$1.77/MMBtu to $3.77/MMBtu with an average of $2.54/MMBtu. 
The lower volatility was attributable to a warm first quarter, cool 
second quarter, stronger-than-expected dry gas production, an 
increase in LNG facility maintenance and a continued storage surplus. 
Temperatures in the first quarter averaged near three degrees warmer 
than normal. Temperatures in the second quarter averaged one degree 
cooler than normal. Winter 2023-2024 has been considerably warmer 
than the 10-year normal. In 2023, natural gas dry production averaged 
101.45 billion cubic feet a day (bcf/d) or 4.37 bcf/d above 2022. In 
the summer of 2023, natural gas storage in the 48 lower states of the 
USA averaged 467 bcf higher than in the summer of 2022.
The market is expected to remain loose through the remainder of the 
2023-2024 winter as production slowly increases and LNG export 
facilities undergo maintenance. The bearish sentiment is expected to 
continue into the summer of 2024, which is reflected by the softness 
of the prices seen in summer futures contracts on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 
Power
United States: US power prices were largely lower across all major 
markets in 2023 compared with 2022. One of the key drivers for 
the overall lower power prices and volatility in 2023 was the decline 
in gas prices. After a volatile 2022, where prices ranged from below 
$4/MMBtu to nearly $10/MMBtu, Henry Hub, the benchmark gas 
price in North America, stayed mostly below $3/MMBtu for most of 
2023. Power price volatilities were largely driven by weather events 
throughout the year and across the country. For the western part of 
the USA, colder than normal temperatures that started in December 
2022 lingered through March, resulting in strong prices in Mid-C (Mid-
Columbia) ($108/MWh) and CAISO (California) ($92/MWh) in the 
first quarter of 2023. For the eastern part of the USA, a combination 
of a warm winter and mild summer brought stable prices across the 
PJM and MISO (Midcontinent) markets. For Texas, record-breaking 
summer temperatures resulted in strong price performance. ERCOT 
(Texas) market prices spiked over $5,000/MWh in June, August 
and September, with On-Peak prices averaging $282/MWh for 
August and $121/MWh for September.
Europe: European power prices came down from the record levels 
in 2022, but were still elevated. In Germany, for example, the average 
power price in 2023 was around $103/MWh, down from an average 
price of $248/MWh in 2022. German power prices were still 
significantly higher than the average price of $38/MWh in the period 
2015-2019. Power prices are primarily driven by natural gas prices, 
which were lower in 2023 than in 2022, but still more than double the 
average of around $5.6/MMBtu between 2015 and 2019. In addition, 
the availability of both hydropower and French nuclear power plants 
was markedly better in 2023 than in 2022, resulting in lower power 
prices. The continued deployment of solar and wind capacity is 
progressively affecting power system operations, which can be 
seen from the impact of weather on hourly prices.
Australia: The power and gas markets in Eastern Australia began 2023 
with firm price caps on gas and coal after extreme price volatility in 
2022. This -- combined with lower demand because of milder winter 
weather, improved coal generator availability and continued growth 
in renewable generation -- reduced tightness in international markets. 
Healthy domestic gas storage and stronger winter flows from LNG 
producers to southern markets moderated gas and power prices as 
they returned to normal levels. Prices, however, continued to be higher 
than historical levels. Power prices averaged around A$90/MWh for 
2023 compared with A$190/MWh in 2022 and A$75/MWh in 
2021. Gas prices averaged around A$12/GJ (gigajoule) for 2023 
compared with around A$40/GJ in 2022 and A$10/GJ in 2021. 
There has also been increased intraday volatility, as more renewables 
and distributed solar have entered the system to replace coal. 
Crude oil and natural gas price assumptions
Our ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial 
opportunities depends on the accuracy of our price assumptions. We 
use a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market 
uncertainties to determine what ranges of future crude oil and natural 
gas prices to use in project and portfolio evaluations. Market 
uncertainties include, for example, future economic conditions, 
geopolitics, actions by major resource holders, production costs, 
technological progress and the balance of supply and demand.

Refining and chemical margins 
In 2023, gross refining margins continued to be well-supported, albeit 
at a lower level than the highs seen in 2022. The effect of sanctions on 
Russian oil products meant that Europe was short of middle distillate, 
leading to low stocks and very high middle distillate product crack 
spreads. This was exacerbated by refinery slowdowns during the hot 
European summer as cooling systems struggled to cope. In addition, 
there were low US gasoline stocks at the start of the US summer 
holiday season when demand was rising as many more people were 
driving. This led to a wider spread between gasoline and crude in the 
Atlantic basin. In the East, Chinese oil demand growth was capped by 
the economic slowdown. The low product stocks of gasoline and diesel 
in the Atlantic basin required product flow from Asia providing margin 
support for Asian refineries outside of China. But this was dampened by 
Chinese product export quotas which remained at the same elevated 
level as in 2022. In 2023, new refinery capacity -- such as the Al Zour 
refinery, the Beaumont expansion and Oman Duqm refinery -- came 
on line and increased product supply to the market, keeping margins at 
a lower level than in 2022.
For 2024, further new refinery capacity, such as that from Dangote 
in Nigeria, is expected to come on line. Meanwhile, demand growth 
is expected to slow with China's economic outlook being a key factor. 
Currently, product stock levels in the Atlantic basin of mogas and 
diesel are at higher levels than a year ago, suggesting lower 
spreads between products and crude oil next year.
Chemical cracker margins remained pressured in 2023 because 
of global oversupply and weak demand. Slowing global market 
conditions, and high inflation and interest rates, have impacted end-
consumer demand. New capacity growth, primarily in Asia and the 
USA, led to global oversupply with producers continuing to match 
demand through lower cracker utilisation. The Russia-Ukraine war 
and conflicts in the Middle East have impacted energy prices, 
resulting in lower margins.
The outlook for petrochemical margins in 2024 and beyond depends 
on feedstock costs and the balance of supply and demand. Global 
oversupply is expected to persist through the year with a slow demand 
recovery. A recovery in demand is needed to absorb excess capacity. 
The supply of petrochemicals will depend on how new facilities coming 
on line and plant closures will impact net capacity, with utilisation 
balancing the system. Product prices will reflect the cost of raw 
materials, which is closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices.
Refining margins

Indicative refining margin  12.45  18.03  4.79 
[A] The Indicative refining margin (IRM) is an approximation of Shell's global gross refining 
unit margin, calculated using price markers from third-party databases. It is based on a 
simplified crude and product yield profile at a nominal level of refining performance. The 
actual margins realised by Shell may vary due to factors including specific local market 
effects, refinery maintenance, crude diet optimisation as the crudes in the IRM are 
indicative benchmark crudes, operating decisions and product demand. Gross refining

[A] The Indicative chemical margin (ICM) is an approximation of Shell's global chemical 
margin performance trend (including equity-accounted associates), calculated using price 
markers from third-party databases. It is based on a simplified feedstock and product yield 
profile at a nominal level of plant performance. The actual margins realised by Shell may 
vary due to factors including specific local market effects, chemical plants maintenance, 
optimisation, operating decisions and product demand. Chemical unit margin is defined 
as the hydrocarbon margin net of purchased/sold utilities, additives and relevant freight 
costs, divided by a nominal denominator expressed in metric tonnes. It is only applicable 
to the impact of market pricing on Chemical business performance.

gas (LNG) and the conversion of natural gas 
into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and base oils. IG 
activities also include natural gas exploration 
and extraction, and the operation of the 
upstream and midstream infrastructure 
necessary to deliver gas and gas products 
to market. The marketing, trading and 
optimisation of LNG is also part of IG. We are 
committed to investing in our IG activities and 
plan to continue growing our LNG portfolio.

Business conditions
For the business conditions relevant to Integrated Gas,
see "Market overview" on pages 36-38.
Production available for sale 
In 2023, natural gas production increased by 2% compared 
with 2022, mainly because of the new fields and ramp-up in 
Oman, Canada, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago. Lower levels 
of maintenance at Pearl GTL in Qatar, and in Trinidad and Tobago 
also contributed to the higher production levels. These were partly 
offset by the derecognition of Russia's Sakhalin-related volumes 
and production-sharing contract effects in Egypt and at Pearl GTL. 
In 2023 and 2022, natural gas and liquids made up 86% and 14% 
of total production, respectively.
LNG liquefaction and sales volumes
LNG liquefaction volumes decreased by 5% compared with the 
previous year, mainly as a result of the derecognition of Sakhalin-
related volumes.
LNG sales volumes increased primarily because of higher purchases 
from third parties but this was partly offset by the derecognition of 
Sakhalin-related volumes.
Through our trading organisation, we market and sell a portion of 
our share of equity production of LNG together with third-party LNG 
through our hubs in the UK, the UAE and Singapore. Shell has term 
sales contracts for the majority of our LNG liquefaction and term 
purchase contracts. We are able to optimise the income we generate 
from our LNG cargoes through our shipping network, regasification 
terminals and ability to purchase and deliver LNG spot cargoes from 
third parties. For example, if one customer does not need a scheduled 
cargo, we can deliver it to another customer who does need it. 
Similarly, if a customer needs an additional cargo not available from 
our production facilities, we contract with third parties to deliver the 
additional cargo. We conduct paper trades, primarily to manage 
commodity price risk related to sales and purchase contracts. 
We also sell LNG for trucks in India, China and Europe, and 
LNG for shipping in the USA, Europe and Singapore.

Earnings 2023-2022
Segment earnings in 2023 were lower in comparison to 2022 and 
reflected the net effect of lower realised prices and higher contributions 
from trading and optimisation (decrease of $1,143 million), lower 
volumes (decrease of $466 million), and unfavourable deferred 
tax movements (decrease of $728 million). 
Segment earnings included identified items: mainly unfavourable 
movements of $4,407 million due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives and net impairment charges and reversals 
of $2,247 million. In 2022, identified items included favourable 
movements of $6,273 million due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives and net impairment reversals of $779 million. 
In 2022, these were partly offset by other impacts of $608 million, 
mainly loan write-downs, as well as charges of $387 million as 
provisions for onerous contracts.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings, and adjusted for identified items.

Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 39) and Form 
20-F (page 43) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively. 
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities for 2023 was primarily driven by 
Adjusted EBITDA and a working capital inflow of $2,023 million, partly 
offset by net cash outflows, related to derivatives of $4,668 million, 
and tax payments of $3,574 million.
Cash capital expenditure
Our cash capital expenditure in 2023 was at the same level as 
in 2022. Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be around 
$5 billion in 2024.
Portfolio and business development 
Significant portfolio and business developments: 
￮ In January 2023, we produced first gas from Oman's Mabrouk 
North-East field in Block 10 (Shell interest 53.45%).
￮ In June 2023, we completed the purchase of 25% of the 
shareholding in the QatarEnergy LNG NFS(2) joint venture, which 
owns a 37% interest in the North Field South (NFS) project. Shell's 
ownership of NFS via its joint-venture shareholding is 9.375%.
￮ In October 2023, we sold our 35% interest in Indonesia's Masela 
PSC to Indonesia's PT Pertamina Hulu Energi and PETRONAS 
Masela Sdn. Bhd. The sale included the Abadi gas project.
￮ In October 2023, we and our partners in the Oman LNG LLC 
venture signed an amended shareholders' agreement for Oman LNG 
LLC (Oman LNG), extending the business beyond 2024. We will 
remain the largest private shareholder in Oman LNG, with a 30% 
interest.
￮ In December 2023, Shell entered into agreements with the 
government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Atlantic 
LNG shareholders to restructure the Atlantic LNG facility, which will 
change Shell's overall shareholding in Atlantic LNG. These changes 
aim to take effect in a phased approach, starting on October 1, 
2024, and are expected to be completed by May 2, 2027. On 
completion, Shell is expected to have a 45% share in Atlantic LNG.

First gas from Block 10 in heartland of Oman
We produced first gas from Oman's Mabrouk North-East field 
in Block 10 (Shell interest 53.45%) in 2023. Block 10 is our first 
operated venture in the country, a market that is core to our 
integrated gas and upstream strategy. 
Phase 1 of Block 10 was developed in close cooperation with 
Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), which is a joint venture 
operated by the government of Oman (60%), Shell (34%), 
TotalEnergies (4%) and Partex (2%).
Production from Block 10 started in January 2023 and is expected 
to reach 0.5 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day by the 
middle of 2024. The gas is supplied to Oman's gas network, which 
feeds local industries and export facilities, such as Oman LNG. 
When Shell became operator of Block 10 in March 2022, 
we sought to provide quality accommodation for employees 
and contractors at Block 10. We are building a 590-bed 
accommodation unit with catering, sports facilities and WiFi 
access for our staff and contractors in the field.
We have also implemented a comprehensive road safety 
programme at Block 10. The programme is not limited to Shell 
operations but has already supported changes to road safety 
regulations in Oman. Shell, together with the Royal Oman Police 
and the Ministry of Education, has also set up a road safety 
educational programme and curriculum for children in Oman. 
Shell has been present in Oman for more than 80 years. As part 
of our own net-zero targets and the ambitions of Oman, we are 
evaluating a potential hydrogen project, which could be supplied 
by gas from Block 10. There is potential for the produced CO2 
to be stored underground and supplied to manufacture low-
carbon products.

Oil and natural gas production, exploration and development
Australia 
We operate the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) venture's natural 
gas operations in Queensland's Surat Basin. Our interests range from 
44% to 74% in 25 field compression stations and six central processing 
plants. Our production of natural gas from the onshore Surat Basin 
supplies the QCLNG liquefaction plant and the domestic gas market. 
We have a 50% interest in Arrow, a Queensland-based joint venture 
with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Arrow owns 
coalbed methane assets and a domestic power business.
In addition, Shell has interests in offshore production, LNG liquefaction 
and exploration licences in the Browse Basin and in the North West 
Shelf (NWS) and Greater Gorgon areas of the Carnarvon Basin. 
Woodside is the operator on behalf of the NWS joint venture (Shell 
interest 16.7%). We have a 25% interest in the Chevron-operated 
Gorgon LNG joint venture that includes offshore production.
In the Browse Basin, Shell operates the Prelude field (Shell interest 
67.5%), the Crux gas and condensate development field (Shell interest 
84.5%) and other backfill projects for Prelude FLNG.
In 2023, we sold our stake in the Browse joint arrangement (Shell 
interest 27%), which covers the Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa 
gas fields. 
Bolivia
We hold a 37.5% interest in the Caipipendi block where we produce 
and deliver natural gas to domestic and export markets. Repsol is the 
operator. We also have a 25% interest in the Tarija XX West block, 
where we produce from the Itaú field. 
Canada
In Canada, we produce and market natural gas, natural gas liquids 
and condensate. We hold mineral acres, primarily in the Montney 
play in British Columbia and Alberta. We operate four natural gas 
processing area facilities at our Groundbirch asset in British Columbia, 
with another natural gas processing facility under construction. 
China
We develop and produce from the onshore Changbei tight-gas 
field under a PSC with China National Petroleum Company.
Egypt 
We have a 25% interest in the Burullus Gas Company (Burullus) joint 
venture, which operates the West Delta Deep Marine concession
(Shell interest 50%) and supplies gas to the domestic market and an 
Egyptian LNG plant. We have a 50% interest in the Rashid Petroleum 
Company (Rashpetco) joint venture, which operates the Rosetta 
concession (Shell interest 100%). We have a 30% interest in the
El Burg Offshore Company (EBOC) joint venture, which operates
the El Burg offshore concession (Shell interest 60%). 
We have interests in several exploration concessions in the Nile Delta, 
the wider East Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
Oman
We have an operated concession to develop and produce natural 
gas and condensate from Block 10 (Shell interest 53.45%). We have a 
separate gas sales agreement and oil supply agreement for production 
from the block. We also have an exploration and production-sharing 
agreement with the government for the exploration and appraisal of 
natural gas and condensate in Block 11 (Shell interest 67.5%), 
operated by Shell.
Qatar
We operate the Pearl GTL plant (Shell interest 100%) in Qatar under
a development and production-sharing contract with the government. 
The fully integrated facility has the capacity to produce, process and 
transport 1.6 billion standard cubic feet per day (scf/d) of gas from 
Qatar's North Field. 
We have a 30% interest in QatarEnergy LNG N(4), which comprises 
integrated facilities to produce around 1.4 billion scf/d of gas from 
Qatar's North Field, an onshore gas-processing facility operated by 
QatarEnergy LNG. We also have 25% of the shareholding in the 
QatarEnergy LNG NFE(2) joint venture which owns a 25% interest in 
the North Field East (NFE) project. Thus, Shell's ownership of NFE via 
its joint-venture shareholding is 6.25%. In June 2023, we purchased 
25% of the shareholding in the QatarEnergy LNG NFS(2) joint venture 
which owns a 37% interest in the North Field South (NFS) project. 
Shell's ownership of NFS via its joint-venture shareholding is 9.375%. 
Russia
In the first quarter of 2022, Shell announced its intent to withdraw 
in a phased manner from its involvements in all Russian hydrocarbons, 
including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG. Note 6 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2022, presented in the "Annual Report and Accounts and Form 20-F" 
for that year, sets out Shell's progress made with respect to such 
intention, including its exit from the Sakhalin-2 project. Shell still holds 
a 27.5% (minus one share) interest in Sakhalin Energy Investment 
Company Ltd. (SEIC), a Bermudan entity, which purportedly no longer 
holds any licences, rights and obligations in Sakhalin-2. The accounting 
treatment of SEIC is stated and explained in Note 14 "Investments in 
securities" to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 259. In 
February 2023, Shell noted that SEIC had renounced a long-term LNG 
purchase contract by failing to perform, meaning the contract stood 
terminated. Shell still holds one long-term LNG purchase contract with 
a Novatek entity.
Trinidad and Tobago
We have interests in three concessions with producing fields: Central 
Block (Shell interest 65%), North Coast Marine Area (Shell interest 
80.5%) and East Coast Marine Area (Shell interest 100%). 
We have a 100% interest in exploration blocks 5(c)REA, 5(d) and 6(d). 
In 2023, we signed PSCs for three new exploration blocks 25a, 25b 
and 27 in the Columbus Basin (Shell interest 50%). We operate Block 
27 and BP is the operator of the remaining two. Additionally, we 
relinquished our 35% interest in the PSC for Atlantic Area Block 5.
Other
We also have interests in Barbados, Colombia, Cyprus and Tanzania.
In 2023, we sold our interest (35%) in the Masela PSC in Indonesia, 
which includes the Abadi gas project.

Business conditions
For the business conditions relevant to Upstream, see "Market 
overview" on pages 36-38.
Production available for sale
In 2023, liquids production was flat and natural gas production 
decreased by 16%, compared with 2022.
Total production, compared with 2022, decreased mainly due to the 
impact of divestments. The impact of field decline was more than offset 
by growth from new fields.
Earnings 2023-2022
Segment earnings, compared with 2022, mainly reflected lower 
realised oil and gas prices (decrease of $5,696 million) and lower 
volumes (decrease of $2,001 million).
Segment earnings in 2023 also included net impairment charges 
and reversals of $642 million, and net charges of $295 million, 
which related to the impact of the weakening Argentine peso and 
strengthening Brazilian real on a deferred tax position. These 
charges and gains are part of identified items and compare with 
2022, where segment earnings included net impairment reversals 
and charges of $853 million, and charges of $1,385 million relating 
to the EU solidarity contribution and $802 million relating to the UK 
Energy Profits Levy.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings and adjusted for identified items.
Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 45) and Form 
20-F (page 49) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities for 2023 was primarily driven by 
Adjusted EBITDA, partly offset by tax payments of $8,470 million.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure in 2023 was higher, compared with 2022. 
The increase was mainly a result of the ramp-up of projects in the Gulf 
of Mexico, Malaysia and the UK. This was partially offset by the Brazil 
Atapu Transfer of Rights in 2022. Cash capital expenditure is expected 
to be around $8 billion in 2024.
Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business developments:
￮ In February 2023, we started production at our operated Vito 
floating production facility (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of 
Mexico.

Business and property
Our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are involved in all 
aspects of upstream activities. These activities include land tenure and 
the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas 
and natural gas liquids. They also include the marketing and 
transportation of oil and gas, as well as the operation of the 
infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market.
The conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which oil and 
gas interests are held vary from country to country.
 
In almost all cases outside North America, legal agreements are 
generally granted by, or entered into with, a government, state-owned 
company, government-run oil and gas company or agency. The 
exploration risk usually rests with the independent oil and gas 
company. In North America, these agreements may also be with 
private parties that own mineral rights.
Of these agreements, the following are most relevant to our interests:
￮ Licences (or concessions), which entitle the holder to explore for 
hydrocarbons and exploit any commercial discoveries. Under a 
licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and 
production activities, and is responsible for financing these activities. 
In principle, the licence holder is entitled to the totality of production 
less any royalties in kind. The government, state-owned company or 
government-run oil and gas company may sometimes enter into a 
joint arrangement as a participant, sharing the rights and obligations 
of the licence but usually without sharing the exploration risk. In a 
few cases, the state-owned company, government-run oil and gas 
company or agency has an option to purchase a certain share of 
production.
￮ Lease agreements, which are typically used in North America and 
are usually governed by terms similar to licences. Participants may 
include governments or private entities. Royalties are paid either in 
cash or in kind.
￮ Production-sharing contracts (PSCs) entered into with a government, 
state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company. PSCs 
generally oblige the independent oil and gas company, as 
contractor, to provide all the financing and bear the risk of 
exploration, development and production activities in exchange for 
a share of the production. Usually, this share consists of a fixed or 
variable part that is reserved for the recovery of the contractor's cost 
(cost oil). The remaining production is split with the government, 
state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company on a 
fixed or volume/revenue-dependent basis. In some cases, the 
government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas 
company will participate in the rights and obligations of the 
contractor and will share in the costs of development and 
production. Such participation can be across the venture or on a 
field-by-field basis. Additionally, as the price of oil or gas increases 
above certain predetermined levels, the independent oil and gas 
company's entitlement share of production normally decreases, and 
vice versa. Accordingly, its interest in a project may not be the same 
as its entitlement.
Europe
Germany
Shell is a 50% shareholder in BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH & Co. 
KG (BEB), which owns interests in various concessions, mainly in 
Lower Saxony. ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH has a 
service contract with BEB, under which it provides operating services 
to BEB for most of the concessions.
Italy
Shell has a 39% interest in the Val d'Agri producing concession, 
operated by ENI S.p.A., and a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa 
producing concession, operated by TotalEnergies EP Italia S.p.A.
Netherlands
Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse 
Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM). NAM holds a 60% interest in the 
onshore low-calorific Groningen gas field (the remaining 40% interest 
is held by EBN, a Dutch government entity), the Schoonebeek oil 
field, some 25 smaller hydrocarbon production licences and two 
underground gas storage facilities.
The Dutch government issues annual gas production instructions for the 
Groningen field. As per the latest instruction, production has ceased 
since October 1, 2023. However, the Dutch government has indicated 
to NAM it could decree a restart of minimal production in exceptional 
circumstances during the current gas year, which occurred on January 
8-10, 2024, for a cold spell of several days.
Historical production from the Groningen field induces earthquakes 
which have led to damage claims, security concerns, and a strengthening 
operation to make buildings earthquake resistant. In June 2018, NAM's 
shareholders and the Dutch government signed a Heads of Agreement 
(HoA) to inter alia reduce, and eventually cease production from the 
Groningen field. Under the terms of the HoA, it was agreed that the 
Dutch government would pass on to NAM costs insofar as the costs 
corresponded to NAM's liability. Further agreements were signed to 
implement the HoA. As part of these agreements, Shell guaranteed half 
of NAM's 60% share of earthquake-related costs for damage claims and 
the strengthening of buildings. We are currently in discussions with the 
Dutch government about appropriate financial securities for the longer 
term as agreed under the HoA.
NAM is working with the Dutch government and other stakeholders to 
fulfil its obligations to residents of the area. These include compensating 
for damage caused by the earthquakes and paying to strengthen 
houses where this is required for safety. In 2022, NAM started 
arbitrations with the Dutch government to have its financial liability 
determined for costs which the Dutch government compensated to 
claimants and subsequently charged to NAM.
In October 2021, NAM announced that it would split up its non-
Groningen assets into several new legal entities, with the intent to 
divest those legal entities. No split-up has occurred to date.
See "NAM (Groningen gas field) Litigation" on page 287.
Norway
Shell is a partner in 19 production licences on the Norwegian 
continental shelf, and the operator of seven of these. We have 
interests in two producing gas fields: Shell-operated Ormen Lange 
(Shell interest 17.8%) and Equinor-operated Troll (Shell interest 8.1%). 
Additionally, we hold an interest in the Equinor-operated Irpa (Shell 
interest 10%) gas discovery under development. We operate two 
fields which are being decommissioned, Knarr and Gaupe. We are 
also the technical service provider for the Nyhamna processing plant, 
operated by Gassco.

UK
Shell operates a number of assets on the UK continental shelf mostly 
under unincorporated joint-venture agreements. Shell also has non-
operated positions in the West of Shetland area, including Clair (Shell 
interest 27.97%) and Schiehallion (Shell interest 44.89%). Both Clair 
and Schiehallion are operated by BP.
In April 2023, Shell restarted operations at the Pierce field (Shell 
interest 92.5%) in the UK North Sea after a major redevelopment to 
enable gas production, after years of the field producing only oil. The 
Haewene Brim floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) 
vessel, which produces from the Pierce field, is currently shutdown to 
address an integrity threat to the mooring lines. The work is nearing 
completion with production expected to resume in the near future.
Progress continues to develop the operated Penguins FPSO vessel 
(Shell interest 50%) and the Jackdaw platform (Shell interest 100%) 
in the North Sea. Both are expected to become operational in the 
mid-2020s.
In November 2023, we completed the sale of our 30% stake in 
the Cambo field to Ithaca Energy, following regulatory approval. 
The agreement to sell was signed in September 2023.
During the third quarter of 2023, the UK government announced that the 
Acorn carbon capture, utilisation and storage project (Shell interest 30%) 
was selected as one of two clusters to enter "Track 2" of the UK's cluster 
sequencing process for carbon capture and storage (CCS). In 2024, we 
expect to start more detailed discussions on the project between the UK 
government and the Acorn co-venturers. It was also announced that 
Acorn had received CCS licences from the North Sea Transition Authority 
for the Acorn East and East Mey CO2 stores, expanding its transport and 
storage system's capacity deep beneath the North Sea. In addition, 
ventures in which Shell has a 50% interest were awarded three carbon 
storage appraisal licences.
Decommissioning of the Heather A platform and Curlew FPSO asset 
continued in 2023, and we began a campaign of subsea well plug 
and abandonment activity to decommission 25 wells in the Central 
North Sea. All remaining staff left Brent Charlie on October 6, 2023, 
bringing 47 years of continuous presence on Brent installations to an 
end. We expect the topside to be lifted in 2024. The Offshore 
Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) 
continues to assess the Brent Field decommissioning programme for 
the Brent gravity-based substructures.
Rest of Europe
Shell also has interests in Albania.
Asia (including the Middle East and Russia)
Brunei
Shell and the Brunei government are 50:50 shareholders in Brunei 
Shell Petroleum Company Sendirian Berhad (BSP). BSP has long-term 
onshore and offshore oil and gas concession rights and sells most of its 
gas production to Brunei LNG Sendirian Berhad, with the remainder 
sold in the domestic market.
In addition to our interest in BSP, we have a non-operated interest in 
the offshore Block B concession (Shell interest 35%) which is operated 
by TotalEnergies. The gas and condensate are produced from the 
Maharaja Lela field.
We have a non-operated interest under a PSC in a gas-holding area 
for deep-water Block CA2, which is operated by Petronas. Shell's 
interest increased in 2023 from 12.5% to 20% when we acquired 
7.5% from Petronas.
We operate the deep-water Block CA1 (Shell interest 86.95%), in 
which the Jagus East field is located, under a PSC. As referred to in the 
Malaysia section, the Jagus East field and the Geronggong field, held 
by BSP, form part of the unitised GKGJE field. In 2023, we relinquished 
the exploration acreage that formed part of Block CA1.
Iraq
Shell has a 44% interest in the Basrah Gas Company, which gathers, 
treats and processes associated gas that was previously flared from the 
Rumaila, West Qurna 1 and Zubair fields. Processed gas and 
associated products, such as condensate and LPG, are sold to the 
domestic market. Any surplus condensate and LPG is exported.
Kazakhstan
Shell is the joint operator with ENI S.p.A. of the onshore Karachaganak 
oil and condensate field (Shell interest 29.3%) and, in north-west 
Kazakhstan which covers more than 280 square kilometres.
We also have an interest in the North Caspian Sea PSA (Shell interest 
16.8%) which includes the Kashagan field in the Kazakh sector of the 
Caspian Sea. The North Caspian Operating Company is the operator. 
This shallow-water field covers around 3,400 square kilometres.
We have a 7.4% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), 
which owns and operates an oil pipeline running from the Caspian 
Sea to the Black Sea across parts of Kazakhstan and Russia. We hold 
our interest in the CPC via three legal entities. Two of these are wholly 
owned by Shell and the other is a joint venture with Rosneft, Rosneft-
Shell Caspian Ventures Ltd (Cyprus) (RSCV) (Shell interest 49%), 
which was formed in 1996 to own and manage pipeline capacity 
rights. We continue to manage our interest in CPC held through RSCV 
in full compliance with applicable laws, including sanctions.
Kuwait
The wholly owned Shell Kuwait Exploration and Production B.V. 
holds three Enhanced Technical Service Agreements with Kuwait 
Oil Company. These contracts run up to 2026 for Jurassic Gas and 
2027 for Conventional Oil and Heavy Oil.
Malaysia
Shell explores for and produces oil and gas off the coast of Sabah 
and Sarawak under 19 PSCs, in which our interests range from 21% 
to 92.5%.
Offshore Sabah
We operate two producing oil fields: the Malikai deep-water field 
(Shell interest 35%) in the Block G PSC, and the unitised Gumusut-
Kakap Geronggong-Jagus East (GKGJE) field which straddles the 
Malaysia-Brunei border (Shell interest 37.89%).
We hold a 50% participating interest in exploration phase Block 2W, 
SB-X PSC and ND6/7 PSCs. The exploration activities in Block ND6/7 
PSC have been suspended because of Malaysia's border disputes with 
Indonesia.
We have non-operated interests of 21% in the unitised Siakap North-
Petai deep-water field in Block G and 30% in the Kebabangan 
Cluster PSC.
In our non-operated portfolio, we hold exploration interests ranging 
from 25.1% to 40% in the Block SB 2K, N and SB2V PSCs.

Offshore Sarawak
We are the operator of eight producing gas fields and one producing 
oil and gas field holding interests ranging from 30% to 50%. Nearly 
all the gas produced offshore Sarawak is supplied to Malaysia LNG 
(MLNG) and to our gas-to-liquids plant in Bintulu. The fields are under 
the MLNG, SK308, SK408 and SK308 PSCs.
We are also the operator for the Block SK318 PSC. This block contains 
the Timi field (Shell interest 75%), and the Rosmari-Marjoram fields 
(Shell interest 80%). Rosmari is unitised between the Block SK318 PSC 
and Block SK316 PSC (no Shell interest) with the resulting Shell interest 
at 68%. Rosmari-Marjoram is a natural gas project situated around 
220 kilometres off the coast of Bintulu, comprising a remotely operated 
offshore platform and onshore gas plant. Rosmari-Marjoram will mainly 
be powered by renewable energy from solar power offshore and 
hydroelectric power onshore. Timi achieved first gas in August 2023 
and the gas is moved through an 80-kilometre pipeline to the F23 
production hub.
We hold participating interests ranging from 70% to 92.5% in the 
exploration phase Block SK312, SK437, SK439 and SK440 PSCs. In 
March 2023, we signed one new PSC for Block SK3B (Shell interest 
45%), a deep-water block, off the coast of Sarawak.
In our non-operated portfolio, we hold a 20% interest in the Pegaga 
field under the Block SK320 PSC and a 30% interest in the Jerun field 
which is part of the Block SK408 PSC. Jerun is a gas development with 
an integrated central processing platform. The Block SK408 PSC also 
contains the producing non-operated Larak and Bakong fields.
In March 2023, we divested our 50% interest in the offshore Block 
SK307 PSC and our 40% interest in the offshore Baram Delta 
Operations (BDO) PSC to Petroleum Sarawak Exploration & 
Production Sdn. Bhd.
Timi platform, powered by sun 
and wind, achieves first gas 
Our unmanned solar- and wind-powered platform in the Timi gas 
field (Shell interest 75%) shows how we are working to produce 
energy with less emissions. Timi delivered first gas in August 
2023 and is expected to produce up to 50,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day at peak production. 
The Timi field is situated about 200 kilometres (km) off the 
coast of Sarawak, Malaysia, and is part of our operated SK318 
production-sharing contract. Timi features Shell's first wellhead 
platform in Malaysia that is powered by a solar and wind hybrid 
power system. The design demonstrates our Upstream business's 
ability to deliver projects that support a balanced energy 
transition. In addition to delivering value for shareholders with 
less emissions, Timi is also more cost efficient to operate because 
it is around 60% lighter in weight than a conventional drilling 
wellhead platform that relies on oil and gas for power. 
The field qualifies as a critical habitat because it lies within the 
Luconia Shoals National Park where migratory mammals, turtles 
and coral reefs are found. The project therefore required a 
biodiversity action plan designed with conservation initiatives in 
collaboration with the local university. 
Timi is not the only Shell asset in Malaysia powered by 
renewable energy. In May 2020, we produced first gas from 
a fully solar-powered platform in the Gorek field, about 145 km 
offshore Malaysia. In 2022, we took the final investment 
decision on the Rosmari-Marjoram gas project, the largest 
integrated offshore and onshore project in Sarawak, which 
will be primarily powered by renewable energy. 
Shell retains a strong presence in Malaysia's upstream, gas-to-
liquids, downstream and business services sectors. We remain 
committed to supporting the country's economic progress and 
energy transition efforts through competitive and resilient 
investments.

oil produced from Block 6 through its interest in Private Oil Holdings 
Oman Ltd. The government of Oman has a 60% interest in PDO and 
the Block 6 oil concession through its wholly owned company, Energy 
Development Oman (EDO). PDO operates a concession area of about 
90,000 square kilometres and has more than 200 producing oil fields.
We have a 50% interest in Block 42 under an Exploration and 
Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) where Shell is the operator. The 
other 50% interest is held by the government through its wholly owned 
company, OQ. We have a 100% interest in Block 55 under an EPSA.
Russia
In the first quarter of 2022, Shell announced its intent to withdraw in 
a phased manner from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, 
including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG. In connection 
with this:
￮ On February 22, 2023, Shell completed the sale of its 50% interest 
in the CJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Petroleum Alliance to a subsidiary of 
GazpromNeft (GPN); and
￮ On March 3, 2023, Shell completed the sale of its 50% interest in 
Salym Petroleum Development LLC to a subsidiary of GPN. Salym 
Petroleum Development N.V. (SPD), a joint operation with GPN 
which was formerly developing the Salym project and in which Shell 
previously had a 50% interest, was liquidated in December 2023, 
and its wholly owned subsidiary Salym Petroleum Services B.V. was 
liquidated in November 2023.
Syria
Shell holds a 65% interest in Syria Shell Petroleum Development B.V. 
(SSPD), a joint venture between Shell and the China National 
Petroleum Corporation. SSPD holds a 31.25% interest in Al Furat 
Petroleum Company, a Syrian joint stock company, whose role was to 
perform petroleum operations. Shell also holds a 70% interest in two 
exploration licences via Shell South Syria Exploration B.V. In December 
2011, in compliance with international sanctions on Syria, including 
European Council Decision 2011/782/CFSP, Shell suspended all 
exploration and production activities in Syria. SSPD continued to fulfil 
minimum contractual obligations towards the Syrian finance and labour 
ministries, in compliance with applicable trade control laws. In 2023, 
as part of the minimum contractual obligations, payments for taxes 
related to salary and social security amounted to $1,350.
Rest of Middle East and Asia
Shell also has interests in the United Arab Emirates.
Africa
Nigeria
Shell operates a number of interests in onshore and offshore oil 
exploration and production assets in Nigeria. 
Onshore
The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) 
is the operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV, Shell interest 30%) 
which has 15 Niger Delta onshore oil mining leases (OMLs). 
SPDC also has three shallow-water oil mining leases (OML 74, 77 and 
79) and a 40% interest in the non-operated Sunlink joint venture, which 
has one shallow-water lease (OML 144).
On January 16, 2024, Shell agreed to sell SPDC to Renaissance, 
subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other 
conditions. As part of the transaction, parties have agreed a sharing 
mechanism that, upon completion, will give Shell an interest in the 
performance of the export feedgas business going forward. Shell will 
retain its interest in one shallow-water lease (OML 144).
Offshore
Our main offshore deep-water activities are carried out by our wholly 
owned subsidiary Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company 
Limited (SNEPCo). SNEPCo has interests in three deep-water blocks 
that are under PSC terms: the producing assets Bonga (OML 118) and 
Erha (OML 133), and the non-producing asset Bolia Chota (OML 135). 
SNEPCo operates OML 118 (Shell interest 55%), including the Bonga 
field FPSO vessel. We also operate OML 135, encompassing the Bolia 
and Doro fields (Shell interest 55%). We have a 43.8% non-operated 
interest in OML 133 (including the Erha FPSO).
Authorities have investigated our involvement in the 2011 settlement of 
litigation pertaining to OPL 245.
See Note 31 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 286-288.
Business update
In 2021, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) entered into effect, creating a 
new regulatory framework for the petroleum industry in Nigeria. The 
PIA introduces significant changes and we are actively engaged in the 
implementation process to ensure that these changes are implemented 
in a timely manner in our operations.
Security issues, sabotage and crude oil theft in the Niger Delta 
continued and remained significant challenges to our onshore 
operations in 2023. We will continue to monitor the situation closely 
and evaluate implications for the integrity of our infrastructure and the 
sustainability of our current operations. We continue to put the safety 
of our employees and contractors first.
In our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse 
conditions which could have a significant adverse effect on our 
operational performance, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Respecting nature" on pages 114-121.

There are limitations to the extent to which we can mitigate these risks. 
We monitor the security situation, and liaise with host communities, 
governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote 
peaceful and safe operations for our people and local communities. 
We test the economic and operational resilience of our Nigerian 
projects against a wide range of assumptions and scenarios. We seek 
to proportionally share risks and funding commitments with joint-venture 
partners. When we participate in joint ventures in Nigeria, we require 
that they operate in accordance with good industry practice. Upon 
completion of the announced sale (subject to regulatory approvals and 
other conditions) of our onshore Nigeria business, our exposure to 
these risks are expected to reduce. Shell has other businesses in 
Nigeria that are outside the scope of the announced transaction.
See "Risk factors" on page 21.
We support the Nigerian government's efforts to improve the efficiency, 
functionality and domestic benefits of Nigeria's oil and gas industry. 
We report spills and how we respond to spills, including those that are 
caused by third-party interference. We implement a maintenance 
strategy to support sustainable equipment reliability and we have a 
multi-year programme to reduce routine flaring of associated gas.
See "Our Journey to net zero" on page 102.
Rest of Africa
Shell also has interests in Algeria, Mauritania, Namibia, São Tomé 
and Príncipe, South Africa and Tunisia.
In 2021, Shell announced plans to hand back upstream assets 
associated with the Miskar and Hasdrubal concessions to the 
government of Tunisia. In June 2022, Shell handed back the Miskar 
concession upon its expiry. Discussions continue regarding the 
Hasdrubal early relinquishment.
North America 
USA
The majority of our oil and gas interests in the USA comprise leases 
for federal offshore blocks in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
Such leases usually have a fixed primary term and, once production 
is established, remain in effect through continued production, subject 
to compliance with the relevant terms and provisions (including 
applicable laws and regulations).
In February 2023, we completed the sale of our 100% interest in Shell 
Onshore Ventures LLC, which held a 51.8% membership interest in Aera 
Energy LLC, an onshore production entity located in California.
Shell holds an interest in one licence in the North Slope area of Alaska. 
In 2020, we received regulatory approval to combine our near-shore 
leases in West Harrison Bay into a single unit. Shell is seeking a co-
owner to operate the unit.
Gulf of Mexico
Shell's major production area in the USA is the Gulf of Mexico. We 
have a total of 288 active federal offshore leases, where Shell is the 
operator, and 116 active federal offshore leases, where Shell has a 
non-operated interest.
We are the operator of nine production hubs: Mars (Shell interests 
33.7% to 100%), Olympus (Shell interests 71.5% to 100%), Auger 
(Shell interests 27.5% to 100%), Perdido (Shell interests 33.3% to 
40%), Ursa (Shell interests 45.4% to 100%), Enchilada/Salsa (Shell 
interests 37.5% to 75%), Appomattox (Shell interest 79%), Vito (Shell 
interest 63.1%), and Stones (Shell interest 100%). We also have an 
interest in the West Delta 143 offshore processing facilities (Shell 
interest 71.5%).
We continue to produce from the Coulomb field (Shell interest 100%) 
which ties into the Na Kika platform (Shell interest 50%) co-owned and 
operated by BP Exploration and Production Inc.
We continued exploration, development and decommissioning 
activities in the Gulf of Mexico in 2023.
In February 2023, we began production at Vito (Shell interest 63.1%), 
a Shell-operated production hub located approximately 10 miles (16 
kilometres) south of the Shell-operated Mars hub. Vito is expected to 
produce up to 100,000 boe/d.
In March 2023, we announced our FID for Dover (Shell interest 100%), 
a planned subsea tieback to the Shell-operated Appomattox (Shell 
interest 79%) production hub. Dover is expected to start production in 
late 2024/early 2025 and produce up to 21,000 boe/d.
In December 2023, FID was taken on the Sparta development (Shell 
interest 51%). This will be a Shell-operated production hub, which 
straddles four blocks of the Garden Banks area and replicates much 
of the Vito and Whale topsides design. The Sparta development is 
expected to reach first oil in 2028 and reach peak production of 
approximately 90,000 boe/d.
FID was also taken on the Perdido Phase 3 development, a planned 
subsea tieback campaign delivering three wells in the Great White 
unit to increase production at the Shell-operated Perdido spar (Shell 
interests 33.3% to 40%). After completion of this campaign in April 
2025, these wells collectively are expected to produce up to 
22,000 boe/d at peak production.
In 2023, we continued to build our Gulf of Mexico portfolio through 
inorganic growth, acquiring an additional 20% working interest in the 
Kaikias field (Shell interest now 100%). Kaikias is a subsea tieback to the 
Shell-operated Ursa production hub (Shell interests 45.4% to 100%).
In early 2024, the Whale production hub (Shell interest 60%) arrived at 
its offshore destination in the Alaminos Canyon area. Whale is expected 
to start production in late 2024 and reach a peak production of 
approximately 100,000 boe/d.
In February 2024, we began production at Rydberg (Shell interest 80%), 
a subsea tie-back to the Shell-operated Appomattox production hub 
(Shell interest 79%). Rydberg is expected to produce up to 14,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) at peak rates.

Simplified platforms lower costs 
and emissions in Gulf of Mexico 
Our oil and gas business is working to generate more 
value from our assets with less emissions, while providing the 
energy the world needs. In the US Gulf of Mexico, we are the 
leading operator and have one of the lowest greenhouse gas 
intensities in the world for producing oil, compared with those 
of other members of the International Association of Oil & 
Gas Producers. 
Our operated deep-water platform Vito (Shell interest 63.1%) 
started production in 2023. Vito is a third the size of its original 
design, which will reduce its emissions by around 80% over its 
operating life. We are using the same design concept for our 
operated Whale facility (Shell interest 60%), which is expected 
to start production in 2024.
In December 2023, we took the final investment decision to 
build the Sparta platform (Shell interest 51%), which will be our 
15th deep-water host in the Gulf of Mexico. Its design is based 
on decades of technical expertise and showcases our simplified 
approach to designing platforms. The Sparta development will 
be the first of Shell’s replicable projects to feature all-electric 
topsides equipment, significantly reducing GHG intensity and 
emissions. Sparta is expected to start production in 2028.

Shell has interests in the onshore Vaca Muerta Basin in the Neuquén 
Province. We are the operator of the Cruz de Lorena, Sierras Blancas, 
Coiron Amargo Sur Oeste (Shell interest 90% each), and Bajada de 
Añelo (Shell interest 50%) areas. We have non-operated interests in the 
areas of Rincon La Ceniza and La Escalonada (Shell interest 45% each), 
both operated by Total Austral S.A., and in the Bandurria Sur area (Shell 
interest 30%), operated by YPF S.A. We are the administrator in a joint 
property agreement that regulates the operation of the pipeline (Shell 
interest 60%) which connects Sierras Blancas and the regional 
distribution network. Shell has a participating interest in an oil pipeline 
located in the northern area of the basin which connects to the Pacific 
Evacuation Route (Shell interest 13.3%), operated by YPF S.A.
In the north-western Argentina basin, we have a non-operated interest 
in the onshore Acambuco area (Shell interest 22.5%), operated by Pan 
American Energy.
In addition to the producing interests, we are the operator of two 
frontier exploration blocks offshore Argentina (Shell interest 60% each) 
and we have a non-operated interest in an adjacent block (Shell 
interest 30%), operated by Equinor.

Proved reserves
Before taking production into account, our proved reserves increased by 
1,274 million boe in 2023. This consisted of an increase of 944 million 
boe from Shell subsidiaries and an increase of 330 million boe from the 
Shell share of joint ventures and associates. After taking production into 
account, our proved reserves increased by 209 million boe in 2023 to 
9,787 million boe at December 31, 2023.
Shell subsidiaries
Before taking production into account, Shell subsidiaries' proved 
reserves increased by 944 million boe in 2023. This consisted of an 
increase of 408 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, 
an increase of 490 million boe (2,841 thousand million scf) of natural 
gas and an increase of 46 million barrels of synthetic crude oil. The 
944 million boe increase comprised a net increase of 909 million boe 
from revisions and reclassifications, an increase of 155 million boe from 
extensions and discoveries, an increase of 3 million boe from improved 
recovery and a net decrease of 123 million boe related to purchases 
and sales of minerals in place.
After taking into account production of 978 million boe (of which 41 
million boe were consumed in operations), Shell subsidiaries' proved 
reserves decreased by 34 million boe in 2023 to 8,283 million boe. 
In 2023, Shell subsidiaries' proved developed reserves (PD) increased 
by 100 million boe to 6,321 million boe and proved undeveloped 
reserves (PUD) decreased by 134 million boe to 1,962 million boe.
Shell share of joint ventures and associates
Before taking production into account, the Shell share of joint 
ventures and associates' proved reserves increased by 330 million 
boe in 2023. This consisted of an increase of 78 million barrels of 
crude oil and natural gas liquids, and an increase of 252 million 
boe (1,462 thousand million scf) of natural gas. The 330 million boe 
increase comprises a net increase of 346 million boe from purchase 
of minerals in place, an increase of 5 million boe from extensions 
and discoveries, and a net decrease of 21 million boe from 
revisions and reclassifications.
After taking into account production of 87 million boe (of which 5 
million boe were consumed in operations), the Shell share of joint 
ventures and associates' proved reserves increased by 243 million 
boe to 1,504 million boe at December 31, 2023.
The Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PD decreased by 
100 million boe to 508 million boe, and PUD increased by 343 million 
boe to 996 million boe.
See "Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited)" on pages 291-309 for more 
information about proved oil and gas reserves of Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share of 
the proved oil and gas reserves of joint ventures and associates.
Proved undeveloped reserves
In 2023, Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share of joint ventures and 
associates' PUD increased by 209 million boe to 2,958 million boe. 
There were decreases of 494 million boe as a result of maturation to 
PD, mainly 81 million boe in Mabrouk North-East (Oman), 77 million 
boe in Vito (USA), 74 million boe in Gorgon (Australia) and 262 
million boe spread across other fields. These were offset by an increase 
of 47 million due to de-maturation of PD to PUD, an increase of 146 
million boe as a result of revisions, reclassifications and entitlement 
changes, a net increase of 347 million boe due to purchases and sales 
of minerals in place, a net increase of 160 million boe due to extensions 
and discoveries, mainly due to 57 million boe in Sparta (USA), 39 
million boe in Groundbirch (Canada), and 64 million boe spread 
across other fields, and an increase of 3 million boe due to 
improved recovery.
In addition to the maturation of 494 million boe from PUD to PD, 
90 million boe was matured to PD as through PUD as a result of 
project execution during the year.
PUD held for five years or more (PUD5+) on December 31, 2023, 
amounted to 212 million boe, an increase of 56 million boe compared 
with the end of 2022. The increase in PUD5+ during 2023 was driven 
mainly by changes in Assa North (Nigeria) and Gbaran (Nigeria).
The fields with the largest PUD5+ on December 31, 2023, were Assa 
North (Nigeria) and Tupi (Brazil). These PUD5+ remain undeveloped 
because of delays in drilling operations and security incidents (Nigeria) 
or because of ongoing development involving a large number of deep-
water wells (Brazil).
During 2023, we spent $7.2 billion on development activities related 
to PUD maturation. 
Delivery commitments
We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under 
a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit 
us to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, 
although some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed 
and determinable quantities, as discussed below.
In the past three years, we met our contractual delivery commitments, 
with the notable exceptions of Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, and 
Malaysia. The delivery commitments for Egypt and Trinidad and 
Tobago have been renegotiated. In the period 2024-2026, we are 
contractually committed to deliver to third parties, joint ventures and 
associates a total of some 5,380 billion scf of natural gas from our 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. The sales contracts contain 
a mixture of fixed and variable pricing formulae that are generally 
referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or 
other petroleum products at the time of delivery. 
In the period 2024-2026, we expect to meet our delivery commitments 
for almost all the areas in which they are carried, with an estimated 
70% coming from PD, 5% through the delivery of gas that becomes 
available to us from paying royalties in cash, and 25% from the 
development of PUD as well as other new projects and purchases. 
The key exception is: 
￮ In Malaysia, a the third-party gas supply line under maintenance was 
not repaired in 2023. Force majeure has been declared, and no 
penalties have been incurred, resulting in an expected true shortfall 
of some 68 billion scf of gas (62% of the promised gas delivery).

Exploration
Shell continues to explore for and mature hydrocarbons across our 
Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses. Exploration may result in 
discoveries of oil and gas that we can develop, helping maintain 
energy security and contributing to our strategy.
We use our subsurface, project and technical expertise, and actively 
manage non-technical risks across a diversified portfolio of opportunities 
and projects. This involves adopting an integrated approach for all 
stages, from basin choice to development. We use competitive 
techniques and benchmark our approach internally and externally.
In 2023, hydrocarbons were found in the UK, the Gulf of Mexico, 
Brazil, Namibia, Brunei, Egypt, Colombia and Oman.
UK
In 2023, Shell farmed into two BP-operated exploration licences in the 
West of Shetlands area, acquiring a 33.33% non-operated interest. 
We were also awarded nine licences as part of the 33rd Offshore 
Licensing Round, two of which are pending government approval 
(Shell-operated interests 55.5% to 100%). Additionally we relinquished 
four operated and two non-operated exploration licences across the 
UK Continental Shelf (Shell interests 40% to 100%).
Brunei
In 2023, the exploration acreage that formed part of Block CA1 
was relinquished.
Malaysia
In 2023, Shell signed two exploration PSCs, one for an offshore 
Sarawak block (Shell interest 45%, operator) and one for a Sabah 
ultra-deep-water block (Shell interest 40%, non-operated).

Business conditions
For the business conditions relevant to Marketing, see "Market 
overview" on pages 36-38.
Marketing sales 
In 2023, Marketing sales volumes were 2% higher than in 2022, 
mainly as a result of improved demand from aviation.
Earnings 2023-2022
Segment earnings in 2023 were 38% higher than in 2022, reflecting 
higher Marketing margins (increase of $1,465 million), including higher 
unit margins in Mobility; higher margins in Lubricants because of lower 
feedstock costs; and higher volumes in Sectors and Decarbonisation. 
These increases were partly offset by higher operating expenses 
(increase of $703 million) and higher depreciation charges 
(increase of $264 million), mainly due to asset acquisitions.
Segment earnings in 2023 included impairment charges of 
$457 million and charges of $111 million related to redundancy and 
restructuring partly offset by gains of $298 million, related to indirect 
tax credits. These charges and gains are part of identified items and 
compare with 2022, which included net impairment charges and 
reversals of $321 million; net losses of $135 million related to the 
sale of assets; and provisions for onerous contracts of $62 million.
Adjusted Earnings increased by $426 million compared with 2022, 
as a result of the following: 
￮ Mobility Adjusted Earnings were $53 million lower, mainly as a 
result of higher operating expenses and higher depreciation. This 
was partly offset by better margins. 
￮ Lubricants Adjusted Earnings were $339 million higher, mainly 
because of higher margins due to lower feedstock costs.
￮ Sectors and Decarbonisation Adjusted Earnings were $141 million 
higher, mainly because of increased volumes and higher earnings 
in joint ventures.
Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 61) and Form 
20-F (page 65) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by Adjusted 
EBITDA; working capital inflows of $873 million; and the timing impact 
of payments, relating to emission certificates and biofuel programmes 
of $296 million. These inflows were partly offset by tax payments 
of $744 million and non-cash cost-of-sales (CCS) adjustments of 
$221 million.
Cash capital expenditure 
Cash capital expenditure in 2023 reflected $3.3 billion in low-carbon 
energy solutions, compared with $1.4 billion in 2022. 
Cash capital expenditure in low-carbon energy solutions was 136% 
higher than in 2022, mainly due to the acquisition of Nature Energy 
and the expansion of our Mobility electric vehicle charging business. 
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 93.
Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be around $3 billion 
in 2024.
Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business development:
￮ In February 2023, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the 
shares of Nature Energy Biogas A/S for nearly $2 billion. This 
supports our ambitions to build an integrated renewable natural 
gas (RNG) value chain at global scale.

Our largest electric vehicle charging 
station opens in Shenzhen
We opened our largest electric vehicle (EV) charging station 
globally in Shenzhen, China, in September 2023. The Shell 
Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station is designed to serve 
thousands of drivers every day with 258 fast-charging points 
in one of the country's major economic and technology hubs. 
China is one of the most important growth markets for Shell 
Mobility and will play a key role in Shell's electric vehicle 
charging strategy which is to continue building the infrastructure 
needed to meet our customers' future demand for charging. 
Globally, we are focusing on public charging and we expect 
to increase our charge points to around 200,000 by 2030.
The Shenzhen charging station -- operated by Shell and BYD 
Electric Vehicle Investment Company Limited, a joint venture 
between Shell and Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD -- 
served more than 3,300 electric vehicles a day during its trial 
operation. 
The rooftop solar panels installed at the Shenzhen station have 
the capacity to generate about 300,000 kilowatt-hours of 
renewable electricity per year, and this would be available to 
charge customers' vehicles. In addition to charging, the station 
also offers convenience retailing, food and beverages, and a 
drivers' lounge. 
Through joint ventures and wholly owned enterprises, Shell in 
China operates a retailing network of around 2,000 fuel stations 
and an electric vehicle charging network of 25,000 public 
charge points. The utilisation rate of our electric vehicle chargers 
in all of China was around 25% in 2023, which is two-and-a-half 
times the industry average.
Shell offers products and services to meet the different energy 
and mobility needs of drivers. In September 2023, we opened 
the Panlong Integrated Energy Station in Wuhan. This station 
offers petrol and diesel, charging and hydrogen refuelling.

Business and property
Mobility
Shell is one of the world's largest mobility retailers by number of 
sites, with more than 47,000 Shell-branded mobility locations in 
more than 80 markets at the end of 2023. We operate different 
models across these markets, from full ownership of sites to brand 
licensing agreements. As we aim to high-grade our network, we plan 
to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) 
each year until 2025.
Every day, around 33 million retail customers visit our mobility locations 
for a range of quality fuels, electric vehicle charging, and convenience 
and non-fuel products and services. Through Shell Fleet Solutions, our 
business customers can obtain fuel cards, road services and carbon-
offset offers, among other products and services. 
We are expanding our convenience and non-fuel retail offer to cater to 
our customers' needs. At many of our sites, we offer convenience items, 
including beverages and fresh food, and services such as lubricant 
changes and car washes. At the end of 2023, Shell operated 13,000 
convenience stores worldwide. We have upgraded close to 2,000 
stores with our Shell Café premium fresh coffee and food offer since 
launching in 2021.
Shell Mobility aims to take a leadership position in the energy 
transition by marketing more and cleaner fuels for our customers, 
focusing on growing our presence in key markets like China, Europe 
and the USA. To support this, we acquired Volta Inc. in 2023 and now 
own and operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging 
networks in the USA. At the end of 2023, Shell had around 54,000 
public charge points globally at Shell forecourts, on-street locations, 
mobility hubs and other sites, such as supermarkets. 
Shell opened its largest electric vehicle charging station in the world 
in Shenzhen, China, with 258 public fast-charging points.
As we work to provide more low-carbon alternatives to our customers, 
we continue to develop traditional fuels for drivers of internal 
combustion engine vehicles. Aided by our partnership with Scuderia 
Ferrari, we have concentrated on developing fuels with special 
formulations designed to clean engines and improve performance. 
We sold fuels under the Shell V-Power brand in 68 markets in 2023. 
Shell Commercial Road Transport (CRT) provides fuels, lubricants and 
digital services to customers with heavy-duty vehicles in their fleets. 
In 2023, Shell opened its first public electric vehicle charging facility 
for trucks in Hamburg, Germany. This consists of four fast-charging 
stations, and multiple eDepot solutions, which provide charging 
facilities at customer sites. 
We also offer drivers using heavy-duty LNG-fuelled trucks access to 
operated and partner networks in Europe. In 2023 we opened our 
first LNG refuelling sites in Austria and Hungary.

In Germany, Shell is building a bioLNG liquefaction plant at Shell's 
Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland. This liquefaction plant will 
supply the German market with bioLNG from 2024 and will help 
our CRT customers decarbonise their operations. Since 2022, 
Shell's customers in the Netherlands have been able to receive 
a bioLNG blend.
Lubricants
Shell Lubricants has been the number one global finished lubricants 
supplier in terms of market share for 17 consecutive years, according 
to Kline & Company data for 2022. Shell lubricants are available 
across more than 160 markets for passenger cars, motorcycles, 
trucks, coaches, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, 
power generation, agriculture and construction. 
We also make premium lubricants for conventional vehicles and Shell
E-fluids for electric vehicles using gas-to-liquids (GTL) base oils that are 
made from natural gas at our Pearl GTL plant in Qatar.
See "Integrated Gas" on page 44. 
Our global lubricants supply chain has a network of 32 lubricants 
blending plants, four base oil plants (one of which we operate), 
10 grease plants and six GTL base oil storage hubs.
During 2023, we completed the acquisition from M&I Materials 
Development Limited of the MIDEL premium product range of ester-
based dielectric transformer fluids, which provide a differentiated 
position in Transformer Oils. These oils are used in power distribution, 
offshore wind parks, utility companies and traction power systems. We 
also acquired the MIVOLT brand of dielectric fluids for the direct 
immersion cooling of battery systems and power electronics. MIVOLT's 
ester-based immersion cooling fluids support the development of 
thermally efficient electric vehicle batteries, battery storage systems 
and data centres.
Sectors and Decarbonisation
Sectors and Decarbonisation sells fuels, speciality products and 
services, including low-carbon energy solutions, to a broad range 
of commercial customers, including in the aviation, marine 
and agricultural sectors. 
Shell Aviation provides aviation fuel, lubricants and low-carbon 
solutions globally. In May 2023, Shell announced a multi-year offtake 
agreement for sustainable aviation fuel with Montana Renewables, 
one of the largest sustainable aviation fuel producers in North America. 
In 2022, Shell launched Avelia, one of the world's first blockchain-
powered digital sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) book-and-claim 
solutions for business travel. Since then, customers – including Google, 
Bank of America and Yokogawa – have joined the platform. Avelia is 
designed to help trigger demand for SAF, encouraging investment in 
production, which could lower the price point for these fuels.
Shell Marine offers customers marine fuels and lubricants, as well 
as low-carbon solutions, and has a supply network that covers key 
bunkering locations around the world. Through our marine activities, 
we primarily provide the shipping and maritime sectors with lubricants, 
and we provide fuels, chemical products, and related technical and 
digital services. We supply more than 300 grades of lubricants and 
seven types of fuel to vessels worldwide, ranging from ocean-going 
tankers to fishing boats. Shell Marine lubricant products are used in 
around 10,000 vessels and are available in more than 700 ports 
across more than 60 countries. 
Shell Bitumen supplies customers across 60 markets and provides 
enough bitumen to resurface 500 kilometres of road lanes every 
day. It also invests in research and development to create 
innovative products, such as bitumen that can help reduce the 
impact of asphalt production and paving on local air quality.
Shell Sulphur Solutions manages the value chain of sulphur from 
refining to marketing. It provides sulphur for use in applications, 
such as fertiliser, mining and chemicals. It also licenses Shell Thiogro 
technologies to create sulphur-enhanced fertilisers. 
Shell and the non-operated joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 44%) 
are, together, one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of 
biofuels. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels (2022: 9.5 billion 
litres) went into Shell's sale of fuels worldwide, which includes the Shell 
share of sales made by Raízen. In addition, in 2023, Raízen produced, 
on a 100% basis, around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol (2022: 3 billion 
litres) and around 5.8 million tonnes of sugar from sugar cane (2022: 
4.8 million tonnes). The cellulosic ethanol plant at Raízen's Costa 
Pinto mill in Brazil produced 30 million litres of second-generation 
ethanol in 2023 (2022: 26 million litres). The majority of the ethanol 
and cellulosic ethanol produced by Raízen is sold unblended to 
international customers in markets such as the USA, Europe and Japan.
RNG, also known as biogas or biomethane, is gas derived from 
processing organic waste in a controlled environment until it is fully 
interchangeable with conventional natural gas. 
In February 2023, Shell completed the acquisition of Nature Energy, 
one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe. This acquisition 
supports our ambitions to build an integrated RNG value chain at 
global scale as we seek to profitably grow our low-carbon offerings 
across multiple sectors. Shell aims to generate additional value 
from our trading and supply chain. Together with its partners, Nature 
Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one in 
the Netherlands.
Shell is constructing two facilities which will convert dairy manure 
to RNG and which will be located at the Bettencourt Dairies in 
Wendell, Idaho, USA. Shell Downstream Bovarius is expected to 
produce around 400,000 MMBtu a year of negative-carbon-intensity 
RNG. The second facility, Shell Downstream Friesian, is expected to 
produce around 350,000 MMBtu a year of negative-carbon-intensity 
RNG using cow manure from the dairy once operational. Both facilities 
are expected to be operational in 2024.

Business conditions 
For the business conditions relevant to Chemicals and Products, 
see "Market overview" on pages 36-38.
Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation 
Utilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a percentage 
of the rated capacity. Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation was 
11 percentage points lower than in 2022, mainly due to planned and 
unplanned maintenance.
Refinery utilisation
Utilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a 
percentage of the rated capacity. Refinery utilisation was in line 
with 2022.
Chemicals and Products sales
Chemicals sales volumes were 8% lower than in 2022, mainly because 
of lower demand driven by oversupply and a weak economic outlook.
Refining & Trading sales volumes were 8% lower than in 2022 due to 
lower Trading sales volumes in the USA and Asia.
Earnings 2023-2022
Segment earnings in 2023 were 66% lower than in 2022, reflecting 
lower Products margins (decrease of $1,528 million), mainly driven 
by lower refining margins and partly offset by higher margins from 
trading and optimisation. The segment earnings also reflected higher 
depreciation charges (increase of $546 million) due to the start-up of 
operations at Shell Polymers Monaca in the USA. These losses were 
partly offset by higher Chemicals margins (increase of $612 million).
Segment earnings in 2023 included the following: 
￮ net impairment charges and reversals of $2,204 million, mainly 
related to the Chemicals assets in Singapore;
￮ charges of $84 million related to redundancy and restructuring; 
partly offset by favourable movements of $213 million related 
to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
These charges and gains are part of identified items and compare 
with 2022, which included:
￮ net impairment charges and reversals of $226 million; 
￮ legal provisions of $149 million;
￮ unfavourable movements of $147 million related to the fair value 
accounting of commodity derivatives;
￮ tax charges relating to the EU solidarity contribution of $74 million; 
partly offset by gains of $223 million, related to the sale of assets; 
and
￮ gains of $104 million, related to the remeasurement of redundancy 
and restructuring costs.
In 2023, Adjusted Earnings from Chemicals accounted for (44)%, 
Refining for 66% and Trading and Supply for 78%. The decrease in 
Adjusted Earnings of $1,029 million was driven by the following:
￮ Products Adjusted Earnings were $778 million lower than in 2022, 
mainly driven by lower refining and oil sands margins and partly 
offset by higher margins from Trading & Optimisation.
￮ Chemicals negative Adjusted Earnings were $251 million more than
in 2022, mainly because of higher depreciation and operating 
expenses, partly offset by higher margins and Income from 
associates.
Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 66) and Form 
20-F (page 70) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by Adjusted 
EBITDA, working capital inflows of $609 million, cash inflows relating 
to commodity derivatives of $529 million, and dividends (net of profits) 
from joint ventures and associates of $300 million. These inflows 
were partly offset by the timing impact of payments relating to 
emission certificates and biofuel programmes of $1,224 million,
non-cash cost-of-sales (CCS) adjustments of $627 million, and 
tax payments of $484 million.

Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure decreased by $0.6 billion in 2023 mainly 
because of the completion of construction of our cracker facilities 
in Pennsylvania, USA, in 2022. Our cash capital expenditure is 
expected to be in the range of $3-4 billion in 2024.
Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business developments:
￮ In November 2022, we commenced operations of our Pennsylvania 
Chemical project, Shell Polymers Monaca (SPM). The facility was 
not fully functional during 2023 due to operational and start-up 
challenges.
￮ In June 2023, Shell announced its intention to conduct a strategic 
review of energy and chemicals assets on Bukom and Jurong Island 
in Singapore.
￮ In January 2024, we announced the final investment decision to 
convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and 
Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany into a production unit for 
Group III base oils.
Business and property
Chemicals
Our plants produce a range of base chemicals, including ethylene, 
propylene and aromatics, and intermediate chemicals, such as styrene 
monomer, propylene oxide, solvents, detergent alcohols, ethylene 
oxide and ethylene glycol. We have the capacity to produce around 
8.1 million tonnes of ethylene a year (including the Shell share of 
capacity entitlement (offtake rights) of joint ventures and associates, 
which may be different from nominal equity interest). Our Pennsylvania 
Chemical project, SPM, which commenced operations in November 
2022, was not fully functional during 2023 due to operational and 
start-up challenges. The facility ramped up to full operation during the 
first quarter of 2024. We are expanding our product portfolio to 
include sustainable chemicals made from bio-based and circular 
feedstocks, and more intermediates and performance chemicals, such 
as polyethylene and polycarbonate. We operate chemical plants 
worldwide and have a balance of locations, feedstocks and products.
In addition to our stand-alone, chemicals-only production sites, we 
are repurposing our refineries into energy and chemicals parks. This 
is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. We continue to explore 
options for the former Convent Refinery in Louisiana, USA, which has 
been shut down. The energy and chemicals parks are expected to 
focus more on meeting customers' low-carbon and sustainability needs.
In 2023, we supplied more than 11 million tonnes of petrochemicals 
to more than 1,000 industrial customers. Products made from chemicals 
are used in everyday life, including in medical equipment, construction, 
transport, electronics, agriculture and sports.
Products – Refining & Trading
Refining
We have interests in eight refineries worldwide, with a capacity to 
process a total of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil a day. The distribution 
of our refining capacity is 60% in Europe, 26% in the Americas and 
14% in Asia.
We continue to evaluate ways to high-grade our refining portfolio 
to meet our strategic aims and to capitalise on the strong integration 
between our customers, trading operations and chemical plants. 
We are repurposing our refining sites into energy and chemicals parks. 
This will mean developing new facilities or converting existing units to 
support low-carbon products, while dismantling existing units that do 
not deliver sustainable long-term value. We initiated a strategic review 
of our Bukom and Jurong Island assets in Singapore.
We announced the final investment decision to convert the 
hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals 
Park Rheinland in Germany into a production unit for Group III base 
oils. These mineral base oils have a very high viscosity index and are 
produced with hydrocracking technology. The market for high-quality 
engine and transmission oils, as well as e-fluids and cooling fluids, 
some of which are made from these oils, is expected to grow. Crude 
oil processing will end at the Wesseling site by 2025 but continue 
at the Godorf site.
Trading and Supply
Through our main trading offices in London, Houston, Singapore 
and Rotterdam, we trade crude oil, low-carbon fuels, refined 
products, chemical feedstocks and environmental products. Trading 
and Supply trades in physical and financial contracts, lease storage 
and transportation capacities, and manages global shipping and 
wholesale commercial fuel activities. 
Operating in around 25 countries, with about 180 Shell and joint-
venture (including pipeline) terminals, we believe our supply and 
distribution infrastructure is well positioned to make deliveries 
around the world. 
Shipping and Maritime enables the safe delivery of the Shell Trading 
and Supply contracts. This includes supplying feedstocks for our 
refineries and chemical plants, and finished products such as gasoline, 
diesel and aviation fuel to our Marketing segment and customers. 
Shell Wholesale Commercial Fuels provides fuels for transport, 
industry and heating. These range from reliable main-grade fuels 
to premium products. 
Pipelines
We own and operate eight tank farms across the USA through 
Shell Pipeline Company LP (Shell interest 100%). It transports around 
1.5 billion barrels of crude oil, refined products and chemicals a year 
through around 6,000 kilometres of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico 
and nine US states. Our non-operated ownership interests 
provide another 13,000 kilometres of pipeline.
We carry more than 40 types of crude oil and more than 20 grades 
of fuel and chemicals, including gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, 
chemicals and ethylene.
We own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream 
and logistics assets. Our assets include interests in entities that own 
crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as 
key infrastructure to:
￮ transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to US Gulf 
Coast and Midwest refining markets; and 
￮ deliver refined products from those markets to major demand 
centres.
Our assets also include interests in entities that own natural gas and 
refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market hubs 
and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical sites 
along the US Gulf Coast.

Oil Sands
Synthetic crude oil is produced by mining bitumen-saturated sands, 
extracting the bitumen and transporting it to a processing facility where 
hydrogen is added to make a wide range of feedstocks for refineries. 
The Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) in Alberta, Canada, includes 
the Albian Sands mining and extraction operations, the Scotford 
upgrader and the Quest CCS project.
We have a 50% interest in 1745844 Alberta Ltd. (formerly known 
as Marathon Oil Canada Corporation), which holds a 20% interest 
in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project.

Wind and hydrogen for decarbonisation in Rotterdam
We are aiming for more value with less emissions by working to 
integrate our assets and projects. Take our investment in Holland 
Hydrogen 1 (HH1), for example. HH1 will be one of Europe's largest 
renewable hydrogen facilities when it is operational in the middle 
of the decade.
Construction of the 200 MW electrolyser facility HH1 began at the 
end of 2022. HH1 is designed to produce up to 80,000 kilograms 
of renewable hydrogen per day and will be powered by the 
Hollandse Kust Noord wind farm, operated by the CrossWind 
joint venture (Shell interest 79.9%) with Eneco. HH1 will supply 
hydrogen to the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, 
which will use it to partially decarbonise its production of petrol, 
diesel and jet fuel.
In June 2023, Hollandse Kust Noord, which lies 18.5 kilometres 
off the west coast of the Netherlands, produced its first electricity. 
Hollandse Kust Noord has been operational since December 2023 
with an installed capacity of 759 MW, generating at least 3.3 TWh 
per year. CrossWind is exploring the use of innovative technologies, 
including artificial intelligence (AI), to help ensure a continuous 
supply of electricity, even when there is no wind. 
HH1 is energy transition being put into action where we are 
leveraging our expertise across the value chain to produce 
renewable hydrogen which will be used to decarbonise our 
own energy products and, when the hydrogen market develops, 
potentially supply other customers.
Photo: Final installation of the Hollandse Kust Noord wind park, located 18.5 kilometres off the coast of Egmond aan Zee. The wind farm was built by CrossWind, a joint venture between 
Shell and Eneco.

Solutions, see "Market overview" on pages 36-38.
External power sales
In 2023, our external power sales increased compared with 2022 
as a result of organic customer growth across the portfolio and 
portfolio additions.
Sales of pipeline gas to end-use customers
In 2023, the decrease in our sales of pipeline gas to end-use customers 
was mainly driven by commercial decisions to reduce our supply to 
certain counterparties.
Earnings 2023-2022 [A]
Segment earnings reflected lower margins (decrease of $684 million), 
mainly from trading and optimisation. This was because of lower gas 
and power price volatility in 2023, unfavourable tax movements 
(decrease of $218 million) and higher operating expenses, resulting 
from business growth (increase of $186 million).
Segment earnings also included favourable movements of $2,756 million, 
due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, partly offset by 
net impairment charges and reversals of $669 million. These favourable 
movements and charges are part of identified items and compare with 
2022 which included unfavourable movements of $2,443 million due 
to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, and impairment 
charges of $361 million. 
In 2023, Adjusted Earnings from Energy Marketing and Trading and 
Optimisation accounted for 216% of Renewables and Energy Solutions 
Adjusted Earnings. This was partially offset by Renewable Power 
Generation, Hydrogen, CCS, NBS and Shell Ventures that accounted 
for a negative 116%. 
Prior year earnings summary [A]
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 74) and Form 
20-F (page 78) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
[A] All earnings amounts are shown post-tax, unless stated otherwise. 2022-2021 reported 
pre-tax segment figures.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by working 
capital inflows of $3,723 million and Adjusted EBITDA. This was partly 
offset by net cash outflows, related to derivatives of $1,988 million and 
tax payments of $762 million.
Cash capital expenditure
Within cash capital expenditure, $2.3 billion was in low-carbon energy 
solutions. This includes Renewable Power Generation, Environmental 
Solutions, Hydrogen and CCS. In 2022, cash capital expenditure 
included $2.9 billion in low-carbon energy solutions. Higher cash 
capital expenditure in 2022 was mainly a result of the acquisition 
of the renewable energy platform Sprng Energy group. 
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 93.
Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be in the range
of $4-5 billion in 2024. 
Portfolio and business development
Key portfolio and business developments: 
￮ In March 2023, we entered into a joint venture with Eku Energy 
(Shell interest 45%) to deliver a utility-scale battery energy storage 
system in Australia. 
￮ In June 2023, Hollandse Kust Noord, our offshore wind park in the 
Netherlands (Shell interest 79.9%), delivered its first megawatt hours 
of electricity. 
￮ In November 2023, we sold our home energy businesses in the UK 
and Germany to Octopus Energy Group. 
Business and property
We are building a business to profitably deliver clean energy for our 
customers.
Energy Marketing
We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, 
commercial and industrial customers. We do this through direct 
electricity sales, storage solutions and energy optimisation services. 
Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are 
Australia and the USA. In Australia, we are one of the largest 
commercial and industrial retailers of electricity in the market.
We entered into a joint venture with Eku Energy to deliver a utility-scale 
battery energy storage system in Australia. With this system, Shell will 
have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year 
period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024.

---- Page 76 ----
In November 2023, we divested our retail businesses in the UK and 
Germany to Octopus Energy, and we are winding down the business in 
the Netherlands. We continue to sell natural gas and power to retail 
customers in the USA and Australia.
Trading and Optimisation
We trade and optimise power and pipeline gas, and carbon credits 
from our own assets and from third parties. We work in partnership 
with Shell businesses across the regions to offer energy solutions that 
can help our customers decarbonise. We have a gas and power 
trading presence in key markets, including North America and Europe.
Renewable Power Generation
We enable renewable power generation by owning and operating 
wind farms and solar plants, and participating in joint ventures. We 
target selective growth in markets where there is integration potential. 
In the USA, Shell's Brazos Wind Farm achieved its first power following 
the dismantling and refurbishing of existing wind turbines and the 
commissioning of new ones. In December 2023, we strategically sold 
60% of our interest in Brazos to InfraRed Capital Partners to release 
capital for investment in other renewables projects. Shell will retain 
100% of the power offtake. 
In June 2023, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind development 
within the CrossWind joint venture (Shell interest 79.9%) reached a 
significant milestone by producing its first megawatts of renewable 
electricity. The electricity from this wind farm is planned to supply the 
200 MW electrolyser Holland Hydrogen 1 (Shell interest 100%) in the 
Netherlands as it comes on line. 
At the end of 2023, our share of renewable power generation capacity 
was 2.5 GW in operation and 4.1 GW in development. Our renewable 
power capacities are listed below:

Hydrogen 
Hydrogen can help to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, such as 
heavy industry and heavy-duty transport, as well as decarbonise our 
own assets. We are part of joint ventures and alliances that have built 
electrolysers and hydrogen filling stations. We have also participated 
in feasibility studies that aim to show the viability of a global import 
and export market for hydrogen. We aim to develop opportunities 
where we see adjacencies with our integrated business and pathways 
to attractive returns. 
Since 2021, we have operated an electrolyser (Shell interest 100%) in 
Germany, which produces hydrogen using electricity from renewable 
sources. In July 2022, we announced the final investment decision to 
build Holland Hydrogen 1 to produce renewable hydrogen. 
Carbon capture and storage
CCS is a combination of technologies that capture and store CO2 deep 
underground, preventing its release into the atmosphere. R&ES offers 
CCS services to our customers. We report existing CCS operations that 
help decarbonise our own assets in the segment where the relevant 
asset sits.
We have a 33.3% interest in the Northern Lights Joint Venture, where 
the other partners are Equinor and TotalEnergies (equal partners). The 
project is in Norway and is under construction. Phase One is expected 
to be ready for start-up in 2025. In 2023, the Northern Lights CCS joint 
venture signed agreements with both Yara International and Ørsted for 
the transport and permanent storage of CO2, marking an important 
step in helping to create a commercial market for CCS in Europe.
Nature and Environmental Solutions
Nature and Environmental Solutions include our NBS business and the 
Environmental Products Trading Business (EPTB). NBS invests in projects 
that conserve, enhance and restore ecosystems – such as forests, 
grasslands and wetlands – to prevent GHG emissions or reduce 
atmospheric CO2 levels. 
Through EPTB we develop, source offtake, trade and supply 
environmental products across compliance and voluntary markets. 
This includes working with our other businesses such as Integrated Gas 
or Marketing to provide integrated energy solutions to customers.
Shell Ventures
Shell Ventures are corporate venture funds where we act as an investor 
and a partner to start-ups and businesses to accelerate the energy and 
mobility transformation. We invest in companies that work on solutions 
to lower emissions, electrify energy systems, gain data-based insights 
and provide innovative consumer solutions.
Investments
Within R&ES, we maintain an integrated business model, with 
trading and optimisation, to help us manage our value delivery. Our 
investments are subject to financial modelling and stress-testing, due 
diligence and risk assessments to ensure that our capital is allocated 
to the most attractive low-carbon projects and opportunities. We 
monitor and evaluate the performance of our acquisitions against our 
expectations. Some acquired companies in new business sectors are 
not yet in full compliance with our Binding Corporate Rules. Following 
assessments of each new acquisition, specific actions are put in place 
to achieve compliance with our Binding Corporate Rules.

Brazos windfarm 
upgrade and 
first power
Shell's upgraded Brazos Wind Farm produced its first power in 
2023. This was achieved after we decommissioned and restored a 
legacy wind farm at the end of its useful life and "repowered" it by 
building newer, more efficient turbines on the same acreage of land.
Brazos is expected to generate 182 megawatts, which will be 
put into the Texas electricity grid. From there, it is used for both 
residential and commercial needs. The energy that Brazos 
generates is enough to power more than 50,000 households. 
We are recycling the decommissioned turbine blades to be 
used as a component in concrete.
In December, we sold 60% of our interest in Brazos to InfraRed 
Capital Partners, releasing capital for investment in other 
renewables projects. Shell will retain 100% of the power offtake. 
The Brazos wind farm in Texas, USA is an example of an investment 
which is bringing more green electricity to the grid today. It is also 
a demonstration of capital discipline in our power investments 
where during development or upon achieving operations, we may 
choose to sell a share of the project to a third party to release 
capital to be used in the next renewable generation project. 
This allows us to make further investments in the energy transition, 
as we transform to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.
Harnessing wind power is a vital part of the energy transition and 
there has been unprecedented global growth over the past 12 
months. At COP28, countries agreed to triple capacity by 2030. 
Photo: Brazos wind farm is located in Fluvanna, Texas, 112 kilometres (70 miles) south-east of Lubbock, on the Caprock of the Llano Estacado.

Overview
All finance expense, income and related taxes are included 
in Corporate segment earnings rather than the business 
segment earnings. 
The holdings and treasury organisation manages many of the 
Corporate entities. It is the point of contact between Shell and 
external capital markets, conducting a range of transactions, such as 
raising debt instruments and conducting foreign exchange transactions. 
Treasury centres in London and Singapore support these activities. 
Headquarters and central functions provide business support in 
communications, finance, health, human resources, information 
technology (IT), legal services, real estate and security. They also 
provide support for shareholder-related activities. The central functions 
are supported by business service centres, which process transactions, 
manage data and produce statutory returns, among other services. 
Most headquarters and central-function costs are recovered from 
the business segments. Costs that are not recovered are retained 
in Corporate. 
Earnings 2023-2022
An increase in the negative segment earnings was mainly driven 
by unfavourable movements in currency exchange rate effects 
and tax credits.
Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2022, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2021, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 77) and Form 
20-F (page 81) for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with 
the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities decreased primarily due to 
unfavourable working capital movements.
Self-insurance
We mainly self-insure our hazard risk exposures. We continually assess 
the safety performance of our operations and make risk mitigation 
recommendations, where relevant, to keep the risk of an accident as 
low as possible. Our insurance companies are adequately capitalised 
and they may transfer risks to third-party insurers where economical, 
effective and relevant.

Other central activities
Information technology and cyber security 
Digitalisation is a key success factor in delivering Shell's Powering 
Progress strategy. Shell is transforming its IT systems to support its 
evolving portfolio of businesses. We invest in new technologies, such 
as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to enhance our IT 
capabilities and bring value to the business. 
The growing dependence on IT and data brings risks. A breach of IT 
systems or loss of data could cause significant harm to Shell in the form 
of loss of productivity, loss of intellectual property, regulatory fines or 
reputational damage. Sanctions, including regulatory fines, might be 
imposed on Shell if authorities find Shell in breach of cyber security or 
data protection regulations. Cyber security is key to managing those 
risks, especially in today's increasingly regulated environment where 
cyber threats are growing.
Shell operates a multi-level defence strategy, underpinned by the Shell 
Performance Framework. Our advanced cyber defence capabilities 
help us prevent, detect, respond to and evolve as cyber security and 
data privacy risks become more complex. We continuously assess and, 
where relevant, improve these capabilities to reduce the likelihood of 
successful cyber attacks. 
Our global integrated Information Risk Management (IRM) and cyber 
defence teams are staffed with cyber security professionals that 
monitor, assure and defend our global IT landscape. The combined 
Global Functions Chief Information Officer and Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO) roles were split as of November 1, 2023. 
This resulted in a dedicated CISO role within Shell's Information & 
Digital Technology (IDT) leadership.
Cyber security risk management
Our cyber security capabilities are embedded in our IT systems and 
our IT is protected by various detective and protective technologies. 
A structured approach to identify, assess and mitigate IT and cyber 
security risks is built into our support processes and aligns with industry 
best practices. We continuously track cyber attacks, threat intelligence 
and vulnerabilities in our IT landscape and have an established incident 
management and escalation process in place. The security of IT 
services, where operated by external IT companies, is managed 
through contractual clauses and additionally through formal supplier 
assurance reports for critical IT services. Shell engages an external 
party to perform periodic benchmarking of Shell's approach to cyber 
security risk management in comparison to industry and peers. We 
develop our cyber security capabilities, based on external dynamics, 
benchmarking outcomes and assurance results and take a risk-based 
approach in our investment decisions related to cyber security risk 
strategy. Shell's first line of defence is formed by a workforce that is 
trained to be cyber security aware. In 2023, our annual safety day 
included cyber security awareness raising. Robust governance 
processes are embedded across Shell to increase cyber awareness, 
monitor key cyber risks, and provide risk assurance. Our IRM practices 
and cyber security risks and strategy are regularly discussed by 
and among our CISO, Shell's Information and Digital Technology 
leadership, the Executive Committee, the Audit and Risk Committee 
and the Board of Directors. These discussions involve consideration of 
changes in the external environment, how Shell is responding to cyber 
security risks and implementation of further remedial actions as 
appropriate. In 2023, these discussions were supplemented by 
dedicated deep dives into areas such as the emerging risks and 
opportunities associated with generative artificial intelligence. Shell 
employees and contract staff are required to complete mandatory 
training courses and participate in regular awareness campaigns 
aimed at protecting us against cyber threats. Shell has reported 
incidents in 2023 to regulatory authorities in several jurisdictions. 
None of these had a material impact on Shell, including its business 
strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
The IRM and cyber defence leadership teams involved in monitoring 
and managing our cyber security threat risk and assurance process 
have an average of around 25 years of experience. This group is 
led by our CISO, who has more than 20 years of experience in the 
information technology and information security field, including serving 
as the chief information officer for various large public companies. Our 
CISO holds qualified technical expert certifications, has completed the 
London School of Economics Executive Development programme and 
holds an undergraduate degree in management information systems, 
risk management and corporate finance. Our CISO is active in various 
cyber security industry trade groups, having previously held leadership 
positions in the Oil & Gas Cyber Security Network and the Chief 
Information Officers Strategy Exchange.
Projects & Technology
Projects & Technology and the relevant business lines work together 
to determine the content, scope and budget for developing new 
technology that supports our activities. The new technology is 
developed, using a robust maturation process, to systematically de-risk 
technical and commercial risks. This is done while we seek to align our 
portfolio with Shell's strategic ambitions and deployment commitments. 
A significant proportion of Shell's technology contributes to our 
emissions reduction targets. We collaborate with leading academic 
research institutes and universities, and provide start-ups with access 
to mentors and subject matter experts. Shell Ventures invests in 
and partners with start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises 
that are in the early stages of developing new technologies. 
The Shell GameChanger programme helps companies to mature
early-stage technologies.
See "Risk factors" on page 22.
Intellectual property
At Shell, we have a wide-ranging intellectual property (IP) portfolio 
which includes patents, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and 
copyrights. These legally recognised forms of IP enable companies to 
protect aspects of their IP and to derive value from them. For example, 
the distinctive Shell pecten, a trademark in use since the early 20
th
 
century, and trademarks in which the word Shell appears, help 
raise the profile of our brand globally. 
We protect and defend our IP around the world. Equally we respect 
the valid IP rights of others. Not doing so risks damage to our business 
and reputation, negatively impacts our ability or licence to operate, 
and could result in legal and financial risks as well as the loss of IP 
rights. At December 31, 2023, we held 8,829 patents, which includes 
granted patents and pending patent applications.
Shell holds trademarks in countries all around the world, including 
some in which we no longer have operations. For example, in 2023, 
we renewed our trademark LINEVOL in Syria and paid $370 to the 
Syrian Arab Republic, Ministry of Finance, and $713 in agent and 
handling fees. In addition, we renewed one international trademark 
application, which amongst other countries, included the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, through the World Intellectual Property Organization 
Madrid system, for a fee of $113 for Iran specifically. We ceased 
all operations in Syria in 2011 and Iran in 2018 and the renewals of our 
trademarks are not indicative of any sales of products in either country.

Introduction
Shell recognises that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the use 
of hydrocarbon-based energy contribute to climate change. The Paris 
Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of 
climate change by "holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and 
pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels". Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris 
Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature 
this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Shell's Powering Progress strategy is designed to generate shareholder 
value, while meeting our target of becoming a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050. 
Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD 
framework aims to improve the disclosure of climate-related risks and 
opportunities and provide stakeholders with the information they need 
to undertake robust and consistent analyses of the potential financial 
impacts of climate change. The TCFD recommends disclosure of 
qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core 
elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics 
and targets. 
We recognise the value that the recommendations bring and, 
in accordance with UK Listing Rule 9.8.6R, set out below our
climate-related financial disclosures consistent with all of the TCFD 
Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. By this we mean the 
four recommendations and the 11 recommended disclosures set out in 
Figure 4 of Section C of the report entitled "Recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures" published in June 
2017 by the TCFD. We also take into account relevant supplemental 
guidance including, for example, the TCFD's additional guidance 
"Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures" (also known as the 2021 TCFD 
Annex) published in October 2021 by the TCFD. We continue 
to align and enhance our climate-related disclosures.

Governance of climate-related
risks and opportunities
Board oversight of climate-related risks and 
opportunities
Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the 
energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress 
strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions.
See our "Powering Progress strategy" on pages 12-16.
The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically 
and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board 
considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including 
the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of 
corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged 
and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital 
expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. In 2023, the Board 
convened nine times and continued to oversee the Powering Progress 
strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy 
Days in June 2023.
See "Governance framework" on page 149 and "Board activities" on page 148.
The Board of Directors has the primary oversight of the delivery of 
Shell's energy transition strategy and is supported by the Sustainability 
Committee (SUSCO) [A], the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) and 
the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC). The importance of our energy 
transition strategy means that these committees are informed about 
climate-related matters on a frequent basis throughout the year. 
See "Climate change governance organogram" below.
[A] The SUSCO was previously the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee.
The SUSCO assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by reviewing 
Shell's progress with respect to climate and sustainability elements of 
Shell's Powering Progress strategy.
During 2023, the SUSCO refocused its agenda on the areas of 
greatest strategic importance to Shell, in line with its updated terms 
of reference. This allowed the SUSCO to more effectively oversee 
Shell's progress with respect to sustainability. 
The SUSCO reviewed the progress made against the non-financial 
elements of Shell's Powering Progress strategy, including progress 
against the ambitions and targets under the goals of achieving
net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives.
The SUSCO met four times in 2023. After each meeting, the SUSCO 
Chair provided updates to the Board. 
See the SUSCO's activities in 2023 on pages 160-161. 
The REMCO develops the remuneration policy for Executive Directors 
and Executive Committee members and sets performance conditions 
designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) 
to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. 
The REMCO met four times during 2023, with climate-related matters 
discussed at each meeting.
See "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 174-176 and the "Annual Report on 
Remuneration" on pages 177-193.
Climate performance and remuneration
Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus 
scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's 
employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees 
(12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026.
See "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 174-176 for further information.
See the "Governance framework" for the Board's oversight on pages 149-154.
The ARC provides oversight of the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and the integrity of our financial reporting to ensure that our 
financial statements reflect the risks and opportunities associated with 
our energy transition strategy and climate change. In 2023, the ARC 
met six times with climate-related matters regularly addressed. 
See the "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 162-173.

Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities
Climate change governance organogram
On January 30, 2023, Shell announced it would reduce the size of its 
EC with the changes taking effect from July 1, 2023. The new structure 
is designed to focus on performance, discipline and simplification 
across the organisation as we deliver our Powering Progress strategy. 
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the delegated authority from the 
Board to manage Shell's actions in relation to the Company's strategy. 
The CEO is assisted on climate-related matters by members of the EC 
to review and implement Shell's energy transition strategy and ensure 
that such matters are appropriately monitored:
￮ The Integrated Gas and Upstream Director is responsible for 
identifying and delivering low-carbon and emission-reduction 
investment opportunities in our oil and gas business, as well as 
managing and reducing carbon emissions from the business and 
using renewable energy to power our oil and gas extraction 
activities.
￮ The Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions Director 
is responsible for identifying and delivering climate-related 
opportunities, as well as managing and mitigating the climate risks 
of our Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions business. 
￮ The Projects & Technology (P&T) Director is responsible for setting 
emissions, climate and reporting standards that are applicable to all 
our businesses. The P&T Director is also responsible for developing 
new technologies that will help our businesses to deliver on net-zero 
emissions reduction targets through both energy efficiency measures 
and solutions for decarbonisation. 
￮ The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for monitoring the 
effective application of the Shell Performance Framework, which 
provides the basis for managing our material risks, including climate-
related risks and opportunities, and the assurance over our financial 
information, carbon emissions and climate-related disclosures. 
In addition, the CFO is responsible for Corporate Strategy, 
Sustainability and Carbon, including supporting the CEO in 
developing Shell's energy transition strategy and our Carbon 
Management Framework (CMF).

Additional supporting governance
There are two key supporting management committees, with 
representatives from across Shell, which play a critical role in 
driving our energy transition strategy:
￮ The Capital Investment Committee (CIC) facilitates portfolio 
management and capital allocation decisions and reviews each 
investment opportunity that is, due to its size or risk profile, subject 
to approval by the CEO or the Board. These reviews ensure that
risk-reward trade-offs, together with other defined criteria including 
climate risks and opportunities, are embedded in investment 
decision-making. This committee is made up of senior executives, 
including the CEO, CFO and individual business directors.
￮ The Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC) includes senior 
management representatives focusing on climate-related matters 
from across the businesses, P&T climate-related disciplines and 
functions including Finance, Legal and Strategy. The CRC is 
responsible at the Group level for the Carbon Control Framework, 
the calculation methodologies and reporting of GHG emissions 
metrics, and the review and approval of external GHG-related 
disclosures. It is tasked with ensuring that GHG emissions measures, 
both absolute emissions and carbon intensities, and associated 
metrics comply with all regulatory and legal requirements. 
In addition to these committees, our network of country chairs supports 
the overall governance, development and deployment of climate-
related initiatives. They facilitate the setting of each country's plans and 
their engagement with external stakeholders in support of our strategy.
Processes by which management is informed about 
climate-related issues 
Several processes are employed across the organisation to ensure 
that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-
related matters. Our response to the evolving risk outlook requires 
transparency and clarity around our plans and actions to achieve our 
climate targets. The management teams are supported by a 
combination of carbon-management-related standards and 
frameworks, forums at various levels of the organisation, and capability 
development programmes. These include our carbon management 
framework (CMF), carbon pricing, and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
and Energy Management process, policies and controls, which form 
part of our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social 
Performance (HSSE & SP) Control Framework.
Carbon management framework
Shell's CMF provides the structure and processes to drive 
delivery of Group carbon targets. The CMF seeks to manage 
and reduce emissions in a manner that is similar to how we use 
our financial framework. Carbon budgets are used as input to 
and guidance for the annual business plan process. They act as 
an effective mechanism to maintain absolute emissions below 
a capped level and help drive a change in product mix. The 
carbon budgets are allocated to the businesses and enable 
trade-offs between emitting carbon and generating shareholder 
value to occur within those budgets. The CMF informs portfolio 
decisions and supports delivery of our decarbonisation targets.
For the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity 
(NCI) targets were translated into net absolute emissions 
budgets for each business (see definition on page 86). 
These budgets were used by each business to optimise their 
operating plans. Performance against the targets embedded 
in the operating plan and the relative mix of products driving 
the Group's NCI are monitored and reviewed by the EC on 
a quarterly basis, facilitating corrective action if required.
Examples of how our decarbonisation targets are taken into 
account in fundamental decisions across the organisation are:
￮ Carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) is 
a key parameter considered in decision-making and when 
comparing different growth opportunities against each 
other within the various businesses.
￮ We translate our carbon targets into carbon budgets for 
each business as input and guidance to the annual business 
plan process. Businesses need to deliver a plan that 
maximises value within their carbon budgets.

Greenhouse gas and energy management
Each Shell entity and Shell-operated venture is responsible 
for the development of its GHG emissions and energy 
management plans. Plans are in place for all significant assets.
Our Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management process sets 
out Shell's requirements for GHG reduction opportunities and 
portfolio choices to meet our carbon budgets and achieve 
our decarbonisation targets. These requirements allocate 
accountabilities for GHG and energy management within 
businesses, assets and projects, including responsibility for 
analysing our emissions, benchmarking performance, identifying 
improvement opportunities, and forecasting future performance. 
These requirements are applied to capital project delivery and 
through the asset-level annual business planning process, 
ensuring it is reflected in both opportunity realisation and 
strategic asset management planning.
A key aspect of the GHG and Energy Management process 
is the development of an energy efficiency and greenhouse gas 
reduction opportunity curve, economically assessed against the 
current and future costs of carbon. This information provides the 
basis for forecasts of absolute GHG emissions and associated 
intensities at the asset and project level. These forecasts are then 
aggregated to inform decisions on potential decarbonisation 
opportunities across our businesses.
A Global Process Council for GHG and Energy Management, 
led by the Global Process Owner for GHG and including 
business and functional experts, meets regularly to evaluate 
opportunities for the ongoing improvement of processes, tools, 
communications, and capabilities needed within the businesses 
to achieve our decarbonisation aspirations.
The requirements of our GHG & Energy Management Process 
are integrated into our annual business planning cycle.
Definition - Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
We follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of 
GHG emissions:
￮ Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources under Shell's 
operational control.
￮ Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from generation of 
purchased energy consumed by Shell assets under 
operational control.
￮ Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions 
associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.
Carbon pricing
We consider the potential costs associated with operational 
GHG emissions when we assess the resilience of projects. For 
each region, we have developed short-, medium- and long-term 
estimates of future costs of carbon. These are reviewed 
and updated annually. See Note 4 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" for further details on our regional 
cost of carbon estimates. 
Up to 2030, costs for carbon emissions estimates are largely 
policy driven through emission trading schemes or taxation 
which is levied by governments and which varies significantly 
on a country-by-country basis. Beyond 2030, where policy 
predictions are more challenging, the costs for carbon emissions 
are estimated based on the expected costs of abatement 
technologies required for 2050. The estimated cost is trending 
towards $125 or $170 per tonne (RT23), depending on the 
country, in 2050. Shell’s mid-price outlook of $125 - $170 per 
tonne used for the operating plan sits within the middle tranche 
of the abatement costs range of $100 - $200 which 
incorporates a broad range of technologies.
See "The resilience of Shell's strategy" on page 92 for more information 
on how carbon costs impact our resilience to climate-related risks, including 
sensitivity analysis.
See the "Shell Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report 2023" which will 
be published in April 2024 for more information on Shell's advocacy across a range 
of issues including carbon pricing.

Energy transition strategy
Powering Progress is our strategy to generate more value with less 
emissions for the benefit of our shareholders, customers and wider 
society as we work to become a net-zero emissions energy business 
by 2050. Our purpose -- to provide more and cleaner energy solutions 
– drives our strategy.
Our strategy supports a balanced energy transition by responsibly 
delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build 
the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are 
becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and 
cleaner energy solutions. Our energy transition plans cover all our 
businesses. They aim to reduce emissions from our operations, and help 
our customers transition to cost-competitive and cleaner energy.
We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our 
customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy 
transition plans cover all our businesses:
￮ Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with 
lower carbon intensity.
￮ Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production, while 
keeping oil production stable.
￮ Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions – Transforming our 
businesses to offer more low-carbon solutions, while reducing sales 
of oil products.
See the "Our strategy" section on pages 13-15.
Board holds Strategy Days in 
Canada and visits LNG project
In June 2023, the Board held its Strategy Days in Canada, 
where members discussed the key elements of Shell's energy 
transition strategy with the Executive Committee. Board 
members also visited LNG Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-
operated), which is being built on the west coast of Canada. 
They met with employees, customers, suppliers and other key 
stakeholders, including leaders of the Haisla Nation in the 
nearby community of Kitimat, British Columbia. 
LNG Canada is expected to start production in the middle of this 
decade. It is designed to have the lowest carbon intensity of any 
large liquefaction facility currently operating anywhere in the 
world ― about 60% lower than the average facility today and 
35% lower than the best-performing facility.

Our strategy aims to support the more ambitious 
goal of the Paris Agreement
Tackling climate change is an urgent challenge. It requires 
a fundamental transformation of the global economy and the 
energy system so that society stops adding to the total amount 
of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is 
known as net-zero emissions. That is why Shell has set a target 
to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. 
The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response 
to the threat of climate change by "holding the increase in 
the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels". Shell supports the 
more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the 
rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels. 
To help us get there, we have set short-, medium- and long-term 
targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products 
we sell, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We 
believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway derived 
from scenarios developed for the IPCCs Sixth Assessment 
Report (AR6). For more information see "Setting targets for 
NCI" on page 105.
Becoming a net-zero emissions energy business means reducing 
emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other 
energy products, such as electricity, that we sell to our 
customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining 
emissions using technology, protecting natural carbon sinks, 
and providing high-quality carbon credits to our customers 
to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.
An increasing number of countries and companies have 
announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by the 
middle of the century, and we are starting to see some 
changes in the demand and supply of energy. However, 
achieving the 1.5°C goal will be challenging and requires 
unprecedented global collaboration. The pace of change 
will also vary around the world.
Climate-related risks and opportunities identified 
by Shell over the short, medium and long term
We are continually enhancing our approach to assessing and 
managing risks and opportunities resulting from climate change. 
This includes considering different time horizons and their relevance to 
risk identification and business planning. We actively monitor societal 
developments, such as regulation-driven carbon pricing mechanisms 
and customer-driven preferences for products. We incorporate these 
into potential scenarios which provide insights into how the energy 
transition may unfold in the medium and long term. These insights and 
those from various other external scenarios (such as those prepared 
for the IPCC AR6) guide how we set our strategic direction, capital 
allocation and carbon emission reduction targets.
The process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and 
opportunities is set out in the "Climate Risk Management" section. Shell 
has identified climate change and the associated energy transition as 
a material risk based on societal concerns and developments related 
to climate change and managing GHG emissions. The risks could 
potentially result in changes to the demand for our products, supply 
chains and markets; further changes to the regulatory environment in 
which we operate, and increased litigation (see Note 31 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements "Legal proceedings and other 
contingencies" on page 287). The risks are composed of a combination 
Strategic Report | Performance in the year
Our journey to net zero continued
87 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 89 ----
of complex and interrelated elements that affect Shell's overall business 
value chain, and our asset, product and business portfolio. The risk 
landscape is evolving rapidly. To achieve our emissions reduction 
targets, active holistic management of all climate-related risk 
components is important. The composite risk is broken down
into the following sub-components:
￮ commercial risk;
￮ regulatory risk;
￮ societal risk (including litigation risk); and
￮ physical risk.
Overall, we mitigate climate-related risks through our Powering 
Progress strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. With our 
focus on performance, discipline and simplification, we believe that 
we are in a better position to achieve both our financial targets and 
climate-related targets and ambitions. This approach includes:
￮ reducing the GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) 
by improving our energy efficiency, deploying renewable electricity, 
managing flaring and reducing methane emissions from our assets 
and projects;
￮ growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business, 
while decarbonising our LNG portfolio in two main ways: by 
growing our portfolio with a lower carbon intensity, and by focusing 
on reducing emissions of methane;
￮ managing our Upstream portfolio to support a balanced energy 
transition by cutting emissions from oil and gas production, while 
keeping oil production stable. Oil production is increasingly from
our deep-water business which, through innovation, produces
higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels; and
￮ transforming our businesses in Downstream and Renewables and 
Energy Solutions to offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing 
sales of oil products. 
In addition, we are working to effectively adapt our assets and 
activities to enhance our resilience to the physical risks related 
to climate change where needed.
See page 90 for more details of Physical risks.
We are also working with governments on their climate policies to help 
establish regulatory frameworks that will enable society to reach the 
goals of the Paris Agreement. 
We signed up to the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter announced 
at COP28, within which organisations have pledged to achieve near-
zero methane emissions by 2030 and zero routine flaring by no later 
than 2030. We also intend to contribute to the World Bank's Global 
Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund, which was launched at COP28.
As a leading global energy business, Shell seeks to identify 
opportunities in the energy transition. These risks and opportunities 
are described below. Climate-related risks are also summarised in 
the "Risk factors" section of the Strategic Report on page 18.
Time horizons: short, medium and long
Due to the inherent uncertainty and pervasive risks across our strategy 
and business model, we monitor climate-related risks and opportunities 
across multiple time horizons. 
￮ Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial 
projections and use them to manage performance and expectations 
on a three-year cycle. These projections incorporate decarbonisation 
measures required to meet our short-term targets.
￮ Medium term (generally three to 10 years): these are embedded 
within our operating plan, with our continued focus on the customer, 
the investments and portfolio shifts required in the medium term that 
will reshape Shell's portfolio. 
￮ Long term (generally beyond 10 years): it is expected that our 
portfolio and product mix will look very different.
Transition risks
Climate-related commercial risk
￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy may lead to lower sales volumes and/or margins due to a 
general reduction or elimination of demand for oil and gas products, possibly resulting in underutilised 
or stranded oil and gas assets, and a failure to secure new opportunities.
￮ Changing preferences of investors and financial institutions could reduce access to and increase the 
cost of capital.
Relevant time horizon:
medium and long
Potential material impacts on the organisation
Lower demand and margins for oil and 
gas products 
Changing customer sentiment towards renewable 
and sustainable energy products may reduce 
demand for our oil and gas products. An excess of 
supply over demand could reduce fossil fuel prices. 
This could be a factor contributing to additional 
provisions for our assets and result in lower 
earnings, cancelled projects and potential 
impairment of certain assets.
Changing preferences of investors and 
financial institutions
Financial institutions are increasingly aligning 
their portfolios to a low-carbon and net-zero world, 
driven by both regulatory and broader stakeholder 
pressures. A failure to decarbonise the business 
portfolios in line with investor and lender 
expectations could have a material adverse effect 
on our ability to use financing for certain types 
of projects. This could also adversely affect our 
partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, 
either through equity or debt.
Sensitivity analysis of a 1% shift in Shell's weighted 
average cost of capital on asset carrying values is 
presented in the section "Carbon pricing and 
discount rate sensitivities" on page 94.
Remaining in step with the pace and 
extent of the energy transition
The energy transition provides us with significant 
opportunities, as described in "Transition 
opportunities" below. If we fail to stay in step with 
the pace and extent of change or customers' and 
other stakeholders' demand for low-carbon products, 
this could adversely affect our reputation and future 
earnings. If we move much faster than society, we 
risk investing in technologies, markets or low-carbon 
products that are unsuccessful. Therefore we cannot 
transition too quickly or we will be trying to sell 
products that customers do not want. This could also 
have a material adverse effect on financial results.
Technology and innovation are essential to our efforts 
to help meet the world's energy demands competitively. 
If we are unable to develop the right technology and 
products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we 
develop technologies, products and solutions that harm 
the environment or people's health, there could be an 
adverse effect on our future earnings.

Transition risks continued
Climate-related regulatory risk
The transition to a low-carbon economy will likely increase the cost of compliance for our assets and/or 
products, and may include restrictions on the use of hydrocarbons. The lack of net-zero-aligned global 
and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around this risk.
Relevant time horizon:
short, medium and long
Potential material impacts on the organisation
Increased compliance costs 
Some governments have introduced carbon pricing 
mechanisms, which we believe can be an effective 
way to reduce GHG emissions across the economy 
at the lowest overall cost to society. 
Shell's cost of compliance with the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme (ETS) and related schemes was 
around $493 million in 2023, as recognised in 
Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income for 2023. 
A further $3,133 million of costs were incurred in 
respect of biofuels ($2,581 million) and renewable 
power ($552 million) programmes (see Note 5 to 
the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on 
pages 244-245).
Shell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to 
increase over the next decade because of evolving 
carbon regulations. The forecast annual cost exposure is 
estimated to be around $1 billion in 2024 and around 
$4 billion in 2033. This estimate is based on a forecast 
of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and 
non-operated assets, and real-term carbon cost estimates 
using the mid-price scenario (see Note 4 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 231-243 
for more information). This exposure also takes into 
account the estimated impact of free allowances as 
relevant to assets based on their location. 
Restrictions on use of hydrocarbons
As of June 2023, more than 90% of the 
global economy was signed up to net-zero 
commitments, according to the Net Zero Stocktake 
2023 report from Net Zero Tracker. This brings an 
increasing risk that governments may set future 
regulatory frameworks that further restrict 
exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and 
introduce controls to limit the use of such products. 
Failure to replace proved reserves could result in an 
accelerated decrease of future production, which 
could have a material adverse effect on our 
earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
Lack of net-zero-aligned global and 
national policies and frameworks 
The lack of net-zero-aligned global and national 
policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty 
around how carbon pricing and other regulatory 
mechanisms will be implemented in the future. This 
makes it harder to determine the appropriate 
assumptions to be taken into account in our financial 
planning and investment decision processes.
Climate-related societal risk (including litigation risk)
As societal expectations develop around climate change, there is a potential impact on Shell's licence 
to operate, reputation, brand and competitive position. This is likely to include litigation.
Relevant time horizon:
short, medium and long
Potential material impacts on the organisation
Decline in reputation and brand
Societal expectations of businesses are increasing, 
with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, 
contribution to society, safety and minimising 
damage to the environment. There is an increasing 
focus on the role of the oil and gas sector in the 
context of climate change and the energy 
transition. This could negatively affect our brand, 
reputation and licence to operate, which could limit 
our ability to deliver our strategy, reduce consumer 
demand for our branded and non-branded 
products, harm our ability to secure new resources 
and contracts, and restrict our ability to access 
capital markets or attract staff.
Deteriorating relationships with 
key stakeholders
Failure to decarbonise Shell's value chain in 
line with societal, governmental and investor 
expectations is a material risk to Shell's reputation 
as a responsible and market-leading energy 
company. The impact of this risk includes 
shareholder divestment, greater regulatory 
scrutiny and potential asset closure resulting 
from public interest groups' protests.
Litigation
There is an increasing risk to oil and gas companies 
from public, private and governmental lawsuits. 
Such action may have wide-ranging consequences, 
including forcing entities to hand over strategic 
autonomy in part to regulators, divest from 
hydrocarbon technologies, denial of regulatory 
approvals and/or paying fines/penalties or large 
compensation packages to the plaintiff.
Litigation continued
In some countries, governments, regulators, 
organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits of 
a wide variety, including seeking to hold oil and gas 
companies liable for costs associated with climate 
change, or seeking court-ordered reductions in 
emissions, challenging the regulatory approvals and 
operating licences, or challenging energy transition 
strategies and plans. While we believe these lawsuits 
to be without merit, losing could have a material 
adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and 
financial condition. 
For example, in May 2021, the District Court in The 
Hague, the Netherlands, ruled that by end 2030, 
Shell must reduce its aggregate net Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions by 45%, compared with 2019 levels. The 
Scope 1 component is a results-based obligation 
and the Scope 2 and 3 components are a significant 
best-efforts obligation. 
We have appealed the ruling but continue to 
implement our Powering Progress strategy to become 
a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, 
regardless of the outcome of the appeal.

Physical risks
Climate-related physical risk
The potential physical effects of climate change may impact Shell's assets, operations, supply chains, 
employees and markets.
Relevant time horizon:
short, medium and long
Potential material impacts on the organisation
Types of physical risk
Mitigation of physical risks, whether or not related 
to climate change, is considered and embedded 
in the design and construction of our projects, 
and/or operation of our assets to minimise the 
risk of adverse incidents to our employees and 
contractors, the communities where we operate, 
and our equipment. 
The potential impact of physical changes comes 
from both acute and chronic physical risks. Acute 
risks, such as flooding and droughts, wildfires and 
more severe tropical storms, and chronic risks, such 
as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, could 
potentially impact some of our facilities, operations 
and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards 
and impacts is expected to increase in certain high-
risk locations. Extreme weather events, whether 
or not related to climate change, could have 
a negative impact on our earnings, cash flows 
and financial condition.
Shell's 2023 assessment
In 2023 we carried out a detailed review to 
assess the impact of a range of changing climatic 
conditions including changes in temperature, 
precipitation, wind and sea levels across segments 
and geographies for our significant assets. We used 
IPCC climate modelling data covering three future 
climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 [A]) 
across the time horizons 2025, 2030 and 2050.
In the short to medium term, the risks were found 
to be related to factors that Shell is already aware 
of (whether or not related to climate change) and 
the assets are actively managing to mitigate, e.g. 
hurricane impacts in the US Gulf Coast, rising air 
temperatures in the Middle East and water scarcity 
in Europe and Asia. As an example, in recent years 
the Rhine river in Europe has seen historic lows 
during the summer months leading to challenges in 
the use of barges for transportation of our products. 
Dredging of harbours and investment in shallower-
draft barges have helped to mitigate the risk.
In the long term, the results of the exercise indicated 
that while we have evaluated against current known 
risk factors and our current asset portfolio, the 
frequency and severity of the identified risk factors 
may increase by 2050. The level of predictability 
is such that the need for investment in climate 
adaptation measures at the assets is not immediate 
and the results mean we are in a position to monitor 
the assets and determine whether there is any need 
for adaptation action, e.g. the impact of potential 
water scarcity on various assets.
We tested over 70% of the carrying value of our 
physical assets as at  December 31, 2022, to assess 
the potential impact of climate-related changes on 
our significant assets. 13% (based on the carrying 
value) of physical assets tested are considered to be 
exposed to climate-related physical risks in the short 
to medium term which the assets are already actively 
managing to mitigate. In addition, we reviewed 
significant acquisitions made in 2023 of which none 
are considered to be exposed to climate-related 
physical risks in the short to medium term.
Our plan reflects the impact of mitigating actions in 
the short to medium term. We will continue to monitor 
and assess the future exposure of our assets in the 
longer term to changing climatic conditions to 
establish the need for any further adaptation 
actions and related metrics. 
Shell's 2023 assessment continued
Additionally, the impact of physical climate change 
on our operations is unlikely to be limited to the 
boundaries of our assets. The overall impact, 
including how supply chains, resource availability 
and markets may be affected, also needs to be 
considered for a holistic assessment of this risk. 
Our assets manage this risk as part of broad risk 
and threat management processes as required 
by our HSSE & SP Control Framework, part of 
the wider Shell Performance Framework.
[A] Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) refers to the greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectory adopted by the IPCC. The pathways describe different climate change 
scenarios, all of which are considered possible depending on the amount of GHG emitted in the years to come.

Transition opportunities
Climate-related opportunities
The transition to a low-carbon economy also brings significant opportunities for us to benefit from changing 
customer demands, given our position as a leading global energy provider.
Relevant time horizon:
short, medium and long
Potential material impacts on the organisation
As the global energy mix changes, our current infrastructure, know-how and global footprint put us in an ideal position to service the changing energy demands 
of the market. Our research and development (R&D) activities are key to achieving our net-zero emissions target. 
As we work to deliver more value with less emissions we 
are focusing on:
1. Natural gas
Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to 
continue to grow. As one of the world's largest suppliers of 
LNG, with around 40 million tonnes of equity capacity, we 
can ship natural gas to where it is needed. LNG is critical to 
the energy transition and plays an important role in enabling 
countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a less 
carbon-intensive alternative, and provides grid stability 
alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. 
Shell seeks to provide more affordable, reliable and cleaner 
energy to our customers. 
In October 2023, we and our partners in the Oman 
LNG LLC (Oman LNG) venture signed an amended 
shareholders' agreement for Oman LNG, extending the 
business beyond 2024. We will remain the largest private 
shareholder in Oman LNG, with a 30% interest.
2. Continuing the transformation of our 
remaining integrated refineries into energy 
and chemicals parks
An important aim of our Powering Progress strategy is 
to continue to transform selected integrated refineries 
into energy and chemicals parks, which includes 
repurposing units to deliver more lower-carbon,
high-value, sustainable products.
We are continuing to transform our refining business as 
part of our drive to create more value with less emissions. 
In early 2024, we announced our investment decision to 
convert the hydrocracker at our Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rheinland in Germany into a unit that will produce premium 
base oils, used to make high-quality lubricants, such as 
engine and transmission oils. The hydrocracker at the 
Wesseling site near Cologne will stop processing crude oil 
into petrol, diesel and jet fuel diesel by 2025. The planned 
changes are expected to reduce Shell's Scope 1 and 2 
carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year.
3. Biofuels 
Developing biofuels production is a key theme 
of our energy transition strategy. We are 
developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation 
fuel, biodiesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) 
to help our customers decarbonise without having 
to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships.
Shell and the non-operated joint venture Raízen 
(Shell interest 44%) are together one of the 
world's largest blenders and distributors of 
biofuels. Shell plans to continue to invest in and 
increase the production of these low-carbon fuels. 
Our low-carbon fuels projects and operations 
around the world form part of a wider 
commitment to provide a range of energy choices 
for customers. For example, we believe that 
sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) provide the most 
effective way of reducing emissions within the 
aviation sector, with wider adoption of SAF 
enabling us to provide more low-carbon fuels 
to our customers. Biofuels may also present 
opportunities in the shipping, road freight and 
other sectors. Together with our customers, we 
are working on changing energy demand and 
developing ways to help increase the use of low-
carbon fuels and decrease carbon emissions 
from this sector. 
Shell completed the acquisition of Nature 
Energy in February 2023, one of the largest 
producers of RNG in Europe. This acquisition 
supports Shell's ambitions to build an integrated 
RNG value chain at global scale and to 
profitably grow its low-carbon offerings 
to customers across multiple sectors. 
In 2023, we announced a multi-year agreement 
to buy sustainable aviation fuel from Montana 
Renewables, the largest SAF producer in North 
America, and to work together on building 
blending and distribution capabilities to deliver 
SAF to customers. We also signed an agreement 
to supply SAF to Emirates airlines at Dubai 
International Airport, the first time that SAF 
has been used in the airport's fuelling system. 
4. Downstream, Renewables and 
Energy Solutions
This encompasses our biofuels, charging for 
electric vehicles, renewable power, hydrogen 
and fuels of the future businesses as well 
as developing our carbon capture and 
storage business. 
In March 2023, we entered into a joint venture 
with Eku Energy (Shell interest 45%) to deliver 
a utility-scale battery energy storage system 
in Australia. We have access to 100% of the 
battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. 
Completion of the project is expected in 
late 2024.
In June 2023, Hollandse Kust Noord, our 
offshore wind park in the Netherlands (Shell 
interest 79.9%), delivered its first megawatts 
of renewable electricity.
In 2023, Shell's spending on CCS opportunities 
(operating expenses and cash capital 
expenditure) amounted to around $340 million, 
an increase of 55% from the $220 million in 
2022. Shell's equity share of captured and 
stored CO2 was around 0.5 million tonnes 
in 2023 (0.4 million tonnes in 2022).
Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on 
Shell's businesses, strategy and financial planning
The transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will 
require simultaneous action in three areas:
￮ an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy 
is used;
￮ a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix; and
￮ the mitigation of residual emissions using technology and 
natural sinks. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will 
deliver the net-zero goal, scenarios help us to consider the variables 
and the potential direction and pace of the transition needed. 
Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or 
outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for Shell's operating plans 
and financial statements. 
We have been developing scenarios within Shell for almost 50 years, 
helping Shell leaders to explore ways forward and make better 
decisions. Shell Scenarios are designed to stretch management's 
thinking when it comes to considering events that may be remotely 
possible. Scenarios help management make choices in times
of uncertainty and transition as we grapple with tough energy and 
environmental issues. They are aligned to different energy transition 
pathways and help in decision-making by guiding the identification
of risks and opportunities.

Our journey to net zero continued
91 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 93 ----
Different socio-economic and technological parameters are used
to construct these scenarios, such as:
￮ sectoral and regional energy demand;
￮ future trajectory of oil consumption and demand for natural gas; 
￮ renewable electricity demand and the pace of the electrification
of the global energy system;
￮ supply of solar and wind energy;
￮ pace of uptake of electric vehicles;
￮ demand for biofuels;
￮ growth of the hydrogen economy;
￮ level of carbon capture and storage (CCS); 
￮ deployment of lower-carbon energy technologies; and
￮ global trade of oil and gas.
Management consideration of different climate change outcomes 
informs a range of areas, including but not limited to the setting of the 
long-term strategy, business planning, and investment and divestment 
decisions. The outcomes considered by management vary in relation
to the extent and pace of the energy transition.
Impact on strategic planning
The application of scenario analysis informs our assessment of the 
impact of a wide range of risks and opportunities, including climate-
change-related issues, on our strategy and business planning at the 
Group and business levels. At the Group level, the potential impacts of 
the energy transition on our business model are discussed and assessed 
by the Board and the Executive Committee as part of the annual 
strategic and business planning cycle. This assessment allows us to 
challenge accepted ways of thinking, identify material risks and 
opportunities, and identify key tensions and trade-offs.
Key financial and non-financial components 
of business planning
The Board approves our annual business plan. The plan 
contains operational and financial metrics, and its objective 
is to drive the delivery of our Powering Progress strategy. 
Decarbonisation targets are key to our business planning 
process. Each business owner offers viable Scope 1, 2 and 3 
reduction opportunities as part of this process, in line with the 
CMF (see page 85).
The business plan is underpinned by assumptions about internal 
and external parameters and includes: 
￮ commodity prices;
￮ refining margins;
￮ production levels and product demand;
￮ exchange rates; 
￮ future carbon costs;
￮ the schedules of capital investment programmes; and 
￮ risks and opportunities that may have material impacts 
on free cash flow.
These assumptions are developed with input from our scenarios 
and internal estimates and outlooks. The level of uncertainty 
around these assumptions increases over longer time horizons.
Impact on business and financial planning
There is no single scenario that underpins Shell's business and 
financial planning. Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of 
likely future events or outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for 
Shell's operating plans and financial statements. Our scenarios help 
in developing our future oil and gas pricing outlooks. The oil and 
gas pricing outlooks take account of factors relating to the energy 
transition, such as potential changes in supply and demand (see details 
of scenario parameters above). The low-, medium- and high-pricing 
outlooks are prepared by a team of experts, reviewed by the EC and 
approved by the CEO and CFO. The mid-pricing outlook represents 
management's reasonable best estimate and is the basis for Shell's 
financial statements, operating plans and impairment testing. 
Shell's operating plan reflects Shell's energy transition strategy. We will 
continue to update our business plan, price outlooks and assumptions 
as we move towards net-zero emissions by 2050.
As described in "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by 
Shell over the short, medium and long term", the low-pricing outlooks 
could result in increased commercial, regulatory and societal risks, 
as well as transition opportunities. How these risks are prioritised is 
described in "Shell's processes for identifying and assessing climate-
related risks". Given our target to become a net-zero emissions energy 
business by 2050, the use of low-pricing outlooks is part of our 
resilience testing and resulting actions. 
Our strategy and national net-zero commitments 
In accordance with UK Listing Rule 9.8.6FG, we have 
considered the extent to which country-level net-zero 
commitments have been considered in developing our 
transition plan.
Our Powering Progress strategy aims to deliver a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050. The pace of the energy 
transition will be heavily influenced by government policy, 
creating a strong country and regional dimension in seeking 
to deliver the aims of the Paris Agreement. Our commitment 
is a global one and, as such, we look to deliver our strategy 
through a global lens.
We seek to translate our energy transition strategy into specific 
targets and plans at a business segment level, ensuring we take 
capital deployment and portfolio decisions in the context of the 
globally integrated nature of our operations. However, we 
continue to recognise the importance of engagement and 
collaboration in delivering the fundamental changes to the 
energy system that are required. This includes supporting and 
advocating for policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions 
and working with governments and other stakeholders in the 
development of policy that supports the transition to a low-
carbon energy system. As national transition plans develop, 
consideration will be given to the impact on our operations and 
the associated implications for our energy transition strategy.
Resilience of Shell's strategy to different
climate-related scenarios 
Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the 
ability to reshape our portfolio as the energy system transforms. 
They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets.
As we work towards net-zero emissions, we continue to exercise focus 
and discipline to optimise our capital allocation, balancing energy 
security and demand, as well as internal and external transition 
considerations and opportunities. We will make clear, disciplined 
choices about where we can create the most value for our investors 
and customers through the energy transition.

Key aspects of Shell's financial resilience in the context of climate-
related impacts are assessed and described in more detail in Note 4
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". This describes how Shell 
has considered climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial 
statements and how this translates into the valuation of assets and 
measurement of liabilities. Shell's financial statements are based on 
reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's 
best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in 
the foreseeable future. 
Sensitivity analysis using external, and often normative, climate 
scenarios has been performed for the period covering asset life cycles. 
If these different price outlooks were used, this would impact the 
recoverability of certain assets recognised in the "Consolidated 
Balance Sheet" as at December 31, 2023.
As there is no single scenario that underpins our plans, sensitivity 
analysis has been conducted using a range of key assumptions to 
test the resilience of our asset base. This includes sensitivity analysis 
on asset carrying values using commodity price outlooks from external, 
and often normative, climate change scenarios; shifting trends in our 
portfolio, particularly exploration and evaluation, Upstream production 
and refineries; risks related to stranded assets; resilience of investments 
for transformation of our refining sites into energy and chemicals parks; 
carbon price sensitivities; chemicals and refining margins price 
sensitivities; discount rate sensitivities; demand sensitivities; onerous 
contracts; forecast taxable profits sufficient to recover deferred 
tax assets; dividend resilience; and limited risk on timing of 
decommissioning and restoration activities for Integrated Gas 
and Upstream. 
Commodity price sensitivities
Oil and gas prices are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's 
financial statements, with the mid-price outlook informed by Shell's 
scenario planning representing management's best estimate. Price 
outlooks reflect a broad range of factors, including but not limited 
to future supply and demand, and the pace of growth of low-carbon 
solutions. The scenarios have been selected to illustrate the resilience of 
the asset base under a range of possible outcomes, including the price 
implications arising from the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario which 
provides a potential path for the global energy system to net-zero 
emissions by 2050. Sensitivities of asset carrying amounts to prices 
are under the assumption that all other factors in the models used 
to calculate impacts remain unchanged. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed using price outlooks from:
1. Average prices from three 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate 
change scenarios: In view of the broad range of price outlooks 
across the various scenarios, the average of three external price 
outlooks was taken from IHS Markit/ACCS 2023; Woodmac 
WM AET-1.5 degree; and IEA NZE50.
Applying these prices to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion and 
Upstream assets of $84 billion as at December 31, 2023, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $12-16 billion and $3-5 billion lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. 
2. Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: for this Shell's mid-price outlook is 
applied for the next 10 years. Because of greater uncertainty, the IEA 
normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied for the period after 
10 years. This gives less weight to the price-risk uncertainty in the first 
10 years reflected in the Operating Plan period and applies more risk 
to the more uncertain subsequent periods. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion and 
Upstream assets of $84 billion as at December 31, 2023, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $8-10 billion and $1-3 billion lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023.
3. A 1.5 degree scenario, derived from IEA NZE50: This priceline 
applies the IEA normative Net Zero Emissions scenario over the 
whole period under review and reflects the sensitivity to a pure
net-zero emissions scenario from the IEA. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion and 
Upstream assets of $84 billion as at December 31, 2023, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $15-20 billion and $3-5 billion lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023.
In addition, further sensitivities are provided of -10% or +10% to Shell's 
mid-price outlook, as an average percentage over the full period. 
A change of -10% or +10% to the mid-price outlook, as an average 
percentage over the full period, would result in around $5-8 billion 
impairment or some $2-5 billion impairment reversal, respectively, 
in Integrated Gas and Upstream as at December 31, 2023. Compared 
with the prior year, the higher impact of a 10% decrease in commodity 
prices is mainly driven by lower headroom for certain assets between 
carrying value and recoverable value at December 31, 2023.
Carbon pricing and discount rate sensitivities
The risk of stranded assets may increase in a higher-carbon-price 
scenario. Sensitivities of our asset carrying values to carbon prices have 
been based on an IEA NZE 2050 scenario to illustrate the resilience 
of asset carrying values to higher long-term carbon prices than those 
included in the Shell mid-price outlook.
Applying the IEA NZE 2050 carbon price scenario to Integrated Gas 
assets of $72 billion and Upstream assets of $84 billion, up to the end 
of life of these assets, shows recoverable amounts that are $2-4 billion 
and $1 billion lower, respectively, than the carrying amounts as at 
December 31, 2023.
Applying the IEA NZE 2050 carbon price scenario to Chemicals and 
Products assets of $44 billion shows recoverable amounts that are 
$3-4 billion lower than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. 
For Chemicals and Products, increased carbon cost could potentially 
be recovered partially through increased product sale prices.
See "Carbon pricing" on page 86 for more information on our carbon price assumptions.
The discount rate applied for impairment testing is based on a 
nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and 
is determined at 7.5%, except for power generation in the Renewables 
and Energy Solutions segment where 6% is applied. The discount rate 
includes systematic risk for energy transition risk. In addition, cash flow 
projections applied in individual assets include specific asset risks, 
including risk of transition. An increase in systematic climate risk could 
lead to a higher WACC and consequently to a higher discount rate to 
be applied in impairment testing. We have used a 1% shift in discount 
rate for sensitivity analysis purposes as an indicator of the resilience of 
our asset base to incremental increases in our cost of capital.
An increase of the WACC of 1% under the assumption that all other 
factors in the models used to calculate recoverability of carrying amounts 
remain unchanged would lead to a change in the carrying amount of 
$2-4 billion for Integrated Gas and Upstream and up to $1 billion in 
Chemicals and Products, and no significant impairment in other segments.
See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 231-243 for further 
information on climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial statements.

Delivering our energy transition strategy 
To ensure the resilience of our Powering Progress strategy, our 
responses to the risks and opportunities identified are: 
￮ delivery through our integrated business model;
￮ decarbonisation of our energy value chains and operations; and
￮ a demand-driven decarbonisation approach – recognising that 
we need to work with our customers to identify low-carbon energy 
solutions for their energy demands in the sectors where we have 
competitive advantages.
Our net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, as well 
as from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. We will seek 
to reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production 
of oil and gas. More than 90% of the total emissions we include within 
our NCI boundary are indirect emissions associated with third-party 
products and end-use emissions of energy products we sell, so we 
are also working with our customers to support them in transitioning 
to low-carbon products and services. Our integrated approach 
allows us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets. Our financial 
framework is based on continued capital discipline, capital flexibility 
and a strong balance sheet.
￮ In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) business. We see continued strong demand for 
LNG, especially in Asia, and plan to grow our LNG business by 
20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. LNG provides energy 
security and flexibility because it can be easily transported to places 
where it is needed most. LNG is a critical fuel in the energy transition 
and plays an important role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal for 
industry, and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power 
in electricity generation.
￮ In Upstream, we continue to focus on more value and less emissions 
and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 
2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our 
world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our 
deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon 
barrels. As we work towards net-zero emissions, we will continue to 
approach capital and carbon allocation with discipline and focus. 
￮ In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are 
making clear choices and changes to enable this business to thrive 
through the energy transition. We are focusing on developing low-
carbon energy and solutions where we have competitive advantages 
and are starting to see increasing demand. We are focusing on 
value over volume across all our businesses in Downstream and 
Renewables and Energy Solutions, while driving both our emissions 
and our customers' emissions lower.
￮ We are repurposing our refining portfolio to focus on four regional 
Energy and Chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the
low-carbon hubs of the future producing biofuels and hydrogen. 
Our energy transition plans for this decade across our Downstream, 
Renewables and Energy Solutions business are focused on: growing 
our electric vehicle charging business; expanding our biofuels 
business; continuing to grow our integrated power positions, and 
developing technologies related to CCS and carbon removals.
See "Outlook" for more information on page 16.
Our research and development (R&D) activities are also key to 
achieving our net-zero emissions target. They are an important way 
to address the technology risk as mentioned in the "Transition risk 
and opportunities" section. 
In 2023, our R&D expenditure on projects that contributed to 
decarbonisation was around $628 million, representing about 
49% of our total R&D spend, compared with around 41% in 2022. 
This includes expenditure on reducing GHG emissions:
￮ from our own operations, for example, by improving energy 
efficiency and electrification; 
￮ from the fuels and other products we sell to our customers - for 
example, biofuels, synthetic fuels and products made from low-
carbon electricity, and hydrogen produced using renewable sources;
￮ by carbon capture, utilisation and storage applied to hydrogen 
production from natural gas and other carbon emissions; 
￮ by researching nature-based solutions to offset emissions; and
￮ for our customers through renewable power generation, storage,
e-mobility and other electrification solutions.
Examples of R&D areas other than decarbonisation, include safety, 
performance products such as lubricants and polymers, automation 
and artificial intelligence. 
Decarbonising our value chains and operations
We will seek to base the decarbonisation of our value chains and 
operations on a deep understanding of the decarbonisation strategies 
and plans of our customers and users of our energy products. We are 
focused on decarbonising our own operations by:
￮ making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in 
new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, 
divesting assets, and reducing our production through the natural 
decline of existing oil and gas fields;
￮ improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
￮ transforming our remaining integrated refineries into low-carbon 
energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
￮ developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.
If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset 
any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation 
hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.
In October 2021, we set an interim target to achieve a 50% reduction 
in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control by 
2030 on a net basis, when compared with 2016.
We aim to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-operated assets 
by 2025 [A] and maintain methane emissions intensity for operated oil 
and gas assets below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions 
by 2030.

Supporting our customers in achieving net-zero emissions
Changes to the supply of energy products and decarbonising the 
energy system require structural changes in the end-use of energy. 
This requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment 
so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch 
to low- and zero-carbon energy. 
We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive 
strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory 
support from governments. The transport sector is the largest market for 
our oil products. We are building on our customer relationships and 
expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-
duty trucks, planes and ships. We want to become a world leader 
in charging for electric vehicles, and remain a world leader in biofuels 
as they become sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made 
from waste. By transforming our refineries into four regional energy 
and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production 
hubs of the future.
For example, in the transport sector, decarbonisation includes replacing 
internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles and converting 
heavy-duty transport to biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, 
renewable diesel, renewable gas and, in the future, hydrogen and its 
derivatives. In the industrial sector, LNG plays an important role as a 
lower-carbon alternative to oil- and coal-fired furnaces, and provides grid 
stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. Such 
structural changes will help to trigger transitions along the supply chain 
of individual sectors and across sectors, including the production of 
energy and emissions over time. The IEA estimates that these changes in 
the end-use of energy will require substantial investment. Under the IEA 
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, for every one US dollar spent 
on fossil fuels, a further $5.7 need to be spent on clean energy and 
a further $5.6 spent on efficiency and end-uses.
We will seek to change the mix of energy products we sell to our 
customers as their needs for energy change. Emissions resulting from 
customer use of our energy products make up the largest percentage 
of Shell's carbon emissions. We believe we can make the greatest 
contribution to the energy transition by helping to enable our customers 
to switch to low-carbon energy products and services. This is reflected 
in Shell's strategy to develop a portfolio that seeks to:
￮ develop low- and zero-carbon alternatives to traditional fuel, 
including biofuels, hydrogen, and other low- and zero-carbon gases;
￮ provide more electricity to customers, while also driving a shift to 
renewable electricity;
￮ work with customers across different sectors to help them 
decarbonise their use of energy, for example by substituting the 
use of coal with LNG; and
￮ address any remaining emissions from conventional fuels with 
solutions such as CCS and carbon credits.
We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the 
energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% 
by 2030, and 100% by 2050.
The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing 
the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. NCI 
measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, 
compared to a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas 
products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products -- such 
as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.
Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the NCI of the products we 
sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support 
of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions 
for change.
Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic 
shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power 
business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, 
Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of 
energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that 
is where our strengths lie.
In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are 
concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our 
focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this 
focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be 
lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our NCI 
target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the NCI 
of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against 
our previous target of a 20% reduction.
Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy 
transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% 
reduction in NCI.
We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use 
of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, 
Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported 
emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's 
climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in 
the world.
Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, 
such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move 
to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, 
LNG and biofuels.
Our approach to climate change emphasises the need to work 
collaboratively. We aim to make strategic alliances with customers, 
other companies and entire sectors so we and they can make 
profitable progress towards net zero. As a founding member of the 
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), we are part of a group of 12 
national and international energy companies. The OGCI supports the 
climate goals of the UN Paris Agreement and recognises that collective 
actions can help drive the energy transition. 
[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 
517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e 
in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 
8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being 
classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.

Energy transition in action - selection of portfolio changes and actions in 2023: 
Growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions
￮ Shell completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. 
We now operate one of the largest electric vehicle charging 
networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points 
across 31 states. We also acquired evpass, which 
owns Switzerland's largest network of electric vehicle 
charging stations.
￮ In China, we opened our largest electric vehicle charging station 
globally, which has 258 public fast-charging points partially 
powered by the station's solar photovoltaic panels.
￮ In Germany, we launched Hydrogen Pay-Per-Use, through which 
truck operators can hire hydrogen-fuelled trucks to explore 
transitioning their fleet from diesel to hydrogen and reduce 
their carbon emissions. 
￮ The Hollandse Kust Noord (HKN) wind park, built by 
CrossWind, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco, became 
operational. It will add 759 MW of renewable energy to the 
Dutch electricity grid after final commissioning.
￮ Shell completed the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the 
largest producers of RNG in Europe. This acquisition supports 
Shell's ambitions to build an integrated RNG value chain at 
global scale and to profitably grow its low-carbon offerings 
to customers across multiple sectors. 
￮ Shell announced a multi-year offtake agreement for sustainable 
aviation fuel with Montana Renewables, one of the largest 
sustainable aviation fuel producers in North America.
￮ Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in 
Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 
1.2 million tonnes of CO2 a year. The CO2 will be shipped from 
two of Orsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara 
ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. 
￮ Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three carbon storage 
appraisal licences in the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing 
round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three 
sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2 captured 
and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.
￮ Shell continued to build a high-grade portfolio of carbon credits. 
In the USA, we launched Greenline Climate with the Spatial 
Informatics Group to provide development services for projects 
generating forest carbon credits. We also invested in and 
partnered with carbon project developer Kateri to accelerate 
advanced grazing management practices to improve rangeland 
productivity and carbon sequestration. 
￮ We moved forward with our construction of Holland Hydrogen 1 
(HH1), which will be one of Europe's largest renewable 
hydrogen plant once operational in 2025. The renewable 
power for the electrolyser will come from HKN. The renewable 
hydrogen produced will supply the Shell Energy and Chemicals 
Park Rotterdam, helping to decarbonise products like petrol, 
diesel and jet fuel. In the future, renewable hydrogen could also 
help cut emissions from commercial road transport.
Reducing emissions from our own operations 
￮ In the US Gulf of Mexico, we are the leading operator and 
have one of the lowest greenhouse gas intensities in the world 
for producing oil, compared with those of other oil and gas 
producing members of the International Association of Oil & 
Gas Producers. Our latest Shell-operated development, Vito 
(Shell interest 63.1%), started production in 2023. Vito is a third 
the size of its original design, which will reduce its emissions by 
around 80% over its operating life. We are using the same 
design concept for our Shell-operated Whale (Shell interest 
60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%) projects in the US Gulf of 
Mexico, which are expected to start production in 2024 and 
2028 respectively. Sparta will also feature all-electric topside 
compression equipment, significantly reducing greenhouse 
gas intensity and emissions from our own operations. 
￮ We delivered first gas from the Timi platform in Malaysia, which 
is powered by solar and wind. This unmanned platform is also 
more cost efficient, since it is around 60% lighter in weight than 
a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform that 
relies on oil and gas for power.
￮ We started to build the Rosmari-Marjoram gas project, which 
will be partially powered by 240 solar panels. 
￮ We are continuing to transform our refining business as part 
of our drive to create more value with less emissions. In early 
2024, we announced our investment decision to convert the 
hydrocracker at our Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland in 
Germany into a unit that will produce premium base oils, used 
to make high-quality lubricants, such as engine and transmission 
oils. The hydrocracker at the Wesseling site near Cologne will 
stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. 
The planned changes are expected to reduce Shell's Scope 1 
and 2 carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year.
￮ The final investment decision was taken to build Porthos, 
Europe's largest CCS facility, at the port of Rotterdam, starting 
in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million 
tonnes of CO2 a year.

Climate risk management
Shell's processes for identifying and assessing
climate-related risks
Identifying climate-related risks
Shell considers climate change and the energy transition a material risk 
factor. We monitor the risks related to these across four components:
￮ commercial risks;
￮ regulatory risks;
￮ societal risks (including litigation risk); and 
￮ physical risks.
These components are monitored and assessed on an integrated 
basis, necessitated by the interdependence of the risks and the related 
actions. The different components pose different kinds of exposures 
spanning different time horizons. Similarly, the responses to the 
components of the risk are also planned by taking a holistic view. Our 
integrated approach to risk management and the resulting changes 
in our strategy ensure we manage our aggregate climate change risk 
within our overall risk appetite over different time horizons.
For example, the increasing cost of complying with emission limits
in some regions is a regulatory risk that may require operational 
responses in the near term. The reduction in demand for legacy 
hydrocarbons is a commercial risk that may have a medium- to long-
term impact, demanding changes to our strategic portfolio and 
business models. The risk of physical impacts of climate change may 
occur in the short, medium and long term and may require actions
to mitigate adverse impacts on our assets and supply chain. As an 
example, the transformation of our refineries into energy and chemicals 
parks reduces the level of our operational emissions and medium-
to long-term commercial risks, allowing us to plan for future
adaptation measures. 
Shell's processes for identifying and assessing risks are part of the 
Shell Performance Framework.
Our risk management procedures that help us identify climate-related 
risks and opportunities include:
￮ monitoring external developments, including policy changes and 
new regulations;
￮ evaluating the status of risk indicators, which illustrate how well 
we are managing each component of the risk related to climate 
change and the energy transition; and
￮ learning from incidents and assurance findings.
We use these procedures to identify risks and determine their 
significance, both individually and relative to other risks.
Assessing climate-related risks
For each identified risk, we evaluate its impact, likelihood and the level 
of risk we are willing to accept.
When assessing the likelihood of a risk occurring, we consider factors 
such as our ability to prevent the risk happening and whether the risk 
has materialised in the past.
We consider the financial consequences and how it might affect our 
reputation, our ability to comply with regulations, and possible damage 
to health, safety, our assets and the environment. The impact, and 
hence materiality, of a risk is based on how critical it could be to 
our business model. For example, as we operate in multiple countries, 
societal risks are material to our licence to operate.
The impact and likelihood assessment helps us to prioritise risks and 
determine their relative materiality, based on a comprehensive picture 
of significant risks to any relevant business objectives.
To support our risk assessments, we seek to establish the level of 
risk that we are willing to accept in pursuit of Shell's strategy and 
objectives. We consider the amount of resources – such as financial 
resources, people, processes, systems and controls – that we are 
willing and able to allocate to manage each risk in pursuit of our 
objectives and the impact for Shell's overall risk profile.
The impact and likelihood assessment, combined with risk appetite, 
determines the type of risk responses, such as controls and assurance 
activities, that may be required to manage each risk.
Possible responses include:
￮ accepting the risk without any further action;
￮ mitigating or reducing the risk with appropriate controls, supported 
by assurance activities;
￮ transferring the risk, for example to insurance providers where 
appropriate; and 
￮ altogether stopping or forgoing the activity that gives rise to the risk.
In determining our risk responses, we always seek to comply with
our Code of Conduct and other boundaries, such as our financial 
framework, which set the aggregate level of risk appetite that could
be sustained. The Financial Framework considers boundaries such
as our net debt levels and our credit rating.
Classifications of risks
We identify and define risks across the spectrum of strategic, 
operational, and conduct and culture risks. With strategic risks 
we consider current and future portfolio issues, examining 
parameters such as country concentration or exposure to 
higher-risk countries. We also consider long-range 
developments to test key assumptions or beliefs in relation to 
energy markets. When assessing operational risks, we consider 
material operational exposures across Shell's entire value chain 
which provides a more granular assessment of key risks facing 
the organisation. For conduct and culture risks we consider how 
our policies and practices align with our purpose, core values 
and desired mindset and behaviours.
Against the above categories, we assess the four sub-
components of risk related to climate change and the energy 
transition – commercial, regulatory, societal (including 
litigation) and physical risks. This helps us maintain strategic 
resilience, robust operational risk responses and alignment 
of our responses with Shell's purpose and core values.
Shell's processes for managing climate-related risks
On an ongoing basis, our assets leverage broad risk and threat 
management processes to identify and respond to emerging challenges 
to their ongoing safe, compliant and efficient operation, including 
climate-related risk, as required by our HSSE & SP Control Framework. 
Our risk management processes are carried out at the Group, business, 
function and asset level, which includes projects.
We apply the Shell Performance Framework to ensure that we 
effectively manage our climate-related risks at all these levels. 
The Framework includes:
￮ mandatory standards and manuals;
￮ project-level risk management processes;
￮ management and Board reviews;
￮ internal audits; and
￮ annual assurance letter process.
Strategic Report | Performance in the year
Our journey to net zero continued
98 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 100 ----
Mandatory standards and manuals
Our climate change risk management approach is supported by 
standards and manuals as part of our HSSE & SP Control Framework. 
They provide guidance on how to monitor, communicate and report 
changes in the risk environment. These documents aim to:
￮ ensure consistent management and assessment of climate risk
across Shell; 
￮ clarify expectations for risk management and reporting, 
including roles and responsibilities of the risk owners;
￮ clarify types of assurance activities that may be applicable; 
￮ strengthen decision-making by ensuring that businesses have better 
awareness and understanding of climate risks (including their 
likelihood and potential impact) and mitigation plans; and 
￮ enable integration of Shell's reporting.
We periodically review and, if necessary, update our standards and 
manuals in light of developments in risks, including those associated 
with climate change. We are in the process of transitioning to new 
Safety, Environment & Asset Management Standards as part of the 
Shell Performance Framework. Our approach continues to evolve as 
we increase our understanding of changing policies and the differing 
pace of energy transition in different regions.
Project-level risk management processes
At a project level, assessing climate-related risks is an important part
of making initial investment decisions. Projects of a certain size or
which carry unusual risks are required to follow Shell's Opportunity 
Realisation Standard, which sets out the rules for managing and 
delivering opportunities in the organisation. Each project is assisted
by experts from our global subject matter groups during its 
development, implementation and operation.
Projects under development that are expected to have a material 
GHG impact must meet our internal carbon performance standards 
or industry benchmarks. An exception process is in place to manage 
specific incidental cases. Performance standards are under 
development for power and hydrogen projects. Our performance 
standards are used for measuring a project's average lifetime GHG 
intensity or energy efficiency per asset type. Projects with a material 
GHG footprint that meet the performance standards or industry 
benchmarks will often set more ambitious emissions targets for 
themselves. GHG abatement plans help determine the nature of these 
targets, and we assess the effects of a project's emissions alongside 
economic and technical design factors. Applying these criteria ensures 
that our projects can compete and prosper in the energy transition.
The performance standards are approved by the Executive Vice 
President accountable for implementation in the relevant businesses, 
and by the Executive Vice President Safety, Environment and 
Asset Management.
We assess the future GHG emissions of projects against performance 
standards and by considering the GHG emissions from the use of the 
products that are to be manufactured. These assessments can lead 
to projects being stopped or designs being changed.
We expect the performance standards to evolve as our portfolio 
changes in the energy transition.
Management and Board reviews
Climate change matters and risks resulting from GHG emissions are 
reviewed and managed in line with other significant risks through the 
Board and EC. Management, the Board and Board committees review 
the risk of climate change and the energy transition to understand and 
assess emerging issues that may impact our strategy or our responses 
to this risk at an operational level. For example, as part of the annual 
planning cycle, the EC and the Board assess how climate change and 
GHG emissions may affect the pace of the energy transition, business 
emission reduction plans and the implications for Shell's current portfolio. 
We have established several dedicated internal forums related 
to climate change and the energy transition. These are at different 
levels of the organisation and seek to address, monitor and review 
climate change issues. 
In addition, each business and function regularly reviews its risk profile, 
risk responses and assurance activities throughout the year to ensure 
climate-related risks are managed effectively. These insights are used 
to provide management with updates on the operational management 
of climate change and the energy transition risks. During these updates, 
business and functions management review whether our risk responses 
are effective in addressing the four sub-components of the climate 
change and energy transition risk. These reviews help us to update 
Shell's plans and guide our day-to-day operational decisions such 
as maintenance schedules and our risk response plans.
Internal audit process
Shell's Internal Audit and Investigations (SIAI) team provides independent 
and objective assurance and advises management and the Board on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls. 
For example, SIAI conducted five audits during 2023 that included the 
testing of controls related to GHG emissions measurement, reporting, 
forecasting and abatement projects. 
Annual assurance letter process
Each member of the EC must submit an annual assurance letter to the 
CEO that their business's or function's activities have been conducted 
in accordance with the requirements set out in the HSSE & SP Control 
Framework. This assurance includes the assessment of the effectiveness 
of the internal controls in managing climate- and energy-transition-
related risks. 
Integration of the climate-related risk management
process into Shell's overall risk management
Our climate-related risk management process follows the approach set 
out by the Shell Performance Framework, ensuring that it is integrated 
into the overall risk management processes of the Group.
Climate-related risks are considered from a strategic and operational 
perspective to ensure we maintain a comprehensive view of the 
different types of climate risks we face and the different time horizons 
in which they may affect us. The monitoring and review of risks is a 
key risk management process in Shell. 
The EC, the Board and Board committees review climate-related risks 
and their impact on the Group. This allows management to take a 
holistic view and optimise risk mitigation responses, to ensure that 
climate-related risk responses are properly integrated into the 
relevant activities.

Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland
We are continuing to transform our refining business as part of our 
drive to create more value with less emissions. Shell announced 
plans in January 2024 to convert the hydrocracker at its Energy 
and Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany into a unit that will 
produce premium base oils, used to make high-quality lubricants, 
such as engine and transmission oils. 
The Wesseling site near Cologne will stop processing crude oil into 
petrol, diesel and jet fuel by 2025, and the plant will have a high 
degree of electrification. These changes are expected to reduce 
Shell's Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes 
a year.
The new base oil plant is expected to start operations in the second 
half of this decade. It will have a production capacity of around 
300,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to about 9% of current EU 
demand and 40% of Germany's demand for base oils.
This investment, financed by Shell's Chemicals and Products 
business, meets the minimum acceptable internal rate of return 
set out at our Capital Markets Day in 2023. It is the latest key 
development in the transformation of the Energy and Chemicals 
Park Rheinland. We are already investing in a 10-megawatt 
electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane 
liquefaction plant.

Climate-related metrics and targets
Metrics used by Shell to assess climate-related risks
and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk 
management process
This section describes our performance and progress in respect of our 
climate-related targets, including those reflected in the remuneration 
of senior management and employees. 
Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business 
by 2050. We have set intensity targets and absolute targets 
and ambitions over the short, medium and long term to track 
our performance over time (as summarised below). The targets are 
forward-looking targets based on management's current expectations 
and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to 
differ materially from those expressed or implied herein.
We believe our total net absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 
1.73 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e). 
In October 2021, in support of our 2050 net-zero emissions target, 
we set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets 
and activities under our operational control (including divestments) by 
50% by 2030 compared with the 2016 baseline, on a net basis. We aim 
to maintain methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets 
below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. We aim 
to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-operated assets by 2025 [A].
[A] Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.
We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the 
energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% 
by 2030, and 100% by 2050.
The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing 
the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. NCI 
measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, 
compared to a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas 
products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products -- such 
as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.
Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the NCI of the products we sell 
requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of 
governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.
Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift 
in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, 
including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and 
the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes 
in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.
In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are 
concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our 
focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this 
focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be 
lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our NCI 
target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the NCI 
of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against 
our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in 
the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to 
retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in NCI.
We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use 
of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, 
Category 11) [B]. This level of ambition is in line with the European 
Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most 
progressive in the world.
Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such 
as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric 
mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.
[B] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million 
tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
We monitor our progress against these targets and ambitions using 
the key metrics described.

under our operational control using the market-based method. It includes imported energy 
used for production of energy and non-energy products.
[C] Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3, Categories 1, 3, 9 and 11) based on the energy product 
sales included in NCI using equity boundary. There was a decrease in reported volumes 
associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes with 
effect from January 2020. We estimate that netting of oil products sales volumes resulted 
in a reduction in GHG emissions of around 73 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 compared 
with 2016. 
[D] Emissions are reported gross without the inclusion of carbon credits.
[E] Oil and gas industry guidelines from IPIECA indicate that several sources of uncertainty can 
contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated 
the overall uncertainty for our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) to be around 4% and for our 
energy indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) to be around 8% for the market-based method 
and 7% for the location-based method for 2023. IPIECA also notes that due to the diversity 
of Scope 3 emissions, sources and the fact that these emissions occur outside the company's 
boundaries, the emissions estimates may be less accurate or may have a high uncertainty.
[F] Figures disclosed are rounded. Rounding differences can occur between the total 
combined Scope 1 and 2 absolute GHG emissions disclosed in this Report and the sum 
of its components individually rounded to the nearest million tonnes.
[G] Acquisitions and divestments have been included in the actual performance tracking with 
the target unchanged. Note that acquisitions and divestments could have a material 
impact on meeting the targets.
Drivers of Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) 
decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 
in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors 
including: 
￮ divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia 
Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC 
and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations 
in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022;
￮ unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals);
￮ reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration 
and Production Company (SNEPCo);
￮ reduction activities (see examples in the list of energy efficiency 
projects on page 113) and purchase of renewable electricity. 
These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having 
more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from Pearl and Prelude 
with increased production.
Total routine flaring [A]
Million tonnes
2023 2022 2021 2016
Total hydrocarbons flared in routine flaring 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.1
[A] Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production if it is not possible to use the gas 
or reinject it into the well.
Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained 
relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, 
having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.
Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated 
Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by 
the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) 
and SNEPCo. 
On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to 
Renaissance, a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by 
the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions. SPDC will 
continue to operate the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV [A]) on behalf 
of all the joint-venture partners, who together will continue to make 
decisions relating to work programmes for the SPDC JV's assets 
and infrastructure. This includes work programmes to eliminate 
routine flaring.
[A] The SPDC JV comprises SPDC Ltd (30%), the government-owned NNPC (55%), Total 
Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd (10%) and Nigeria Agip Oil Company Ltd (5%).

emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.
[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that 
do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane 
emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.
[C] Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated 
Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions assets, 
quantified according to industry best practice. 
Our target to keep methane emissions intensity below 0.2% was met in 
2023 with Shell's overall methane emissions intensity at 0.05% for facilities 
with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. 
In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes 
compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due 
to venting (e.g. the maintenance of our Floating LNG Prelude asset 
and operational issues in assets operated by Sarawak Shell Berhad) 
and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets 
in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source-level 
measurements in line with The Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 
(OGMP) reporting requirements.
We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry 
best practice. Methane emissions include those from unintentional 
leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares 
and turbines.

Scope 3 and net carbon intensity
NCI performance
In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous 
year and a 6.3% reduction compared with the 2016 baseline. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction 
in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid 
decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe and partly by increased sales of renewable power including the retirement 
of Renewable Energy Certificates.

meeting the targets.
[C] Volume of energy products sold, aggregated on an energy basis, with power represented as fossil equivalent. Energy products consist of energy oil products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, fuel 
oil and LPG), GTL, biofuels, liquefied natural gas, pipeline gas and power. The NCI calculation uses energy product sales volumes data, disclosed in this Report where relevant. These sales 
volumes exclude certain contracts held for trading purposes and reported net rather than gross. Business-specific methodologies have been applied to net volumes of oil products, pipeline gas 
and power. Paper trades that do not result in physical product delivery are excluded. Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark licensing agreements are not 
included in the sales volumes reported by Shell and are therefore excluded from the scope of Shell´s NCI metric.
[D] These numbers include well-to-wheel emissions associated with energy products sold, on an equity boundary basis; they also include the well-to-tank emissions associated with the 
manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded. 
[E] While the NCI is an intensity measure and not an inventory of absolute emissions, a notional estimate of the amount of GHG emissions covered by the scope of the NCI calculation can be derived 
from the final NCI value for any year. Similarly, a fossil-equivalent estimate of the total amount of energy sold included in the calculation can also be determined.
As part of our Powering Progress strategy, we aim to increase the share 
of low-carbon products in our energy product sales, which is the 
biggest driver for reducing our NCI.
 
Share of estimated total energy delivered per energy

[A] Percentage of delivered energy may not add up to 100% because of rounding.
[B] Total volume of energy products sold, aggregated on an energy basis (lower heating 
value) with power represented as fossil equivalents. Emissions included in the carbon 
intensity of power have been calculated using the market-based method. The carbon 
intensity of biofuels reflects the global average for biofuels sold in 2023.
Our ability to change the emissions intensity of each energy product 
varies depending on the product type: 
￮ Hydrocarbon fuels - emissions from end-use by customers are by 
far the biggest contributors to the carbon intensity of the product. 
As a result, the emissions intensity of hydrocarbon fuels is expected 
to stay relatively unchanged over time. This is why we are focused 
on helping our customers decarbonise.
￮ Biofuels - can vary significantly in intensity depending on the 
feedstock and production process used. 
￮ Power - the emissions intensity of power can be highly variable 
depending on how it has been generated. The proportion of our 
renewable power sales and the generation mix in countries where 
we sell power to the market both affect Shell's overall power mix 
and its resulting emissions intensity.

Drivers of absolute Scope 3 emissions change in 2023 
We sell more energy products than the energy products we produce 
ourselves, therefore, when we calculate our emissions, we include 
emissions from energy products that we produce ourselves as well 
as from the products that we purchase from others for resale. This 
is reflected in the scope for calculation of our emissions shown in 
the chart on page 109. Our strategy is based on working with our 
customers to address the emissions from the use of our products and 
to help them find ways to reduce their emissions to net zero by 2050.

[B] An estimate of Scope 3, Category 9 was not performed in 2016.
[C] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 
million tonnes CO2e in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes 
CO2e in 2016.
The reported Scope 3 emissions within the NCI boundary have 
reduced from 2022. The decrease is largely due to a reduction in sales 
of gas and refined oil products. Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions for our 
sales of power were comparable year on year as we sold more power 
but at a lower average intensity in 2023 compared with 2022.
Scope 3 emissions from categories 1, 3 and 11 make up the majority 
of Shell's Scope 3 emissions under the equity boundary. Shell reports 
Scope 3 emissions across all 15 categories annually. 
For further details see shell.com/ghg
We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. 
Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under 
our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our 
energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified 
to a level of limited assurance by LRQA Group Limited.
Targets used by Shell to manage climate-related risks 
and opportunities and performance against targets
Shell's material climate-related risks and opportunities are set out in
the "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over 
the short, medium and long term" section. Our response to the energy 
transition risk focuses on decarbonising our value chain. Our climate 
targets are focused on reducing our NCI and our absolute emissions, 
as presented on pages 101-102.
Setting targets for NCI 
Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 
2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce 
the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, measured using our 
NCI metric. We believe these targets are aligned with the more 
ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in 
global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels.
There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's 
decarbonisation targets within the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris 
Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our NCI target using 
1.5°C scenarios developed for the IPCC's AR6.
We start with the complete set of 1.5°C scenarios and then exclude 
scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy 
before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for 
each scenario which is comparable to our own NCI. Finally, we 
produce a 1.5°C pathway based on the reductions in emissions 
intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any 
individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the 
energy transition. 
We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates 
that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris 
Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.
We also believe that the pace of change will vary around the world 
by region and by sector, taking into consideration the time needed 
for energy users to invest in large-scale equipment and the energy 
infrastructure changes needed for Shell to deliver more low- and
zero-carbon energy.

Scope 1 and 2 progress towards target
The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 
1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve 
our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will 
depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued 
development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. We 
expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our 
portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 
2030, but this increase will be outweighed by reductions associated 
with planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in 
producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions, while reducing the NCI of the products we sell. 
Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms 
outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 
2030. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:
￮ making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments 
in new, low-carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, 
divesting assets, and reducing our production through the natural 
decline of existing oil and gas fields;
￮ improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
￮ transforming our remaining integrated refineries into low-carbon 
energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
￮ developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.
If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset 
any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation 
hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.

NCI progress towards target
The biggest driver for reducing our NCI is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart below illustrates how changes 
in the volume of products and services we sell could result in NCI reductions to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services 
will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage 
the energy transition.
Working to reduce our NCI

[A] Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.
[B] Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. 
[C] Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. 
[D] Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. 
[E] CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. 
[F] Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement 
and steel.
Linking Shell's emissions targets to remuneration 
We have established remuneration structures to support us in reducing 
our operational emissions and to support customers in reducing their 
emissions. Our annual bonus scorecard, Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
and Performance Share Plan (PSP) contain "Shell's journey in the 
energy transition" performance metrics designed to ensure that 
remuneration is clearly aligned with Shell's operating plan and
longer-term strategic ambitions. 
See "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 174-176.
Almost all employees participate in the annual bonus scheme which 
is linked to the Group scorecard. Executive Directors and around 130 
senior executives participate in the LTIP and around 17,800 employees 
participate in the PSP, which is designed to retain key employees and 
ensure they have a greater investment in Shell's future. 
The LTIP and the PSP measure performance over a three-year 
performance period. Executive Directors' awards are also subject to 
a further three-year holding period after vesting. Executive Directors 
and senior executives are also subject to ongoing shareholding 
requirements. 
Energy transition performance condition and the vesting 
of the 2021 LTIP and PSP awards
The following performance outcomes for the energy transition 
performance condition were considered in the assessment of the
2021 LTIP and PSP vest, covering the performance cycle 2021-2023:
Outcome
Net carbon intensity (NCI) Performance indicator met
Growing the power business Substantively met
Growing new lower-carbon product offerings  Partially met
Develop emissions sinks  Not met
In addition to the above, a number of broader indicators of Shell's 
progress in the energy transition were considered. Overall, it was 
determined that the energy transition measure (accounting for 20%
of the LTIP award and 10% of the PSP award) should vest at 120%.
See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on pages 182-185.

Energy transition performance condition in the 2023 LTIP 
and PSP awards
For LTIP and PSP awards granted in 2023, the energy transition 
performance condition had a weighting of 12.5% for the PSP and 25% 
for the LTIP. The performance condition for these awards is based on 
NCI reduction and the supporting strategic themes of reducing Scope 1 
and 2 emissions; building a renewable power business; growing new 
low-carbon energy offerings; and developing emission sinks and offsets. 
The vesting outcome is at the discretion of the REMCO who will make 
a holistic assessment of progress when making the vesting decisions. 
Energy transition performance condition for 2024 LTIP awards 
For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, the "Shell's journey in the energy 
transition" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 
2023. The REMCO's determination of the extent to which awards 
will vest will be based on its holistic assessment of progress towards 
reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers 
to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero 
climate targets for our own operations of:
￮ Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control 
on a net basis (2016 baseline); 
￮ Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; 
and 
￮ Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving 
near-zero methane emissions by 2030. 
The REMCO will also take into account progress in developments 
that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the 
development of our Power business (including renewables), lower-
carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and 
carbon capture and storage (CCS).
[A] Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.
The REMCO will take into account progress towards achieving a 
15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% 
reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 
2030 (2021 baseline) [A] as well as Shell's wider performance in 
accelerating the energy transition, e.g. demonstrating leadership and 
advocacy in standard-setting, alongside any other factors that the 
REMCO considers material.
[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 
517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on page 192 for more information on the 
proposed performance framework.
Energy transition targets in the annual bonus scorecard 
Delivering on our net-zero emissions target is a part of the annual 
scorecard, which helps determine annual performance bonus outcomes 
for senior management and almost all of Shell's employees.

and earnings from convenience retail.
The 2023 full-year outcome for selling lower-carbon products was 
below target (but above threshold level) for a range of reasons 
including lower lubricants demand and higher costs for lower-carbon 
Mobility products. 
In 2023, the outcome for operational emissions reductions was 
outstanding, reflecting the cumulative effects of actions across the 
portfolio, which support our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 operational 
emissions by 2030 (when compared to the 2016 baseline). This 
includes abatement projects, use of renewable energy, and permanent 
shutdowns or conversions ("right-sizing") of assets.
We are building an electric vehicle charging business to help 
decarbonise road transport. In 2023 we opened 60 new electric 
vehicle charging hubs in Belgium, China, Germany and the 
Netherlands, including our biggest electric vehicle charging site in 
the world in China, together with our joint-venture partner BYD.
In 2024, the REMCO has adjusted the energy transition measure in 
our annual scorecard in light of the energy transition strategy update, 
continuing to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy 
transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, 
while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric 
"Shell's journey in the energy transition" in the annual bonus scorecard 
represents: 
￮ LNG volumes – equity liquefaction;

See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on page 181.
Metrics and targets in respect of climate-related 
environmental risks
We have set a target to reduce the amount of fresh water consumed 
in our facilities, starting by reducing our consumption of fresh water by 
15% by 2025, compared with 2018 levels, in areas where there is high 
pressure on fresh-water resources. We also monitor the level of waste 
disposed of from our operations and businesses are now setting local 
waste management targets and developing implementation plans 
based on waste and circularity assessments that we have conducted. 
In 2023, we continued to implement our biodiversity commitments in 
our projects and assets, with critical and forest habitats as priorities.

Basis of preparation – net carbon intensity (NCI)
Shell's NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volumes, 
of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and 
reported using the Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. 
We have received third-party limited assurance on our NCI for the 
period 2016 to 2023. 
Scope of NCI

Our journey to net zero continued
109 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 111 ----
Shell's NCI provides an annual measure of the life-cycle emissions 
intensity of the portfolio of energy products sold. The intended use 
of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon 
intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. The NCI is calculated 
on a life-cycle basis and as such includes GHG emissions – on an 
equity basis – from several sources, including: 
￮ direct GHG emissions from Shell operations;
￮ indirect GHG emissions from generation of energy consumed 
by Shell; and
￮ indirect GHG emissions from the use of the products we sell.
Emissions from other parts of the product life cycle are also included, 
such as those from the extraction, transport and processing of crude 
oil, gas or other feedstocks and the distribution of products to our 
customers. Also included are emissions from parts of this life cycle not 
owned by Shell, such as the extraction of oil and gas processed by 
Shell but not produced by Shell; or from the production of oil products 
and electricity marketed by Shell that have not been processed or 
generated at a Shell facility.
We also take into account emissions mitigated through various 
measures, such as by creating carbon sinks by working with nature – 
including through protecting forests and wetlands – and by using 
CCS technology.
See "Scope of NCI" on page 109 for details of the supply chains and steps in the product 
life cycles that are included in the Net Carbon Footprint methodology.
The following GHG emissions are not included in the NCI:
￮ emissions from production, processing, use and end-of-life treatment 
of non-energy products, such as chemicals and lubricants;
￮ emissions from third-party processing of sold intermediate products, 
such as the manufacture of plastics from feedstocks sold by Shell;
￮ emissions associated with the construction and decommissioning of 
production and manufacturing facilities;
￮ emissions associated with the production of fuels purchased to 
generate energy on site at a Shell facility;
￮ other indirect emissions from waste generated in operations, business 
travel, employee commuting, transmission and distribution losses 
associated with imported electricity, franchises and investments; and
￮ emissions from capital goods, defined by the GHG Protocol as 
including fixed assets or property, plant and equipment, and other 
goods and services not related to purchased energy feedstocks 
sourced from third parties or energy products manufactured by 
third parties and sold by Shell.
The NCI calculation uses Shell's energy product sales volumes data, 
as disclosed in this Report. This excludes certain sales volumes such as:
￮ certain contracts held for trading purposes reported net rather than 
gross. Business-specific methodologies to net volumes have been 
applied in oil products and pipeline gas and power. Paper trades 
that do not result in physical product delivery are excluded; and 
￮ retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under 
trademark licensing agreements.
The energy products included in the NCI calculation are oil products, 
(gasoline, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil and LPG), GTL, biofuels, liquefied 
natural gas, pipeline gas and power. 
The impact of acquisitions and divestments on emissions and sales 
volumes is included in actual NCI performance tracking with the target 
and baseline unchanged. Acquisitions and divestments could have 
a material impact on meeting the NCI targets.
The NCI is not a mathematical derivation of total emissions divided 
by total energy, nor is it an inventory of absolute emissions. It is a 
weighted average of the life-cycle CO2 intensities of different energy 
products, normalising them to the same point relative to their final end-
use. The use of a consistent functional unit, grams of carbon dioxide 
equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ), allows like-for-like comparisons 
and the aggregation of individual life-cycle intensities for a range of 
energy products including renewables.
See our NCF methodology documentation (shell.com/ghg) for further information.
Basis of preparation – absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions
We follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of GHG emissions:
￮ Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources under Shell's 
operational control.
￮ Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from generation of purchased 
energy consumed by Shell assets under operational control.
￮ Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions 
associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.
GHG emissions comprise CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and 
nitrogen trifluoride, with CO2 and methane being the most significant 
contributors. Our GHG inventory was prepared in line with the 
requirements outlined in the ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with 
Guidance at the Organisational Level for Quantification and Reporting 
of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals and the GHG Protocol's 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
In line with external standards, Shell aggregates its GHG emissions 
into tonnes of CO2 equivalent by applying global warming potential 
(GWP) factors to non-CO2 GHGs. These factors are taken from the 
IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) over a 100-year time period, in 
line with the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting. GHG emissions for 2023 were calculated using AR5 GWPs, 
which were applied prospectively. For comparison our Scope 1 
emissions would have been 49 million tonnes in 2023 if we were to 
have used GWPs from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).
GHG emissions are aggregated using a bottom-up approach: emission 
s o u r c e  →  a s s e t  →  o p e r a t i n g  u n i t  →  b u s i n e s s  →  G r o u p .  G H G  e m i s s i o n s  
in this Report include emissions from Integrated Gas and Upstream, 
Renewables and Energy Solutions and Downstream (Chemicals and 
Products and Marketing) and Projects & Technology, plus Shell's 
functions. All operated assets are included in the GHG inventory
in the reporting period.
Basis of preparation – Scope 1 emissions
Sources included in Scope 1 emissions comprised: 
￮ combustion of carbon-containing fuels in stationary equipment
(e.g. boilers, gas turbines) for energy generation; 
￮ combustion of carbon-containing fuels in mobile equipment
(e.g. trucks, vessels, mobile rigs);
￮ flares;
￮ venting and emissions from industrial processes (e.g. hydrogen 
plants, catalytic cracking units); and 
￮ fugitive emissions, including piping and equipment leaks and
non-routine events.

---- Page 112 ----
Our Scope 1 emissions follow the GHG Protocol guidance. As a result,
the following were not included in our reported Scope 1 emissions:
￮ CO2 emissions from biogenic sources (for example, biofuels, 
biomass), whereas methane and nitrous oxide emissions from 
biogenic sources were included in our Scope 1 emissions. 
￮ Captured CO2 that was subsequently sold or otherwise transferred 
to third parties.
￮ CO2 captured and sequestered using CCS technologies. However, 
the emissions from operating CCS were included in our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions. 
￮ Carbon credits.
All significant sources were included in the Scope 1 inventory. 
Basis of preparation – Scope 2 emissions
Sources included in Scope 2 emissions comprised indirect emissions 
from purchased and consumed electricity, steam and heat. We did not 
identify any assets with imported cooling or compressed air used for 
energy purposes. 
Scope 2 emissions were calculated using the market- and location-
based methods separately as defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance. 
All significant sources were included in our Scope 2 inventory. 
Basis of preparation - Scope 3 emissions
This Report provides Scope 3 emissions associated with our energy 
product sales. They were consolidated using the equity boundary 
approach. Under this approach, we reported the Shell share of 
emissions from energy products sold, including those sourced from 
third parties. The calculation of Scope 3 emissions uses energy product 
sales volumes data, disclosed in this Report where relevant. These sales 
volumes exclude certain contracts held for trading purposes and 
reported net rather than gross. Business-specific methodologies have 
been applied to net volumes of oil products, pipeline gas and power. 
Paper trades that do not result in physical product delivery are 
excluded. Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates 
under trademark licensing agreements are not included in the sales 
volumes reported by Shell and are therefore excluded from the 
Scope 3 categories described below. 
Scope 3 categories included in this Report consist of the following:
Scope 3, Category 1: purchased goods and services
This category includes well-to-tank emissions from purchased third-party 
unfinished and finished energy products excluding electricity (which 
was reported separately under Category 3: fuel and energy-related 
activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2)).
Emissions in this category were estimated using well-to-tank emission 
factors for crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products (such as gasoline, 
and diesel), LNG and biofuels. Because the emission factors include 
transport, we did not estimate emissions from transport of purchased 
third-party products separately. 
Emissions from purchased non-energy products were not included in 
this Report. 
Scope 3, Category 3: fuel and energy-related activities 
(not included in Scope 1 and 2)
This category includes well-to-wire emissions from purchased third-party 
electricity sold by Shell, calculated using the market-based method. 
Emissions were not adjusted for any potential double-counting of sold 
natural gas that may have been used for generating this electricity.
This category does not include:
￮ indirect emissions from generation of imported energy (steam, 
heat or electricity consumed by our assets). These emissions 
were reported separately as Scope 2 emissions; and
￮ well-to-tank emissions from purchased electricity, steam and heat 
consumed by our assets (i.e. Scope 3 emissions from extraction, 
refining and transport of primary fuels before their use in the 
generation of electricity or steam).
Scope 3, Category 9: downstream transport and distribution
This category includes estimated emissions from transport and 
distribution of energy products produced or refined by Shell. It does not 
include the emissions associated with transporting third-party products, 
which are included in Scope 3, Category 1. In order to avoid double-
counting the emissions from transport, Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 
transport included in our equity emissions were subtracted from the 
total in this category.
Scope 3, Category 11: use of sold products
This category includes estimated emissions from the use of sold 
energy products, such as LNG, GTL, pipeline gas, refined oil products 
and biofuels. The emissions consist of two sub-categories: products 
manufactured and sold by Shell and third-party products sold by Shell.
This category does not include non-energy products that may have 
been combusted during use (for example, lubricants).
Biogenic CO2 emissions from combustion of sold biofuels
Biogenic CO2 emissions from the combustion of sold biofuels were 
estimated and reported separately outside of scopes. Methane 
and nitrous oxide were included in Scope 3, Category 11 in line 
with the ISO 14064-1:2018 and GHG Protocol requirements.
We did not estimate biogenic CO2 emissions in other Scope 3 
categories. It is assumed that the presence of biogenic emissions 
in other categories is negligible at present.
Other Scope 3 categories
As noted above, this Report only covers Scope 3 GHG emissions 
associated with our energy product sales.
See our website: shell.com/ghg for other Scope 3 GHG emissions.

GHG emissions and energy consumption data - 
information provided in accordance with UK regulations
Data in this section are consolidated using the operational control 
approach. Under this approach, we account for 100% of the GHG 
emissions and energy consumption in respect of activities where
we are the operator, irrespective of our ownership percentage. 
Reporting on this operational control basis differs from that applied
for financial reporting purposes in the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements". We acknowledge the strong preference of the UK's 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for companies to report the
GHG emissions and energy consumption data using the financial 
consolidation boundary and are working on including the data
and information on this boundary in our Annual Report in the future.

Energy use in our operations 
The energy consumption data provided below comprise own energy, 
generated and consumed by our facilities, and supplied energy 
(electricity, steam and heat) purchased by our facilities for our use. 
Energy consumption data reflect primary (thermal) energy (e.g. the 
energy content of fuels used to generate electricity, steam, heat, 
mechanical energy, etc.). This includes energy from renewable and
non-renewable sources. Own energy generated was calculated by 
multiplying the volumes of fuels consumed for energy purposes by
their respective lower heating values. Own energy generated that was 
exported to third-party assets or to the power grid is excluded. Thermal 
energy for purchased and consumed electricity was calculated using 
actual electricity purchased multiplied by country-specific electricity 
generation efficiency factors (from IEA statistics). Thermal energy for 
purchased and consumed steam and heat was calculated from actual 
steam/heat purchased multiplied by a supplier-specific conversion 
efficiency, or a generic efficiency factor where supplier-specific 
data were not available.

[A] We have updated 2022 and 2021 figures following the review of data. 
In 2023, we implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy 
use and increase the energy efficiency of our operations.
Examples of some of the principal measures taken in 2023 to reduce 
energy use and improve efficiency (with estimated total savings of 
around 999 million kWh in 2023) are:
￮ At our Geismar site in the USA: idling the furnace when not required.
￮ At our Rheinland site in Germany: optimising the amount of steam 
required depending on use and load.
￮ At our Sarnia site in Canada: replacing an existing reaction furnace 
with a new high-intensity burner.
￮ At our Scotford complex in Canada: optimisation which enables 
a reduction in electricity and excess H2 vented to flare. 
￮ At our Prelude site in Australia: optimisation of the process and 
operating conditions to reduce flaring.
￮ At our Pearl site in Qatar: reducing steam generation requirements 
via steam balance optimisation.
￮ At our GTL asset in Malaysia: optimising fuel flows to the boiler unit.
￮ At our UK Upstream operations: reducing compression power 
requirements between our Shearwater platform and St Fergus 
gas terminal.
￮ At our Gulf of Mexico operations in the USA: optimising power 
generation between platform and rig and upgrading existing 
equipment.
￮ At our Sarawak Shell Berhad assets in Malaysia: optimising the 
usage of Gas Turbine Generators from four to three units.
Examples of some of the principal measures that were taken in 2022 
are listed below (with estimated total savings of around 1,155 million 
kWh in 2022):
￮ At our GTL asset in Qatar, we completed several projects to 
reduce energy use and improve efficiency, for example by making 
improvements to catalyst performance which resulted in reduced 
generation of off-gas leading to lower energy consumption.
￮ At our Gulf of Mexico operations in the USA, we implemented a 
project to reduce energy use and improve efficiency by using waste 
heat to generate steam.
￮ At our Upstream operations in the UK, we completed several 
projects to reduce energy use and improve efficiency, for example 
by implementing an online model to optimise fuel gas usage at 
Shearwater (our North Sea oil and gas operated asset).
￮ At our Scotford hydrocarbon processing site in Canada, we 
implemented several projects to reduce energy use and improve 
efficiency, for example by using analysers to optimise fuel usage.
￮ At our Geismar chemical plant in the USA, we implemented several 
projects to reduce energy use and improve efficiency, for example 
by improving how some equipment operates.
￮ At our QGC operations in Australia, we implemented several 
projects to reduce energy use and improve efficiency, for example 
by introducing a CO2/energy performance dashboard for control 
room operators, which allowed operators to identify potential 
efficiency savings based on real-time operating data.
EU Taxonomy Regulation
The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system for determining 
when an economic activity can be considered environmentally 
sustainable according to European Union (EU) standards. It aims to 
encourage investment in a low-carbon economy by creating common 
definitions of sustainability and mandatory disclosures to help investors 
make informed decisions. As a UK company with its registered office 
and headquarters in London, Shell plc is not currently subject to the 
Taxonomy Regulation. Nevertheless, we elect to report against the 
taxonomy voluntarily because we recognise the importance of 
increasing transparency about how companies are progressing in the 
energy transition, even if the regulation is evolving. We expect to come 
into scope in 2024 via the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD), which extends the reporting obligations under the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation to third-country issuers that are listed on 
European exchanges.

Strategic Report | Performance in the year
Respecting nature
114 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 116 ----
Introduction
Respecting nature is part of our Powering Progress strategy. We 
recognise there is a growing global urgency to protect and enhance 
biodiversity, conserve fresh water and use resources more efficiently. As 
a business, we use natural resources such as land, water and materials 
for our operations. Our activities can have an impact on nature through 
discharges and emissions to the environment, and through changes 
to the use of land and water, including oceans. 
In 2003, we decided not to explore for, or develop, oil and gas 
resources in natural and mixed World Heritage Sites. 
Since launching our Powering Progress strategy in 2021, we have:
￮ worked to embed respecting nature into our activities and business 
processes;
￮ enhanced our internal performance management systems to track 
and report on progress; and
￮ continued to build employees' awareness, knowledge and skills 
to deepen their understanding of respecting nature. 
We are also updating our environmental standards and guidance 
used by our projects and facilities around the world.
In 2023, we reviewed our progress and performance on respecting 
nature. We consolidated our respecting nature ambitions announced 
as part of our Powering Progress strategy in 2021 into the following 
themes: having a positive impact on biodiversity, aiming for zero 
waste and using water, other resources and materials efficiently.
We have already achieved some of the respecting nature commitments 
we set when we launched Powering Progress. Our commitment to 
reduce fresh-water consumption in highly water-stressed areas by 
15% was achieved ahead of the target date of 2025. We have also 
conducted detailed assessments to inform our approach to fresh 
water and waste, which will be tailored to local conditions. We are 
working to help develop a viable circular economy for plastics but 
have concluded that the scale of our ambition to use 1 million tonnes 
of plastic waste a year in our global chemical plants by 2025 is 
unfeasible due to lack of available plastic waste feedstock, slow 
technology development and regulatory uncertainty.
The remaining commitments announced in 2021 have either been 
incorporated into our new Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
(SEAM) Standards, which take effect from mid-2024, or are included 
in the relevant business objectives and processes.
See "Living by our values" on page 137 and our 2023 Sustainability Report. 
Governance
Respecting the environment and local communities has been integral to 
the way we do business for many years, as set out in the Shell General 
Business Principles and the Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, 
Security, Safety, the Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP). 
Our Executive Committee is accountable for the delivery of respecting 
nature, progress towards which is reviewed by our Board's 
Sustainability Committee (SUSCO).
See "Sustainability Committee" on pages 160-161 and "Living by our values" on page 135.
Environmental standards
Shell's global environmental standards are set out in our HSSE & SP 
Control Framework and we seek to apply them wherever we operate. 
Our approach draws on external standards and guidelines, such as 
those developed by the World Bank and the International Finance 
Corporation. Our environmental standards include details of how 
to manage emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG); consume energy 
more efficiently; reduce gas flaring, and monitor and improve air 
quality; prevent spills and leaks of hazardous materials; use less 
fresh water; and conserve biodiversity. 
When planning new major projects, we conduct detailed 
environmental, social and health impact assessments. The Shell HSSE & 
SP Standards require that we certify our major installations against an 
internationally recognised independent environmental management 
system standard if they have significant environmental risks. Major 
installations are crude oil and natural gas terminals; gas plants; 
manned offshore and onshore production platforms or flow stations; 
floating production and storage vessels; refineries; chemicals 
manufacturing facilities; mines; or upgraders. For the purpose of this 
Report, we did not count each major installation in Upstream and 
Integrated Gas separately. They were aggregated into their respective 
operating unit or operating company, such as Shell Upstream UK or 
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), in line with the scope 
of their certifications. At the end of 2023, 89% of major installations 
within that scope and operated by Shell were certified against the 
ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System or were in 
compliance with equivalent environmental frameworks required by 
local regulations. We are pursuing certification for the remainder. 
In addition, many installations that are not classified as major, such 
as lubricant plants or supply terminals, are also certified against 
ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System but are not 
included in the data above.
See SP Control Framework on page 137 and "Our journey to net zero" on page 86.
Environmental costs
We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, regulations and 
reporting requirements in the countries where we operate. Infringing 
any of these laws, regulations and requirements could harm our 
reputation and ability to do business, and result in significant costs, 
including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims. 
Ongoing operating expenses include the costs of preventing 
unauthorised discharges into the air and water, and the safe 
disposal and handling of waste.
See Note 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 275-276.
We place a premium on developing effective technologies that are 
also safe for the environment. But when operating at the forefront 
of technology, there is always the possibility that a new technology 
has environmental impacts that were not assessed or foreseen to be 
harmful when originally implemented. We develop new technology 
using a robust technology maturation process. This enables us to 
systematically de-risk technical and commercial risks, while ensuring 
portfolio alignment with Shell's strategic ambitions and deployment 
commitments. While we believe we take reasonable precautions 
to limit these risks, we could be subject to additional remedial, 
environmental and litigation costs as a result of unknown and 
unforeseen impacts of operations on the environment.

Positive impact on biodiversity 
and ecosystems
Our priorities for biodiversity are critical and forest habitats.
￮ Forest habitats: We will replant forests, achieving net-zero 
deforestation from new activities, while maintaining biodiversity 
and conservation value, commenced in 2022.
￮ Critical habitats: Our new projects in areas rich in biodiversity – 
critical habitats – will have a net positive impact on biodiversity, 
commenced in 2021. We apply the same definition for measuring 
our net positive impact (NPI) for projects as the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC, 2019). The IFC states: NPI on biodiversity is a 
target for project outcomes in which the impacts on biodiversity (for 
example, the variety of ecosystems and living things) caused by the 
project are outweighed by the actions taken to avoid and reduce 
such impacts, rehabilitate affected species and / or landscapes 
and offset any residual impacts.
When planning a new project on land or offshore in the marine 
environment, we apply the mitigation hierarchy, a decision-making 
framework that involves a sequence of four key actions: avoid, 
minimise, restore and offset. We assess the potential impact of 
projects on biodiversity and local communities as part of our 
impact assessment process.
In 2023, we embedded our biodiversity commitments into our new 
Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards, which 
take effect in mid-2024. We are developing guidance and sharing 
good practice across the organisation to support implementation.

Forest habitats
Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses. 
We use the definition of forest used by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations.
Our aim is to avoid deforestation, in line with the mitigation hierarchy. 
Where avoidance cannot be achieved, we require our projects and 
assets to develop and implement reforestation plans that include 
measures to achieve net-zero deforestation, while maintaining 
biodiversity and conservation value. We work with partners and 
stakeholders to develop robust and credible plans unique to each 
reforestation project.
Between January 2022 and the end of 2023, around 292 hectares 
had been deforested as a result of our activities. This occurred largely 
in Australia, Canada and Nigeria where reforestation plans have 
been finalised.
Critical habitats
Potential new projects are screened to determine if they are located 
in a critical habitat. If we decide to proceed with a project that is in 
a critical habitat, we develop a biodiversity action plan. This sets out 
actions needed to follow the mitigation hierarchy and, where there 
is impact, the actions designed to achieve a net positive impact.
At the end of 2023, 43 of our new projects, which started after we 
launched Powering Progress in February 2021, were wholly or partly 
located in critical habitats. Of these, 20 already have a biodiversity 
action plan in place to work towards a net positive impact, compared 
with four in 2022.
Resource use and circular economy
As part of our overall respecting nature ambition, we aim to use 
water, other resources and materials efficiently, and to increase reuse 
and recycling. We have conducted detailed assessments across our 
businesses to better understand our waste streams and define our 
approach. Our businesses are developing local waste management 
implementation plans. We are exploring ways to improve the 
application of circular economy principles by developing 
circularity strategies.
Water
We are implementing water stewardship principles across our 
businesses and developing local improvement plans. This includes 
focusing on the sustainable management of fresh water, including 
in water-stressed areas. 
Our Powering Progress strategy launched in 2021 contained the 
following water-related statements:
￮ Our ambition is to conserve fresh water by reducing consumption 
and increasing reuse and recycling.
￮ We will reduce the amount of fresh water consumed in our facilities, 
starting by reducing our consumption of fresh water by 15% by 
2025, compared with 2018 levels, in areas where there is high 
pressure on fresh-water resources.
In 2023, we continued to make progress in reducing our consumption 
of fresh water in highly water-stressed areas.
At the end of 2023, four of our major facilities were located in areas 
where there is a high level of water stress based on analysis using 
water stress tools. These tools include the World Resources Institute's 
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and local assessments. The facilities are: 
￮ Pearl GTL (gas-to-liquids) plant in Qatar; 
￮ Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore; 
￮ Shell Jurong Island chemical plant in Singapore; and 
￮ Tabangao Import Terminal in the Philippines.
In 2023, these facilities consumed 17 million cubic metres of fresh 
water, compared with 18 million cubic metres in 2022. With this 
reduction we achieved our commitment to reduce fresh-water 
consumption by our facilities in areas of high water stress by 15% 
compared with our 2018 levels with a baseline of 25 million cubic 
metres. The reduction was mainly the result of decreased water use 
at the Pearl GTL gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar, and at the Shell Energy 
and Chemicals Park Singapore following the decommissioning of some 
processing units.
In 2023, for all sites, our overall intake of fresh water increased 
to 162 million cubic metres, compared with 148 million cubic metres 
in 2022 (restated from 156 million cubic metres, following a review of 
the performance data). This increase was mainly the result of increased 
production at Shell's Monaca Polymers facility in the USA and 
consequences of a fire incident at our Deer Park Chemicals site, USA.

Respecting nature continued
116 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 118 ----
Around 33% of our fresh-water intake in 2023 was from public 
utilities, such as municipal water supplies. The rest was taken from 
surface water, such as rivers and lakes (around 51%) and groundwater 
(around 16%). Around 94% of our fresh-water intake in 2023 
was used for manufacturing oil products and chemicals, with
the rest mainly used for oil and gas production.
Assessing further water use reduction goals
In addition to our Powering Progress commitment to reduce 
water consumption in water-scarce areas, we also aimed to 
assess options for further reduction goals. In 2021 and 2022, 
we conducted detailed water use assessments at six major 
Shell facilities: 
￮ QGC upstream and QGC midstream, Australia; 
￮ Shell MDS, Malaysia; 
￮ Shell Hazira LNG Terminal, India; 
￮ Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland, Germany; and 
￮ Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk, the Netherlands. 
The results of these assessments, along with discussions with 
stakeholders, have moved us towards a more sustainable and 
holistic stewardship approach. This goes beyond focusing on 
water use and includes aspects of governance and water 
quality, involvement of stakeholders and consideration of 
catchments. We are now implementing water stewardship 
principles across our businesses and developing local 
improvement plans. By the end of 2023, we had completed 
detailed assessments against these principles at eight of our 
downstream and upstream facilities to identify opportunities 
for improvement. We plan to roll out this programme across 
other facilities and projects in 2024.

Waste water and produced water
We track low-level concentrations of oil, grease and other 
hydrocarbons in water returned to the environment from the day-to-day 
running of our facilities (referred to as "discharges to surface water"). 
We work to minimise these discharges according to local regulatory 
requirements and our own standards.
In 2023, the combined total of hydrocarbons discharged (oil in 
effluents) to surface water across all our facilities increased to 
1.0 thousand tonnes compared with 0.9 thousand tonnes in 2022. 
The increase was partially due to discharges from the Shell Energy 
and Chemicals Park Singapore.
In 2023, we disposed of 58 million cubic metres of produced water, 
unchanged compared with 2022.
Waste
In 2023, we started to embed the findings from the 24 waste and 
circularity assessments we conducted in 2021 and 2022 into local 
performance management systems. Our businesses are developing 
local waste management implementation plans. We are investigating 
options to reduce some of the more significant of our waste streams, 
such as biosludge, potentially contaminated soils and drilling fluids.
We are exploring ways to improve the application of circular economy 
principles and to identify and integrate the risks and opportunities 
associated with a "rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, repair, recycle" 
hierarchy. We also work with our supply chain to help our businesses 
progress towards our aim of zero waste.

Mitigation hierarchy
In 2023, we disposed of 631 thousand tonnes of hazardous waste, 
compared with 878 thousand tonnes in 2022 (restated from 868 
thousand tonnes, following a review of the performance data). The 
decrease was partially because of lower volumes of sour water for 
disposal from processing activities at the Shell Scotford Refinery in 
Canada. In 2023, we disposed of 1,619 thousand tonnes of non-
hazardous waste, compared with 1,135 thousand tonnes in 2022. 
The increase was primarily caused by higher volumes of water from 
production and maintenance activities that required disposal at the 
Shell-operated Scotford Upgrader (Shell interest 10%), Canada, 
and the ramp up of low-carbon solutions and other project work. 
In total, we disposed of 2,251 thousand tonnes of waste, compared 
with 2,012 thousand tonnes in 2022 (restated from 1,982 thousand 
tonnes, following a review of the performance data). We also sent 
654 thousand tonnes of residual materials for reuse, recycling or use 
as a raw material in another process. For example, waste that might 
otherwise go to landfill can be incinerated to generate energy.
Air quality
Air quality continues to be embedded in our environmental standards. 
We follow our own standards and those of local regulators to manage 
airborne pollutants in our oil and gas production and processing, 
including emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and volatile 
organic compounds.
￮ Our sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions in 2023 decreased to 31 
thousand tonnes, compared with 37 thousand tonnes in 2022 
(restated from 36 thousand tonnes, following a review of the 
performance data). The decrease was mainly because of less 
flaring at the Shell-operated Scotford Upgrader in Canada and 
the divestment of Shell-operated Upstream assets in Tunisia.
￮ Our nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in 2023 decreased to 88 
thousand tonnes from 93 thousand tonnes in 2022. The decrease 
was partially because of divestments of Shell-operated Upstream 
assets in Tunisia and the Philippines, and downtime of generators 
at Shell-operated assets in Trinidad and Tobago.
￮ Our emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 2023 
decreased to 36 thousand tonnes from 37 thousand tonnes in 2022 
(restated from 38 thousand tonnes, following a review of the 
performance data). The decrease was partially because of planned 
and unplanned downtime of operations at Shell MDS, our GTL (gas-
to-liquids) plant in Bintulu, Malaysia.

Spills
Large spills of crude oil, oil products and chemicals associated with 
our operations can harm the environment, and result in major clean-up 
costs, fines and other damages. They can also affect our licence to 
operate and harm our reputation. 
Working to prevent spills
We have requirements and procedures designed to prevent 
spills. We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the 
intention of avoiding spills. To minimise the risk of spills, Shell 
has routine programmes to reduce failures and maintain the 
reliability of facilities and pipelines.
Our business units are responsible for organising and executing 
spill responses in line with Shell guidelines and relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements. Our offshore installations have spill 
response plans for when an incident occurs. These plans set out 
response strategies and techniques, available equipment, and 
trained personnel and contracts. We can engage specialist 
contracted services for oil spill response, including vessels, 
aircraft or other equipment and resources, if required, for large 
spills. We conduct regular exercises that seek to ensure these 
plans remain effective and fit for purpose.
We have further developed our ability to respond to spills to 
surface water. We have a worldwide network of trained staff 
to help with this. We also have a global oil spill expertise centre 
which tests local capability and maintains our ability to respond 
to a significant spill into a marine environment.

at offshore Malaysia. 
Spills still occur for reasons such as operational failure, accidents, 
unusual corrosion or sabotage and theft. In 2023, there were 70 
operational spills of more than 100 kilograms each compared with 
55 in 2022 (restated from 54 operational spills, following a review 
of the performance data). The weight of operational spills of oil and 
oil products in 2023 was 0.37 thousand tonnes, compared with 
0.06 thousand tonnes in 2022. In 2023, 140 spills were caused by 
sabotage. Of those, 139 were in Nigeria and one in Australia. The 
number of these spills increased to 140 in 2023 from 75 in 2022, with 
the volume also increasing to 1.4 thousand tonnes from 0.6 thousand 
tonnes in 2022.
See "Safety" section on page 132 for more information on emergency response.
Spills in Nigeria
In the Niger Delta, over the last 13 years, the total number of 
operational hydrocarbon spills and the volume of oil spilled from
them into the environment have been significantly reduced.
Most oil spills in the Niger Delta region continue to be caused by crude 
oil theft, the sabotage of oil and gas production facilities, and illegal 
oil refining, including the distribution of illegally refined products.
In 2023, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited 
(SPDC) [A], as operator of the SPDC joint venture (Shell interest 30%), 
reported nine operational spill incidents of more than 100 kilograms of 
crude oil, compared with 10 reported in 2022. The volume of around 
0.005 thousand tonnes was less than the 0.01 thousand tonnes 
reported in 2022.
[A] Unless otherwise stated, all activities reported for or as relating to The Shell Petroleum 
Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in this section should be understood as 
SPDC acting as the operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV). SPDC, as the corporate
entity, owns 30% of the JV.
SPDC has an ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain 
and replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines to reduce 
the number of operational spills. In 2023, around 54 kilometres
of pipelines and flow lines were replaced. This work is organised 
through a proactive pipeline and flow line integrity management 
system. The system installs barriers where necessary, and 
recommends when and where pipeline sections should 
be replaced to prevent failures.
In January 2024, Shell announced the sale of its Nigerian onshore 
subsidiary, SPDC. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory 
approvals and other conditions. 
See the "Upstream" section on page 46.
Spills caused by sabotage in 2023
In 2023, about 94% of the oil spills of more than 100 kilograms each 
from the SPDC-operated facilities were caused by the illegal activities 
of third parties. In 2023, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 
100 kilograms caused by sabotage was around 1.4 thousand 
tonnes (139 incidents), compared with around 0.6 thousand tonnes 
(75 incidents) in 2022. The increased number of incidents in 2023 can 
be directly attributed to an increase in third-party illegal connections 
on pipelines, with 119 incidents reported in 2023 compared with 56 in 
2022. SPDC continues to work with the government security agencies 
to maintain surveillance and address illegal activities of third parties, 
primarily along the SPDC JV pipeline and its operational areas.
Prevention
In 2023, SPDC continued on-ground surveillance of its areas of 
operation, including its pipeline network, to mitigate third-party 
interference and ensure that spills are detected and responded
to as quickly as possible.
There are daily surveillance flights covering the most vulnerable 
segments of the pipeline network to identify any new spills or illegal 
activity. SPDC has introduced anti-theft protection mechanisms for 
key infrastructure such as wellheads and manifolds. The programme 
to protect wellheads with steel cages continues to help deter theft, 
and drones have been introduced to inspect pipelines and monitor 
security of operations.
In 2023, 60 steel cages were installed, bringing the total number 
to 374. This includes 52 cages that have been upgraded with CCTV 
and 28 with satellite communications. In 2023, out of 508 registered 
attempts to compromise these cages, 38 were successful.

Response and remediation
Regardless of the cause of a spill, SPDC cleans up and remediates 
areas affected by spills originating from its facilities. In 2023, the time 
that SPDC needed to complete the recovery of free-phase oil – oil that 
forms a separate layer and is not mixed with water or soil – remained 
at around one week. This is the average time it takes to safely access
a damaged site, initiate containment to prevent further spread of the 
spill, and start joint investigation visits with regulators, affected 
communities and, in some cases, with NGOs.
Clean-up activities include bio-remediation which stimulates micro-
organisms that naturally break down and use carbon-rich oil as a 
source of food and energy, effectively removing it. Once clean-up 
and remediation operations are completed, the work is inspected 
and, if satisfactory, approved and certified by the Nigerian regulators. 
With operational spills, SPDC also pays compensation to affected 
people and communities.
SPDC has been working with the International Union for Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN) since 2012 to enhance remediation techniques and 
protect biodiversity at sites affected by oil spills in its areas of operation 
in the Niger Delta. Based on this collaboration, SPDC has launched 
further initiatives to help strengthen its remediation and restoration 
efforts. In 2021, SPDC, IUCN, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, 
and Wetlands International began working together as the Niger 
Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group (BTAG), which continues 
to monitor biodiversity recovery at remediated sites.
SPDC also works with a range of stakeholders in the Niger Delta
to build greater trust in spill response and clean-up processes. For 
example, local communities participate in remediation work for 
operational spills. Various NGOs have sometimes gone on joint 
investigation visits with SPDC, government regulators and members
of affected communities to establish the cause and volume of oil spills. 
SPDC has continued to raise awareness of and counter the negative 
effects of crude oil theft and illegal oil refining, both causing oil spills. 
Examples include awareness and education programmes, community-
based pipeline surveillance and promoting alternative livelihoods 
through Shell's flagship youth entrepreneurship programme, 
Shell LiveWIRE.
Ogoniland: Commitment to the United Nations 
Environment Programme
SPDC remains committed to the implementation of the 2011 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report on 
Ogoniland which assessed contamination from oil operations 
in the region and recommended actions to clean it up. Over the 
last 12 years, SPDC has acted on all and completed most of the 
UNEP recommendations that were specifically addressed to it 
as the operator of the joint venture. 
The clean-up efforts are led by the Hydrocarbon Pollution and 
Remediation Project (HYPREP), which was established by the 
Nigerian government. The UNEP report had recorded 67 sites, 
of which two were classified as waste sites without hydrocarbon 
pollution. Also, for 13 sites, the National Oil Spill Detection and 
Response Agency (NOSDRA) certified that - in contrast to the 
original report - remediation was not needed. 
This left 52 sites to be remediated, with all completed sites to 
be certified by NOSDRA. In 2021 and 2022, remediation was 
completed for 18 sites, and certification issued for 13 of those. 
In 2023, remediation of one site and certification of three sites 
was completed, and work on the remaining sites continues. 
Field work commenced on 17 sites and remediation plans 
are being developed for the remaining 15 sites.
The UNEP report recommended creating an Ogoni Trust Fund 
(OTF) with $1 billion capital, to be co-funded by the Nigerian 
government, SPDC JV, SPDC (30% interest in SPDC JV) and 
other operators in the area. The SPDC JV is responsible for 
contributing $900 million to the OTF, the Nigerian government 
and other operators for contributing $100 million. By the 
end of 2023, SPDC had fully paid its share of the SPDC JV's 
commitments to the clean-up process which brought the 
total contribution to the OTF to $751 million. 
Although remediation works continue to make progress, 
challenges remain. These include re-pollution, land disputes, 
environmental issues such as flooding caused by excessive 
rainfall, and security issues in Ogoniland.
UNEP continues to monitor the progress of the clean-up through 
its observer status at HYPREP´s Governing Council and the 
Ogoni Trust Fund. UN agencies, such as the United Nations 
Development Programme and the United Nations Institute for 
Training and Research, provide services to HYPREP in the areas 
of livelihood programmes, training and project services.

Bodo clean-up 
process
In 2015, SPDC and the Bodo community in Ogoniland signed 
a memorandum of understanding (MOU), granting SPDC access 
to begin cleaning up areas affected by two operational spills that 
occurred in 2008. The MOU also provided for the selection of 
two international contractors to conduct the clean-up under the 
oversight of an independent project director. Engagement with the 
Bodo community and other stakeholders began in 2015, and was 
managed by the Bodo Mediation Initiative. The clean-up project 
was delayed in 2016 and for most of 2017 because access to 
the sites was challenged by the local community. 
In September 2017, a three-phase clean-up and remediation 
programme started: 
￮ Phase 1: Removal of oil from shoreline surfaces and mud 
flat beds was completed in 2018.
￮ Phase 2: Remediation activities related to soil and sediments 
started in late 2019 on the around 1,000 hectares designated 
for clean-up. By the end of 2023, work on around 88% of that 
area had been completed. In late 2022, the work had to be 
suspended because of safety concerns and community unrest. 
Work resumed at the end of 2023, following a dispute 
resolution process and continues into 2024. 
￮ Phase 3: The replanting of mangrove seedlings started in 2021. 
Around two million seedlings need to be planted and survive to 
2025 to fulfil the project's goal. By the end of 2023, the number 
of seedlings planted remained at 340,000, the level reached 
at the end of 2022, because of community unrest.

Introduction
Shell is dedicated to making a positive impact on people around the 
world — by providing the vital energy people need, championing 
inclusion, respecting human rights and contributing to local 
communities and economies.
Around 760 million people [A] in the world have no electricity and 
over half the world population has insufficient energy to lead a good 
life [B]. We deliver energy commercially, by investing in businesses that 
supply energy access in emerging markets; and socially, by investing 
funds, expertise and resources in access to energy programmes.
[A] International Energy Agency, SDG7: Data and Projections, 2023.
[B] UN Human Development Index. Approximately 75 GJ final energy per capita is the 
threshold where populations reach 0.8 on UN Human Development Index which can 
be considered a good life.
We also want to help communities benefit from having us as their 
neighbour. We generate jobs, pay billions in tax each year and 
support start-ups, local businesses and education programmes. And we 
promote human rights in the communities, companies and organisations 
we work with. This includes activities such as advancing worker welfare 
and shaping an inclusive world so that everyone can be themselves.
We aim to become one of the world's most diverse and inclusive 
organisations, a place where everyone feels valued and respected. 
Our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people underpin 
our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion. Shell is committed to 
respecting human rights as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
The importance of respecting people also extends to our suppliers. 
Shell's Supplier Principles outline our expectations for business integrity, 
including safety, security, labour and human rights, and environmental 
and social performance. We expect all suppliers to understand and 
implement the principles in their supply chains when working with Shell.
Governance
Respecting people has been integral to the way we do business for 
many years. Shell's HSSE & SP Control Framework sets out how we 
identify, assess and manage our impacts on communities where we 
operate, including any impact on human rights. The Framework also 
defines how we should share the benefits arising from our presence, 
such as by providing local employment and contractual opportunities.
We are transitioning from the HSSE & SP Control Framework to our 
new Safety, Environment and Asset Management Standards (SEAM) 
as part of the Shell Performance Framework. The SEAM Standards 
will come into effect from mid-2024.
See "Living by our values" on page 137.
As part of our aim to become one of the most diverse and inclusive 
organisations in the world, our CEO and Executive Committee are 
accountable for our progress against our diversity, equity and 
inclusion goals.

Contribution to society
Shell's businesses are part of society and contribute to it by buying and 
selling goods and services in many countries. Our employees, suppliers 
and contractors are part of the local communities where we operate. 
Our activities generate revenues for governments through the taxes 
and royalties we pay and the taxes we collect on their behalf. This 
helps governments fund health care, education, transport and other 
essential services.
Payments to governments
In 2023, Shell paid and collected $67 billion in taxes* to 
governments. We paid $14 billion in corporate income taxes and 
$6 billion in government royalties, and collected $47 billion in excise 
duties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and other products 
on behalf of governments.
Supply chain engagement
We continue to explore how we can source responsibly in our supply 
chain. In 2023, our operated and non-operated ventures spent around 
$48.6 billion on goods and services from suppliers around the world*.
Shell aims to work with suppliers, including individual contractors, that 
behave in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible 
manner, as set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell 
Supplier Principles. In 2023, we worked with around 25,000 
suppliers globally.
Our standard contract terms require adherence to these or equivalent 
principles, and require contractors and suppliers to:
￮ protect the environment in compliance with all applicable 
environmental laws and regulations;
￮ use energy and natural resources efficiently; and
￮ continually look for ways to minimise waste, emissions and 
discharge from their operations, products and services.
Helping our suppliers decarbonise
We continually work with our suppliers to find ways to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chains. We seek 
to understand their energy needs and jointly identify potential
low-carbon solutions that are economically sustainable. This 
involves using digital technology to establish transparency in 
energy consumption and emissions throughout our supply chain.
See our website shell.com for more information about how we engage with 
contractors and suppliers.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
Social investment
Our activities contribute to economies through taxes, jobs and business 
opportunities. We also make social investments in areas determined by 
local community needs and priorities. These investments are sometimes 
voluntary, sometimes required by governments, or part of a 
contractual agreement. Through voluntary initiatives, we work with 
partner organisations to help individuals and communities access 
reliable electricity. In 2023, we continued to develop programmes to 
improve access to energy in Nigeria, Pakistan, India and South Africa.
In 2023, we spent almost $198 million on social investment, of 
which 35% was required by government regulations or contractual 
agreements. We spent the remaining $128.3 million (65%) on 
voluntary social programmes.
2023 Social investment spend by theme
[A] CSED – Community Skills & Enterprise Development.
Around $84.8 million of our total social investment spend in 2023 
was in countries that, according to the UN Development Programme's 
Human Development Index 2021, have a gross national income 
of less than $15,000 a year per person.

Engaging with communities
We engage with communities as part of our approach to managing 
human rights and providing access to remedy. Shell's HSSE & SP 
Control Framework helps us to operate responsibly and avoid or 
minimise potentially negative social impacts of our operations. When 
we divest assets or exit areas, we apply well-established processes to 
guide our risk assessment with the aim of leaving a positive legacy.
The requirements are supplemented by guidance that helps 
practitioners on the ground to engage with communities around our 
operations. Major projects and facilities operated by Shell have a 
social performance plan for managing potentially negative impacts, 
such as noise pollution, and maximising benefits, such as using 
local suppliers. These plans typically begin with defining the social 
environment, focusing in particular on people who may be especially 
vulnerable to the potential impacts of our operations. In the larger 
of these major projects and facilities, we implement a community 
feedback mechanism for listening and responding to questions 
and resolving complaints in a timely manner. 
We have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or mitigate potential 
impacts on the traditional lifestyles and cultural heritage of Indigenous 
Peoples. We also have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or 
mitigate their involuntary resettlement.
Since 2020, we have used our online community feedback tool 
to track and respond to questions, complaints and feedback that 
we receive. It allows our network of 148 community engagement 
practitioners to document feedback and outcomes. They are the 
face of Shell in the communities and act as a bridge between 
communities and our activities.
In 2023, we increased the number of sites with a community feedback 
mechanism aligned with the effectiveness criteria of the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights from 16 to 20. Several more 
sites have other procedures in place for gathering feedback. In 2023, 
we received feedback at 80 sites in 26 countries.
See our website shell.com for more information about our work with communities.
Human rights
Human rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, 
integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded 
in the Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. Our 
approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. We work closely with various organisations to improve 
how we apply these UN guiding principles.
Salient human rights
In 2023, we continued to work on salient human rights issues (salient 
human rights are those that are most at risk from our operations). 
We prioritise four focus areas where respect for human rights is 
critical to how we operate: the workplace including labour rights, 
supply chain, communities and security.
Shell employees working in these focus areas need to complete 
mandatory human rights training. About 1,750 employees had 
completed the training between its launch in 2021 and the end 
of 2023, 94% of those assigned the training. We encourage 
all employees to complete the course, regardless of their role, 
to build greater understanding of human rights across Shell.
See the table below for examples of our salient human rights 
issues in each focus area.
Human rights focus areas
For each of these areas, we have systems to identify potential impacts 
and to avoid and mitigate them. 
For example, Shell's HSSE & SP Control Framework contains 
requirements that set out how we identify, assess and manage our 
impacts on communities where we operate, including any impact 
on human rights.
Our Shell Supplier Principles state that we expect our contractors 
and suppliers to respect the human rights of their workforce and 
to manage the social impacts of their activities on Shell's 
neighbouring communities.
We also continue to track emerging human rights and environmental 
due diligence legislation, and advance our efforts to strengthen human-
rights-related controls in our supply chain.
Critical habitats and people 
We assess the potential impacts of our activities to manage and 
reduce any adverse effects they may have on the environment and 
on communities. We apply stringent standards across all our projects 
and facilities, particularly when we operate in critical habitats that 
are rich in biodiversity and in areas of cultural significance or close 
to local communities, including Indigenous Peoples.
See our website shell.com for more information about our approach to human rights.

Our people 
Our people are essential to the development of energy solutions 
for today and tomorrow. They are key to delivering Shell's Powering 
Progress strategy and we believe in helping them to develop their 
skills. We aim to become one of the world's most diverse and inclusive 
organisations, a place where everyone feels valued and respected. 
All metrics throughout this section exclude the employees in portfolio 
companies, except for the metrics reflecting total employee number 
by gender and region, percentage of women employees, and 
certain mandatory training courses.
Employee overview
We employed 103,000 people on a full- or part-time basis at the end of 
2023. This compares with 93,000 at the end of 2022 and 83,000 at the 
end of 2021. The data include people working in Shell subsidiaries, Shell-
operated joint ventures and those seconded to non-Shell-operated joint 
operations, or ventures and associates. The employee numbers for 2021 
reflect headcount in the Shell HR system and full-time equivalent numbers 
for portfolio companies, which maintain their own HR systems. 
Additionally, Shell businesses utilise contractors on certain projects during 
the year. For example, in 2023 contractors worked alongside Shell 
employees in divisions such as Information and Digital Technology
In 2023
Changes in headcount
In Shell companies, excluding portfolio companies, headcount rose 
to 84,000 at the end of 2023 from 79,000 at the end of 2022 due 
to growth in Information and Digital Technology, and Downstream, 
Renewables and Energy Solutions. 
As we continue to implement our Powering Progress strategy, in Shell's 
portfolio companies which maintain their own HR systems, headcount 
rose to 19,000 at the end of 2023 from 14,000 at the end of 2022. 
This was partly driven by acquisitions and growth in Downstream, 
Renewables and Energy Solutions. 
 
See Note 32 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 289 for the average 
number of employees by business segment.

Shell aims to be an attractive employer to its existing and prospective 
employees. We offer employees the opportunity to develop their 
careers within Shell, including rotations across different parts of 
the business to grow their skills and progress. 
In 2023, 11.2% of Shell employees were promoted compared with 
14.3% in 2022. 
Shell's turnover in 2023 was 5.7%; 4,685 employees left Shell of which 
2,669 resigned voluntarily. This compares with 8.5% in 2022, during 
which 6,630 employees left Shell of which 3,942 voluntarily.
Employee engagement 
Insight into employee needs and perspectives enables Shell to 
continually learn and improve our policies, processes, and practices. 
Management regularly engages with employees through elected 
employee representatives and a range of local formal and informal 
channels. These channels include webcasts and all-employee messages 
from our CEO and other senior leaders, as well as town halls, team 
meetings and site visits by the Board and EC. 
In 2023, members of the Board and EC visited certain Shell sites in 
Canada where they engaged with employees on our strategy and the 
energy transition. Shell plc's Chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, also met with 
Shell employees on his site visits to the Netherlands, China and Germany.
 
See "Board activities" on page 148.
We seek to comply with applicable local laws and regulations, 
including on working hours. We aim to eliminate discrimination in 
employment, forced labour and child labour. We respect the right to 
collective bargaining and freedom of association. Where appropriate, 
engagements take place with union representatives at asset and 
country level, as well as with the Shell European Works Council.
Employees have access to senior leaders, local employee forums 
and employee resource groups. These engagements enable Shell to 
maintain a constructive employee and industrial relations environment. 
Team leadership plays a key role in driving employee engagement. 
We seek to develop leaders through learning programmes, domestic 
and international assignments, and project opportunities. In 2023, 22% 
of team leaders in Shell received access to Shell's leadership learning 
programme, LEAD. Our mindset and behaviours, which emphasise 
psychological safety, are at the heart of our leadership programmes. 
We aspire to equip our employees with skills and experience through 
the digital and energy transition. People development is a priority at 
Shell. Learning and development is part of our organisational culture 
and budget planning. Training courses are accessible to all employees, 
either online or in person. In 2023, 295,000 formal training days were 
delivered to employees and joint-venture partners. This compares with 
266,000 training days in 2022. 
We aim to equip our employees with the skills they will need for 
digitalisation and the energy transition, and we have increased the 
learning offerings available for new skills. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell 
employees completed courses on topics such as hydrogen production, 
carbon capture and storage, and energy management. This is an 
increase from 4,000 in 2022. Where appropriate, we recruit talent 
externally to add to the skills and experiences of our workforce. 
The Shell People Survey
The Shell People Survey is one of the key tools we use to 
measure employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and 
commitment to Shell. We believe that increased employee 
engagement can result in better business performance and 
improve safety. In 2023, the response rate to the survey was 
88% (from 87% in 2022). The average employee engagement 
score remain unchanged at 79% from the 2022 level, which is 
top quartile in comparison with external benchmarks. This score 
suggests that, overall, our people are engaged, enjoy their work 
and are loyal to Shell. This number excludes scores from our 
joint-venture partners who participated voluntarily in the Shell 
People Survey.
Employee well-being 
Shell provides competitive remuneration with a range of benefits, 
such as global minimum maternity leave of 16 weeks and at least 
eight weeks' paid parental leave for non-birthing parents.
Financial well-being
Shell's remuneration is designed to be market competitive and free 
from bias. We aim to ensure equal pay for equal work. Through 
regular benchmarking, Shell's compensation is typically higher than 
the minimum wage level observed locally, including in countries without 
legislation on minimum wage. Pay adjustment at Shell is directly linked 
to performance management. The system is shared transparently with 
all employees to help them understand how their pay adjustments are 
made annually. We continue to engage employees transparently and 
openly about our pay policies to help build understanding, trust, and 
confidence in our approach.
Flexible work 
We seek to build a sense of community and collaboration within 
Shell's sites where we want employees to feel welcome and valued. 
By enabling people to balance their work and personal lives, we can 
help them perform at their best. Our Future of Work guide advises 
employees and team leaders on hybrid working options. Shell offers 
to meet both business and personal needs. 
Physical, social, and mental well-being 
Our goal is to empower our employees to feel their best and perform 
at their best. We do this by promoting mindsets and behaviours 
that support good health, by protecting our people from illness by 
mitigating known risk factors. We do this by using evidence-based 
tools, and by providing access to timely support and care for those 
who are injured, ill or struggling.

Powering lives continued
127 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 129 ----
Interventions to promote mental, physical, and social well-being are 
delivered via a mix of measures. For example, through the design of our 
workspaces, through benefits offerings such as gyms and health checks, 
and through our country-based employee networks, group activities 
and events. Our global campaigns, such as Care for Self and I'm Not 
OK, develop individual and team well-being skill sets, to create healthy 
and psychologically safe working environments, and to nurture a 
culture of care. 
Mental well-being 
At Shell we strive to reduce the stigma related to mental ill health 
through open conversations, global and country-level campaigns, 
senior leader communications, engagements with elected employee 
representatives and through our experience-sharing portal for 
employees. This commitment is underscored by the CEO's signing 
of the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental 
Health Pledge in January 2023.
Global Mental Well-being Programme
In November 2023, Shell launched its Global Mental Well-
being Programme following a successful pilot in 2022. The 
programme's interventions have a strong focus on developing 
a workplace culture that supports good mental health, and the 
voluntary survey enables employees to voice their experience 
of well-being in Shell. The data are anonymous and provide KPIs 
to report on progress and to identify opportunities to continually 
improve employee well-being.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
We have set clear goals for diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and 
monitor these on a regular basis. Our CEO and EC are accountable for 
progress. We also continually assess our culture and staff engagement 
through tools such as the annual Shell People Survey. Detailed 
information on progress against our DE&I aspirations can be found 
on shell.com/DEI. 
Shell employees and contractors are required to complete two 
mandatory training courses on DE&I: Conscious Inclusion and Respect 
in the Workplace. These reinforce expected behaviours for a respectful, 
inclusive workplace, and build our stance against discrimination and 
harassment, including bullying and sexual harassment. Employees and 
contractors are required to take these two courses every two years.
In 2023, our Shell People Survey showed a result of 83 points out of 
100 for all questions relating to DE&I. This was unchanged from 2022 
and suggests that overall our people feel that Shell is a workplace in 
which they belong and have equal opportunities to progress and grow. 
The result indicates that our people believe they are provided with a 
safe and inclusive work environment. We will continue to focus on 
improving our DE&I efforts as we strive to improve our result furthe
As of December 31, 2023, 89% of Shell employees now have the 
option to voluntarily declare their gender identity, sexual orientation, 
race and ethnicity, and disability where relevant and legal, via Shell's 
HR system. Data from this self-identification initiative (self-ID) allow us 
to monitor progress against our DE&I aspirations.
Gender
We strive for gender equality and we have signed the World Economic 
Forum declaration on closing the gender gap in the oil and gas sector. 
We have also endorsed the Catalyst CEO Champions for Change 
initiative for the advancement of women, especially those from ethnic 
minorities, into senior leadership and board positions.
In line with the UK Listing Rules, the Board of Shell plc aims for gender 
balance on the Board, with at least one senior board position [A] held 
by a woman. To provide flexibility for periods of change, we aim to 
maintain the representation of both men and of women at, or above, 
a minimum of 40%. As of December 31, 2023, women made up 42% 
of the Board with one senior board position, the CFO role, held by 
a woman. 
[A] Senior board position means Chair, CEO, Senior Independent Director, or CFO.
Over the years, Shell has progressively improved the representation 
of women on the Executive Committee and in senior leadership roles. 
The table below shows the representation of women at December 31, 
2023. As of January 1, 2024, we have more women than men on our 
Executive Committee, at 57%.
Level 2023 2022
Women on Board  42 %  55 %
Women on Executive Committee  43 %  22 %
Women in Senior Leadership roles [A]  32 %  30 %
[A] Senior Leadership is a Shell measure based on compensation grade levels. Shell is working 
towards achieving 35% representation of women in our senior leadership positions by 
2025, and 40% by 2030. This measure is distinct from "senior manager" as per statutory 
disclosure requirements set out in the table below.

[A] Senior manager is defined in section 414C(9) of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
accordingly, the number disclosed comprises the Executive Committee members 
who were not Directors of the Company, and other directors of Shell subsidiaries.
Shell seeks to increase the overall representation of women in the 
organisation. As of December 31, 2023, 35% of Shell employees were 
women. Of the experienced hires who joined Shell in 2023, 38% were 
women compared with 40% in 2022. Of the graduate hires who joined 
Shell in 2023, 40% were women compared with 49% in 2022
A crucial element of improving gender balance is addressing any 
gender pay gap and we continue to work towards improvements in this 
area. We conduct an annual global gender pay equity review using a 
robust statistical approach. In 2023, countries in this review included 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Malaysia, 
the Netherlands, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Singapore, 
South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and the UK.
For example, in the UK, we continue to make progress to close the gap. 
In 2023, the mean gender pay gap of all men and women across all
in-scope [A] Shell companies in the UK is -3.7% to 18.7%, compared 
with 11.7% to 20.7% in 2022.

---- Page 130 ----
In parallel, the mean gender bonus gap ranged from -11.3% to 57% 
in 2023. This gap exists for several reasons, including fewer women in 
senior leadership positions and fewer women in higher-paid specialist 
roles. More information about the UK gender pay gap at Shell can 
be found on our website. 
Race and ethnicity
We are working to address racial inequity and create an inclusive 
work environment where everyone feels valued. In 2020, we 
created the Shell Global Council for Race supported by a 20-member 
Employee Advisory Board composed of members from a diverse mix 
of racial and ethnic backgrounds. The council, which is sponsored by 
the CEO, aims to advance diversity in our workforce so that it better 
reflects communities where we work and from which we draw talent. 
The council focuses on the USA, the UK and the Netherlands.
Shell aims to maintain or exceed having at least one Board member 
from an ethnic minority background, acknowledging that in periods of 
Board change this balance may not be achieved. As of December 31, 
2023, the Board had three members from an ethnic minority group. In 
addition, one of Shell's EC members identifies as being from an ethnic 
minority group. In support of the 2023 Parker Review 
recommendations, Shell aims to achieve 15% ethnic minority group 
representation in its Senior Management by 2027 [A].
[A] As per the 2023 Parker Review, "Senior Management" refers to EC and senior managers 
who report directly to them and "ethnic minority" refers to an individual who self-identifies 
as Asian, Black, Mixed/multiple, or other ethnic minority group, in line with the UK ONS 
classifications.
Due to local restrictions with ethnicity data collection and reporting, 
Shell offers employees the option to voluntarily declare their ethnicity 
via the Self-Identification (Self-ID) initiative [A].
[A] Ethnicity declaration is voluntary and collection of relevant data that is aligned to the UK 
ONS classifications is not available in all countries.
Improving the employee declaration rate via Self-ID continues to be 
a priority as it contributes to building and developing a diverse talent 
pipeline at Shell. 
 
See "Nomination and Succession Committee" on pages 155-159 for our current talent 
management and succession process. 
Shell has reported on its race and ethnicity ambitions in the USA, 
the UK and the Netherlands. The graphic below shows the ethnic 
distribution of Shell employees in the USA as reported to the 
US Department of Labor.
 Employee ethnic diversity – USA
 Employee ethnic diversity – UK
The graphic chart above shows the ethnic diversity of Shell employees 
in the UK based on self-identification data provided by employees. 
As ethnicity declaration is voluntary, our ethnicity declaration rate is 
not 100% and all calculations are based on a declaration rate of 83.1% 
in the UK. The 16.9% of our workforce who have not provided data 
or have chosen not to declare their ethnicity were not included in 
our calculations 
In addition, Shell in the UK voluntarily publishes its ethnicity pay gap 
data and the steps it is taking to close the gap annually. This includes 
a recruitment ambition of 8% Black representation in graduate and 
experienced hires by 2025, in line with UK society.
 
See the Shell UK Diversity Pay Gap Report 2023 on shell.co.uk.
In the Netherlands, we are implementing our Ethnic Inclusion Plan 
which includes initiatives to raise awareness and to promote voluntary 
disclosure of Self-ID data. In 2023, we also recruited 34 new hires 
via Shell's Learning Programme for refugee talent in the Netherlands.
Shell also works with key suppliers to ensure they understand our 
DE&I expectations. 
 
See our website shell.com for more information on our DE&I progress in the UK, the 
USA and the Netherlands.
LGBT+
We are working to advance lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
plus (LGBT+) inclusion within Shell and the communities where we 
work. We promote equal opportunity and aim to create an 
environment where people feel included, regardless of sexual 
orientation or gender identity. Our approach reinforces respect for 
people and provides psychological safety for our LGBT+ employees. 
Most of our work around LGBT+ inclusion happens at a country level 
in line with local policies, laws and regulations. Our Global LGBT+ 
Inclusion Guidelines, published in 2022, are designed to help country 
teams develop their own plans. Of the 15 countries with an LGBT+ 
employee resource group, 13 are adopting these guidelines in their 
multi-year plans.

Benchmarking our LGBT+ initiatives
We benchmark our initiatives externally. In 2023, Shell was 
recognised as an "Advocate" in the 2023 Workplace Pride 
Global benchmark, which is the highest level awarded to 
companies that stand out as clear leaders in LGBTIQ+ workplace 
inclusion. In the USA, we have received a 100% score from the 
Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality 2023 
Index and have achieved a top score every year since 2016.
Disability inclusion and accessibility 
We aim to create an inclusive, psychologically safe and accessible 
environment where people with disabilities can excel. We provide 
support and adjustments for people with disabilities during the 
recruitment process and throughout their careers with Shell, including 
access to educational resources, training programmes, and personal 
and professional development. In May 2023, we launched a Disability, 
Accessibility and Inclusion Portal providing comprehensive guidance 
and tools for line managers, leaders, people with disabilities and 
employees to be active allies. Shell's enABLE employee resource 
groups provide expertise and advice to Shell leaders and our 
businesses on accessibility and disability inclusion. We also offer 
a workplace accessibility service which covers 79 locations in 
37 countries. The team is supported by functions such as Shell 
Health, Human Resources, Real Estate and IT.
Shell is part of the Valuable500, which connects 500 of the world's 
most influential global businesses to help progress large-scale disability 
inclusion. We are also an active members of the Business Disability 
Forum and Purple Space.
Employee share plans
We have several share plans designed to align employees' interests 
with our performance through share ownership.
 
See the "Directors' Remuneration Report", pages 174-176 for information about the share-
based compensation plans for Executive Directors.
Performance Share Plan, Long-term Incentive Plan 
and exchanged awards under the BG Long-term 
Incentive Plan 
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
are designed to ensure that remuneration is clearly aligned with Shell's 
operating plan and longer-term strategic ambitions. The same measures 
apply to Executive Directors and Senior Management and to a 
significantly broader employee base. 
PSPs are long-term incentives, measured over a three-year performance 
period, designed to retain key employees and ensure they have a 
greater investment in Shell's future. The LTIP, also measured over a 
three-year performance period, is used to make long-term share 
incentive awards to Executive Directors, Executive Committee members 
and Senior Executives.
Under the PSP, 50% of the award is linked to certain indicators 
described in "Performance indicators" on pages 27-28, averaged over 
the performance period. For 2020, 11.25% of the award is linked to the 
free cash flow (FCF) measure and 5% is linked to an energy transition 
measure. The remaining 33.75% is linked to the comparative 
performance condition. For 2021 and 2022, 10% of the award is linked 
to the FCF measure and 10% is linked to an energy transition measure. 
The remaining 30% is linked to the comparative performance condition. 
From 2023, 12.5% of the award is linked to an organic FCF measure 
and 12.5% is linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 
25% is linked to the comparative performance condition, which is 
based on two performance measures.
Under the LTIP award made in 2020, 22.5% of the award is linked 
to the FCF measure and 10% is linked to an energy transition measure. 
The remaining 67.5% is linked to the comparative performance 
condition mentioned above. For 2021 and 2022, 20% of the award 
is linked to the FCF measure and 20% is linked to an energy transition 
measure. The remaining 60% is linked to the comparative performance 
condition. From 2023, 25% of the award is linked to an organic FCF 
measure and 25% is linked to an energy transition measure. The 
remaining 50% is linked to the comparative performance condition, 
which is based on two performance measures.
Separately, following the BG acquisition, certain employee share 
awards made in 2015 under BG's Long-term Incentive Plan were 
automatically exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the 
Company. The outstanding awards take the form of nil-cost options. 
Under all plans, all shares that vest are increased by an amount equal 
to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period 
from the award date to the vesting date. In certain circumstances, 
awards may be adjusted before delivery or be subject to clawback 
after delivery. None of the awards results in beneficial ownership 
until the shares vest.
 
See Note 27 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 283. 
Restricted share awards
Restricted Share Awards (awarded under the Shell Share Plan 2014 
and Shell Share Plan 2023) are free share awards made on a highly 
selective basis to senior staff. All shares that vest are increased by 
an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares 
during the period from the award date to the vesting date. In certain 
circumstances, awards may be adjusted before delivery or be subject 
to clawback after delivery. 
Global Employee Share Purchase Plan
Eligible employees in participating countries may participate in the 
Global Employee Share Purchase Plan. This plan enables them to make 
contributions from net pay towards the purchase of the Company's 
shares at a 15% discount to the market price, either at the start or at the 
end of an annual cycle, whichever date offers the lower market price.
UK Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan
Eligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK may 
participate in the Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan, under 
which monthly contributions from gross pay are made towards the 
purchase of the Company's shares. For every six shares purchased 
by the employee, one matching share is provided at no cost to 
the employee.

Safety
Safety
Safety, along with our core values, underpins our Powering Progress 
strategy. We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across 
our operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.
We seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the 
safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal, process 
and transport. We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential 
impact of any incident, with a particular emphasis on the risks with 
the most serious consequences if something goes wrong.
Our multi-year process of refreshing our approach to safety for all 
employees and contractors started in 2020. This approach is rooted 
in a consistent focus on human performance. We ask people at Shell 
to apply a learner mindset, by which we mean the belief that we can 
always improve, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes 
and successes, and speak up freely without repercussions. 
In practice, our refreshed approach to safety is about enhancing 
how we prepare for and conduct high-risk activities by, for example:
￮ executing frontline work: build an environment of trust and learning, 
strengthen team leaders' coaching and engagement skills, and 
embed pre-start work preparations such as those developed by 
the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP);
￮ applying acknowledged industry safety tools: in 2022, we moved 
from the Shell Life-Saving Rules to industry-wide Life-Saving Rules so 
that Shell employees and contractors are working on the same basis 
to manage risks; and
￮ using technology and digital tools to reduce exposure, identify 
conditions that may lead to serious incidents and fatalities, and 
enhance learning.
It is also about capturing more insights from performance analysis by, 
for example:
￮ using metrics focused on serious injuries and fatalities (SIF) and the 
lessons that we can derive from high-potential incidents and events 
that could have led to SIF incidents;
￮ seeking to capture underlying causes and systemic patterns through 
incident investigations; and
￮ aiming to embed lessons learned from the above points in training 
and instructions for work preparation and execution.
In 2023, we integrated this safety approach into the plans of our 
facilities, projects and functions. Many of our non-operated ventures 
and companies that are operated by Shell, but not integrated into 
our systems, have also chosen to implement elements of our 
refreshed approach.
Technology and safety
We are establishing connected ecosystems for data gathering, analysis 
and reporting through the digital transformation of our equipment. 
Digitalisation helps to automate processes so that they can be 
supported remotely, for example, by quickly taking action in the 
event of unsafe situations.
For example, T-Pulse, an AI-automated safety monitoring solution 
developed by the Indian company Detect Technologies, uses CCTV 
feeds to detect unsafe situations, such as fall and fire hazards. It 
identifies and reports real-time safety issues and unsafe behaviours to 
enable urgent conversations, followed by coaching for improvement. 
Shell started to deploy T-Pulse in 2020, and had installed it at 13 sites 
by the end of 2023. By then, it had created alerts for more than 
10,000 situations with potential safety issues. Analysis showed that 
in more than 500 of those situations, an intervention helped to avoid 
potential significant harm to people or leaks to the environment.
Personal safety
We continue to strengthen the safety culture and leadership among 
our employees and contract staff. This aligns with our focus on caring 
for people.
When our employees and contractors perform tasks, we expect them 
to consider the hazards that could potentially cause serious harm and 
the effectiveness of the barriers in place to avoid serious harm. We run 
safety awareness programmes, and hold an annual global Safety 
Day to give employees and contractors time to discuss safety culture 
on the frontline, reflect on how to prevent incidents, and how to 
improve performance.
In 2023, the focus was on "failing safely", which means we recognise 
that people make mistakes and that our barriers need to be capable 
of managing the impact of those mistakes to prevent harm.

In 2023, we achieved safe construction, commissioning and start-up of 
a floating production unit (FPU) for the Shell-operated Vito field (Shell 
interest 63.1%) in the US Gulf of Mexico. The fabrication of another 
FPU, Seatrium, for the Shell-operated Whale field (Shell interest 60%) 
in the Gulf of Mexico, was completed in 2023 after 12 million hours 
without fatality or serious injury.
Process safety
Process safety management is about keeping hazardous substances 
inside pipes, tanks and vessels, and ensuring that well fluids are 
contained during construction, interventions (such as maintenance) 
and incidents. Our Asset Integrity and Process Safety Management 
Principles guide our actions from project design and construction 
throughout the life cycle of facilities to keep sites, employees and 
contractors safe.
Our global standards define our requirements for the identification 
of process safety hazards and the design of controls to prevent the 
release of the identified hazards. For example, offshore wells must be 
designed with at least two independent barriers in the direction of flow 
to reduce the risk of an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons. In the 
event of a spill or a leak, our standards require the use of independent 
recovery measures to reduce the likelihood of a release becoming 
catastrophic. We regularly inspect, test and maintain these barriers 
so that they meet our standards.
Collaboration with industry stakeholders, customers and suppliers is 
critically important to achieve our process safety ambitions. We focus 
on disciplined delivery of our work processes. At the same time, we 
seek to make these work processes more effective through active 
learning, a continuous improvement mindset and striving to create 
a working environment where everyone feels safe to speak up.
The three core pillars to help improve our process safety 
performance are: 
￮ to simplify our risk management by standardising our risk 
assessment tools and make more use of digitalisation;
￮ to embed human performance factors in frontline work 
execution; and
￮ to shift the process safety indicators from lagging to leading 
indicators with a greater focus on the risk potential.
Preparing for emergencies
We prepare and practise our emergency response to incidents, such 
as a spill or a fire. This involves working closely with local emergency 
services and regulatory agencies to jointly test our plans and 
procedures. Shell requires key operating facilities to test their 
emergency response preparedness every three years. In 2023, we 
held four large-scale emergency response exercises at certain assets 
we operate in Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore, the UK and the USA. 
We also supported one large-scale emergency response exercise 
at an asset in Argentina, owned and operated by Raízen, one of 
our joint ventures (Shell interest 44%).
We have set up three regional Emergency Response Leadership 
Councils for the Americas; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, the Middle 
East, and Africa. The councils bring together experts from different 
teams that need to be able to work together seamlessly in case of 
emergencies. In 2023, the councils' annual conferences covered 
a variety of topics such as business continuity, cyber security, 
performance under stress, battery storage emergencies, use 
of drones and competence development. 
Transport safety
Transporting large numbers of people, products and equipment by 
road, rail, sea and air poses safety risks. We seek to reduce these risks 
by developing best-practice standards within Shell. We also work with 
specialist contractors, industry bodies, non-governmental organisations 
and governments to find ways of reducing transport safety risks.
Road safety
In 2023, Shell employees and contractors drove around 464 million 
kilometres on company business. Commercial road transport accounts 
for most of this but only two of this year's 18 severe motor vehicle 
incidents (SMVIs) occurred during commercial road transport. An SMVI 
is defined as a motor vehicle incident resulting in a fatality, serious 
injury or a rollover of a vehicle. Nine SMVIs occurred during business 
travel, two during commercial transport activities and the remaining 
seven during on-site operations. There were no road transport-related 
fatalities in 2023.
In 2023, about 30,600 Shell employees and individual contractor 
colleagues were identified as driving on work-related business, 
and therefore required defensive driver training (DDT). In 2023, 
we launched an internal virtual DDT course to align better with 
industry partners' approaches. 
Addressing driver fatigue
Falling asleep behind the wheel or being distracted while driving 
are amongst the leading causes of road accidents worldwide. 
We worked with four universities to identify suitable devices and 
started deployment in 2020, at the Shell-operated QGC facility 
in Australia.
By the end of 2023, we had installed active fatigue and 
distraction detection (AFDD) devices in around 3,380 vehicles 
operated by Shell or our contractors in countries where road 
transport risks are highest. In 2024, we will continue to install 
AFDD devices in vehicles operated by Shell, including both 
contractor and Shell-owned vehicles. The AFDD devices have 
recorded and intervened in at least 130 high-risk fatigue events, 
preventing what could have resulted in motor vehicle incidents 
if the devices had not alerted the drivers.

Safety at sea
At the end of 2023, we managed and operated a global fleet of 
25 tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and the world's first liquefied 
hydrogen carrier, the Suiso Frontier.

Air safety
In 2023, for Shell-operated ventures, our owned and contracted 
aircraft flew more than 38,000 hours and safely carried more than 
281,000 Shell employees and contractors to destinations across the 
world. In addition, remotely piloted aircraft safely completed almost 
3,400 flight hours on surveys, inspections, emissions surveillance, and 
security and incident response.
See our website shell.com for more information on transport safety.
Working with others
We work with contractors and suppliers to help them understand 
our safety requirements. We strive to improve the energy industry's 
safety performance by sharing safety standards and experience 
with other operators, joint-venture partners, contractors and 
professional organisations. 
In 2023, senior executives from Shell's 23 major global contractors 
joined Shell executives in Norway for our annual Contractor Safety 
Leadership workshop. Focus areas of discussion were worker welfare 
and human rights, mental health and technology solutions for safer 
work at the frontline.
Also in 2023, leadership teams from 25 Shell joint ventures and 
companies newly acquired by Shell met in the Netherlands to discuss 
topics such as worker welfare and related industry standards, and 
the importance of alignment on safety.
Contractor safety
Executives from Shell and our major contractor companies have 
collaborated on Shell's contractor safety leadership (CSL) programme 
since 2014. The programme seeks to identify strategies and practical 
ways to improve a shared safety culture and achieve our Goal Zero 
ambition of no harm and no leaks.

Safety performance
We are deeply saddened to report that four of our contractor 
colleagues in Shell-operated ventures lost their lives in 2023 during the 
course of their work for Shell. An additional contractor colleague who 
was injured in 2023, succumbed to their injuries in February 2024. 
One contractor colleague in Malaysia died during scaffolding work, 
and one in the Philippines died after a fall from height. Two contractor 
colleagues in Nigeria died in a security incident, along with four 
government security agents. In Nigeria, another contractor 
colleague injured in a tugboat fire incident later passed away.
These losses have a deep and far-reaching impact on families, friends 
and colleagues. We are determined to learn from these incidents 
and take steps to prevent something similar from happening again. 
We continue to work closely with our contractors to help build a 
strong safety culture at the frontline.
Several industry safety leadership groups confirm that serious and high-
potential incidents often have different root causes than most lower-
consequence events. The serious injury, illness and fatality frequency 
(SIF-F) enables us to focus our investigations on the most serious 
incidents. The aim is to collect and analyse relevant, high-quality 
data that can help us improve our efforts to prevent serious injuries 
and fatalities.
In 2023, the SIF-F was 2.6 injuries and illnesses per 100 million 
working hours compared with 2.0 in 2022. The SIF-F for 2022 was 
adjusted from 1.7 to 2.0 due to a classification change for one injury 
after publication in March 2023. The number of serious injuries and 
fatalities increased to 12 in 2023 (five fatalities and seven serious injury 
cases) from nine in 2022. Fatalities in 2023 include one contractor 
colleague who was injured in a 2023 incident and unfortunately 
died from their injuries in February 2024.
The number of Tier 1 and 2 operational process safety events in 2023 
decreased compared with 2022. There were 63 incidents reported 
during the year compared with 66 in 2022.
For reporting on process safety, in this Report, we combine Tier 1 and 2 
events. A Tier 1 process safety event is an unplanned or uncontrolled 
release of any material from a process, including non-toxic and non-
flammable materials, with the greatest actual consequence resulting 
in harm to employees, contract staff or a neighbouring community, 
damage to equipment, or exceeding a defined threshold quantity. 
A Tier 2 process safety event is a release of lesser consequence.
In 2023, there were zero Level 1 or Level 2 well control incidents in 
Shell-operated ventures. A well control incident is defined as a well 
set up with less than two barriers in place to protect it against a 
release through any potential path.
As part of Shell's learner mindset approach, we investigate serious 
incidents so we can understand the underlying causes, including 
technical, behavioural, organisational and human factors. We share 
what we learn, including with contractors. We implement mitigations 
at the site and in the country and business where the incident occurred. 
We seek to turn incident findings into improved standards or better 
ways of working that can be applied widely across similar facilities.
See our 2023 Shell Sustainability Report for more information about our 
safety performance.
Security
Our operations expose us to criminality, civil unrest, activism, terrorism, 
cyber disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse 
effect on our business (see "Risk factors" on page 22). We seek to 
obtain the best possible information to enable us to assess threats 
and risks. 
We conduct detailed threat and risk assessments for our Shell-operated 
venture assets, facilities, business, projects and activities so that security 
risk mitigations achieve the principles of deter, detect, delay and 
respond. Further mitigations include strengthening the security of 
assets, reducing our exposure as appropriate and using journey 
management plans. We also invest in information risk management 
capabilities and crisis management and business continuity measures. 
We learn from incidents, in order to continually improve our security 
risk management in Shell.
To help us understand the threats, we build strong and open 
relationships with government, law enforcement, military forces, 
industry peers and specialist security information providers. On 
the basis of these threat assessments, we identify security risks to 
employees, assets, including information technology equipment, and 
operations. We then seek to manage the risks so they are as low as 
reasonably practicable. Risk mitigation includes strengthening the 
security of sites, reducing our exposure to threats as appropriate, 
journey management, information risk management and cyber defence 
operations, crisis management and business continuity measures. 
We conduct training and awareness campaigns for employees, and 
provide them with travel advice and access to 24/7 assistance while 
travelling. We consistently verify the identity of our employees and 
contract staff, we control physical access to our sites and activities, 
and we document access with digital tools. We take steps to have 
clear and planned responses to security incidents, so that we are 
able to react quickly and effectively if they occur.
Shell is a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights initiative. This is a multi-stakeholder initiative of governments, 
extractive sector industries and NGOs that gives guidance on how to 
respect human rights, while providing security for business operations. 
Shell implements this guidance across its companies, concentrating 
on countries where the risks of working with state and private security 
forces are greatest.
In the EC, accountability for security matters sits with the Chief Human 
Resources and Corporate Officer.

Living by 
our values
Our core values of honesty, integrity, and 
respect for people, as well as our focus 
on safety and sustainability are critical to 
our strategy. We are committed to doing 
business in an ethical and transparent way.
Ethics and transparency
Our core values underpin our work with employees, customers, 
investors, contractors, suppliers, NGOs, the communities where we 
operate and others. The Shell General Business Principles, Code of 
Conduct and Ethics and Compliance Manual help everyone at Shell 
act in line with our values.
Shell General Business Principles 
The Shell General Business Principles (SGBP) set out our responsibilities 
to shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and society. 
They set the standards for how we conduct business with integrity, 
care and respect for people. As part of these principles, we commit to 
contribute to sustainable development, balancing short- and long-term 
interests and integrating economic, environmental and social 
considerations into our decision-making. All Shell employees and 
contractors, and those at joint ventures we operate, are expected to 
behave in line with these business principles. The company undertakes 
a range of activities to help embed the SGBP within the organisation. 
These include training and encouraging people to discuss the dilemmas 
they face in their work.
Code of Conduct 
The Shell Code of Conduct explains how employees, contractors and 
anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our 
business principles. It covers safety, anti-bribery and corruption, fair 
competition, human rights and other important areas. Shell employees, 
contractors and third parties can report any potential breaches of the 
Code of Conduct confidentially through several channels, including 
anonymously through a global helpline operated by an independent 
provider. We maintain a stringent no retaliation policy to protect any 
person making an allegation in good faith.
In 2023, there were 2,134 reports to the Shell Global Helpline. Of 
those, 254 cases were confirmed breaches of the Code of Conduct, 
278 employees or contractor staff were subject to disciplinary action, 
and 66 people were dismissed. 
Data protection
Over the last decade, the Shell Group has continued to invest in and 
develop a mature and robust privacy compliance programme based 
on our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). These rules are perceived as 
a positive mechanism by data privacy regulators for enabling lawful 
data sharing and demonstrating accountability within large corporate 
groups. The BCRs allow intra-group transfers of personal data without 
needing to enter into additional complex intra-group agreements. The 
overall objective of the programme is to enable the Shell Group of 
companies to collect, handle and manage personal data in a 
professional, ethical and lawful manner.
Shell's Chief Privacy Officer serves as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) 
under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other 
applicable data privacy laws, except where there is a requirement to 
have a locally based DPO, such as in China and the Philippines. 
Our staff receive guidance on the requirements in Shell's Ethics and 
Compliance Manual, on an internal website focusing on data privacy, 
training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages 
from Shell leaders on the importance of managing data privacy risks. 
We monitor new and imminent data privacy legislation and seek to 
ensure we have a robust impact assessment process in place for the 
relevant businesses. We design our operations and processes based 
on relevant data privacy requirements and we build controls into our 
processes and practices which cover the handling of personal data. 
We maintain a Group-wide incident management process designed to 
immediately identify and remediate data privacy breaches. The process 
also helps us to comply with country-level requirements for reporting 
breaches. Some of our acquired companies are not yet in full compliance 
with our BCRs. Following assessments for each of those companies, 
specific actions are planned and put in place to achieve compliance, 
with regular updates made on their progress to management.
Anti-bribery and corruption 
Shell has rules on anti-bribery and corruption in its Code of Conduct 
and Ethics and Compliance Manual. 
We maintain an anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion and anti-money 
laundering (ABC/AML) programme, with adequate resources, a 
comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. 
Staff receive guidance on the requirements listed in Shell's Ethics and 
Compliance Manual, an ABC/AML-specific website, training modules 
where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell 
leaders on the importance of managing ABC/AML risks. 
Shell has around 25,000 suppliers worldwide. We offer free training 
in anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices to selected suppliers and 
contractors. This training is available in 14 languages. In 2023, we 
offered training to 131 third-party organisations in 16 countries.

Antitrust and competition laws
We maintain an antitrust compliance programme with adequate 
resources, a comprehensive governance structure and established 
reporting lines. Staff receive guidance on the requirements listed in 
Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, an internal antitrust-specific 
website, training modules where completion is monitored and 
messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing antitrust 
risks. Staff must understand and comply with the Protect Shell Policy, 
which explains Shell's position on managing antitrust risks in 
engagements with parties external to Shell. In response to fast-
moving external antitrust developments and trends, internal guidance 
is continually being monitored to ensure that it remains relevant.
Compliance in our Trading and Supply business
We maintain a Trading Compliance function managed by a Chief 
Compliance Officer, as regulated by the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA), the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission 
(CFTC) and the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) 
with adequate resources, including employees and budget; a 
comprehensive governance structure, including mitigating control 
measures; and established reporting lines. Employees in Shell's 
Trading organisation receive clear guidance through the Shell 
Code of Conduct; the organisation's Trading Compliance Manual 
supplemented with specific policies; a specific internal compliance 
website; mandatory training modules where completion is monitored 
and additional training sessions. Shell leaders reinforce the importance 
of managing compliance and conduct risk in the trading organisation. 
Shell's Trading Compliance function has a dedicated monitoring and 
surveillance team, which has systems for trade surveillance and 
monitoring communications.
Trade compliance and sanctions
We continue to develop and maintain a trade compliance programme 
with adequate resources, robust screening protocols, a comprehensive 
governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive 
guidance on the requirements listed in Shell's Ethics and Compliance 
Manual, a specific website for trade compliance, training modules 
where completion is monitored and messages from Shell leaders on 
the importance of managing trade compliance risks. The effectiveness 
of the programme is assessed annually (more frequently if necessary) 
and we are continually seeking ways to improve it.
Reputation and brand
We continually assess and monitor the external environment for 
potential risks to our reputation. We engage in dialogue with our key 
stakeholders, such as investors, industry and trade groups, academics, 
governments and non-governmental organisations to gain greater 
insights into societal expectations of the Shell Group of companies. 
We also take proactive steps when warranted, through legal means 
to protect our reputation from unwarranted accusations. We have 
mitigation plans for identified individual risks at the Group, country 
and line of business level. Our country chairs are responsible for 
implementing country plans which are updated annually. We 
continually develop and defend our brand in line with Shell's 
purpose and target our efforts to drive brand differentiation, 
relevance and preference.
Our approach to sustainability
Our commitment to contribute to sustainable development has 
been part of the Shell General Business Principles since 1997. These

business and to our conduct with the communities where we operate. 
We have embedded this sustainability commitment in our Powering 
Progress strategy, and our business and decision-making processes.
Sustainability reporting boundary and guidelines
Data in the Respecting nature, Powering lives, Safety and Living by our 
values sections are reported on a 100% basis in respect of activities 
where a Shell company is the operator (unless noted otherwise). 
Reporting on an operational control basis differs from that applied for 
financial reporting purposes in the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
on pages 217-290. Find additional information on our environmental 
and social performance in our 2023 Shell Sustainability Report 
expected to be published in March 2024.
Our reporting on sustainability follows certain guidelines. For example:
￮ As a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, we support its updated criteria for membership from 
2022, which include requirements for corporate transparency.
￮ Our reporting is informed by guidelines developed by Ipieca, the 
global oil and gas association for advancing environmental and 
social performance across the energy transition.
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
Governments are responsible for prioritising and implementing 
approaches that meet the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). We strive to play our part in helping governments and 
societies achieve the SDGs and these were one of the considerations 
in the development of our Powering Progress strategy. We believe the 
actions we take as part of our strategy can help directly contribute 
to 13 of the SDGs, while indirectly contributing to others. 
Board oversight for sustainability
We describe Shell's overall governance framework on pages 149-154 
and provide information on the roles of the Board, its committees, and 
the Executive Committee. The Sustainability Committee (SUSCO) is one 
of the four standing committees of the Board of Directors of Shell plc. 
The SUSCO's responsibilities are to review the progress of Shell with 
respect to sustainability and the non-financial elements of our Powering 
Progress strategy.
See pages 160-161 for information about SUSCO and its activities.
The Annual Report on Remuneration (see pages 177-193) provides 
details of how the Shell scorecard captures key performance indicators 
for safety, environment and climate.

HSSE & SP Control Framework
In Shell, health, safety, security, environment, and social performance 
(HSSE & SP) are vitally important to generating value. They are 
indispensable elements of our organisation. We have internal 
standards and a clear governance structure to help manage HSSE & 
SP risks and avoid potential adverse effects. These also help us to 
develop mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring that if an HSSE & SP 
risk materialises, we avoid the worst possible consequences and have 
ways to remediate any environmental damage. The Shell HSSE & SP 
Control Framework (CF) consists of mandatory manuals, which align 
with the Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP. Guidance 
documents, assurance protocols, and training materials support the 
implementation of the manuals. Our standards describe how key 
control processes need to be implemented, for example, to help make 
production safer and manage the care of equipment. The HSSE & SP 
CF applies to every Shell entity and Shell-operated venture. It defines 
requirements and accountabilities at each organisational level, setting 
expectations for the management of HSSE & SP risks. We aim to 
ensure that significant HSSE & SP risks associated with our business 
activities are assessed and managed to minimise them as far as 
reasonably practicable. Our subject matter experts provide advice 
and support businesses to improve HSSE & SP performance. The 
applicability of specific HSSE & SP CF requirements to contractors 
depends on the defined HSSE & SP risks of the material or services 
procured as determined by the contracting Shell entity in the context 
of the HSSE & SP CF. Contractors are required, through appropriate 
contract provisions, to adhere to either Shell requirements and 
standards, or applicable industry standards.
When planning new major projects, we conduct detailed 
environmental, social and health impact assessments. We routinely 
practice implementing our emergency response plans to potential 
events such as spills or fire, which pose a significant risk. The Shell 
Internal Audit & Investigation team provides assurance on the 
HSSE & SP controls to the Audit and Risk Committee.
Safety, Environment & Asset Management 
(SEAM) Standards
Our health, safety, security, environment, and social 
performance standards and governance structure are currently 
defined in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social 
Performance (HSSE & SP) Control Framework and supporting 
guidance documents. 
We will begin transitioning to our new Safety, Environment & 
Asset Management (SEAM) Standards, which come into effect 
from July 1, 2024. This is part of the Shell Performance 
Framework, which is the overarching framework adopted by 
Shell to deliver on its strategy. Implementation of migration to 
the SEAM Standards, pursuant to guidance on expectations 
and process, will continue throughout 2024 into 2025.
Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Social Performance Control Framework
The HSSE & SP Control Framework defines mandatory standards, requirements and accountabilities. 
The framework applies to Shell entities and Shell-operated ventures, including employees and contractors.

Assurance
The Shell Internal Audit & Investigations (SIAI) team is the single 
independent assurance organisation within Shell. Within SIAI, 
the HSSE & SP and Asset Management Assurance team provides 
assurance to the Board's Audit and Risk Committee on the 
effectiveness of the HSSE & SP CF through an audit programme. 
We take care to invest responsibly in the energy transition and screen 
investments against multiple criteria. We expect joint ventures not 
operated by Shell to apply standards and principles substantially 
equivalent to our own and support them in doing so. We offer to help 
them review the effectiveness of their implementation. Even if a review 
is not conducted, we periodically evaluate HSSE & SP risks faced by 
the ventures that we do not operate. If a venture does not meet our 
HSSE & SP expectations, we seek to improve performance by working 
with our partners to develop and implement remedial action plans. 
Divestments
When considering divestments, we collaborate with in-house and 
external experts, where appropriate, to conduct checks and examine 
key attributes of potential buyers. These attributes may include their 
financial strength, operating culture, HSSE policies and approach to 
ethics and compliance. We also consider risk management and people 
management processes and standards, community liaison practices, 
and social performance programmes.
Applicable attributes are assessed against Shell's policies and relevant 
local regulations. Divestments are often subject to the approval of 
regulators, which may in part depend on potential buyers' HSSE 
capacity, compliance record and asset stewardship capabilities.
See the section "Risk management and controls" on page 151 for more information.
Decommissioning and restoration
Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas 
structure. We work hard to close and dispose of installations in a safe, 
efficient, cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner. This 
includes restoring the surroundings of platforms and facilities in line with 
relevant legislation, while taking our own standards into account. We 
have decommissioning and restoration activities under way in Brazil, 
Brunei, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. We seek to reuse, 
repurpose and recycle materials in decommissioning. At the end of 
2023, we reported $19 billion on our balance sheet for current and 
non-current decommissioning and other provisions. 
See Note 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 275-276.
Shell invests in innovative decommissioning and restoration 
technologies both in-house and by funding third parties. For example, 
in the Netherlands, we have developed technology to deep-clean 
hazardous contaminants from unused pipelines. This allows us to sell 
the pipelines for reuse, such as piping hydrogen, or recycle them as 
part of our ambitions on circularity.
See the business sections on pages 39-79 for more information.

Changes to the Executive Committee (Senior Management) in 2023
As announced on January 30, 2023, Shell reduced the size of its Executive 
Committee (EC) from nine to seven members in a move designed to simplify the 
organisation further and improve performance as we continue to deliver our 
Powering Progress strategy.
Under the changes, which took effect on July 1, 2023, Shell's Integrated Gas and 
Upstream businesses were combined to form a new Integrated Gas and Upstream 
Directorate, led by Zoe Yujnovich. The Downstream business was combined with 
Renewables and Energy Solutions to form a new Downstream, Renewables and 
Energy Solutions Directorate, led by Huibert Vigeveno.
Separately, the Strategy, Sustainability and Corporate Relations Directorate was 
discontinued and its Director, Ed Daniels, stepped down from the EC and left 
Group service. Strategy was brought together with New Business Development 
and, alongside Sustainability, now reports directly to CFO Sinead Gorman, 
enabling more streamlined planning and better capital allocation decisions. 
Harry Brekelmans, previously Projects & Technology Director, and Donny Ching, 
previously Legal Director, stepped down from their roles and left Group service. 
Robin Mooldijk succeeded Harry as Projects & Technology Director, and Philippa 
Bounds became Legal Director.
Ronan Cassidy stepped down as Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer 
and left Group service. Ronan was succeeded by Rachel Solway.

Corporate governance requirements outside the UK
In addition to complying with applicable corporate governance 
requirements in the UK, the Company complies with the rules of 
Euronext Amsterdam and Dutch securities laws because of its listing 
on that exchange. The Company, likewise, adheres to US securities 
laws and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations 
because its securities are registered in the USA and listed on the NYSE.
Board activities
The Board works to a yearly meeting plan with corresponding agendas 
and reading materials, provided digitally in advance of meetings, 
to support the Board in its oversight of the Group's operations and 
management. Standing agenda items include reports from the CEO, 
the CFO and the Chair of each Board committee. Other updates 
throughout the year come from various businesses and key functions, 
including Investor Relations; Health and Safety, Security and 
Environment; Information Technology; Human Resources; and Legal, 
as well as the Company Secretary. The Board also considers and 
approves the quarterly, half-year and full-year financial results, 
shareholder distributions and the associated announcements, and, 
at most meetings, considers investment, divestment and/or financing 
proposals. It also conducts post-investment reviews and performance 
tracking, as and when required. Additionally, the Board reviews 
the Group's annual operating plan, including activities undertaken 
designed to meet the Group's carbon reduction targets. To enable 
purposeful debates and focus on particular aspects of agenda 
topics, including the impact on key stakeholders, Directors have 
an opportunity to specify information they require to be provided 
in advance of Board meetings.
During the year, where possible, certain Non-executive Directors 
conduct site visits. The visits are designed to provide them with a 
deeper insight into certain business operations.
Board Strategy Days
The Board held its Strategy Days during June 2023. These were held in 
person in Canada over three days. The programme for the event aimed 
at having engaging and interactive sessions with both internal and 
external stakeholders. These included employees, customers, suppliers, 
regional country chairs and other key stakeholders.
The event focused on Shell's energy transition strategy in Canada. 
The Board and EC members conducted a deep dive on the strategic 
elements that would inform Shell's Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24). Around this theme, the event provided for the following 
key discussion and engagement opportunities:
￮ An in-depth discussion on strategy and business implementation, 
with an emphasis on the growth potential and dilemmas of Shell's 
businesses in Canada;
￮ Engagements with experts shaping the energy and climate policy 
in Canada;
￮ Discussions of the opportunities and challenges inherent in ETS24; 
￮ Discussions on Canada's perspective on the energy transition and its 
geopolitical context, including engagement with Shell leaders from 
across the country;
￮ A review of growing our sustainable future safely and competitively 
where presenters included a cross section of business and site staff;
￮ A site visit to LNG Canada (under construction on the west coast of 
Canada), which included engagements with the leaders of the 
Haisla Nation in their community of Kitimat and Mayor Phil Germuth 
of Kitimat; 
￮ Engagements with a cross section of Shell's workforce in Canada 
who work across a range of key businesses and functions;
￮ Discussions with key customers and stakeholders in the region; and 
￮ Discussion of core elements of the Powering Progress strategy.
Director induction and training
After being appointed to the Board, Directors receive a comprehensive 
induction tailored to their individual needs. This normally includes site 
visits and meetings with Senior Management to enable them to build up a 
detailed understanding of Shell's business and strategy, and the key risks 
and issues that Shell faces. Existing Directors are also able to join these 
visits to keep abreast of business developments and progress. In 2023, 
we continued with a hybrid format, making the best use of the Directors' 
time through digital and physical engagements. Onboarding will continue 
to be phased and prioritised based on forthcoming Board agenda items 
to ensure new Non-executive Directors hit the ground running. 
A digital onboarding book is provided to each new Non-executive 
Director. These onboarding books complement the existing digital 
Directors' Handbook and feature: 
￮ Overviews of scheduled briefing meetings customised to the Non-
executive Directors' needs and linked to upcoming Board agenda 
items;
￮ Hyperlinks to key Shell publications (external and internal);
￮ Lists of common Shell acronyms;
￮ Key current materials on:
– Shell's safety and core values; 
– Board governance;
– Group strategy and portfolio; 
– Key businesses and functions; and
– Climate change and energy transition.
￮ Biographies of key executives;
￮ Other elements of the onboarding programme for Non-executive 
Directors include:
– Briefing meetings with key executives (both business and functional) 
customised to Non-executive Directors' needs and phased based on 
forthcoming Board agenda items;
– Pairing up new Non-executive Directors in onboarding briefings to 
optimise learning while also providing opportunities for collegial 
relationship-building and increasing efficiencies for the executives; 
and
– Virtual and physical site visits (either specifically for onboarding or 
by inviting the new Directors to committees' site visits).

Senior Succession and Resourcing Review
The annual Senior Succession and Resourcing Review focused on the strength 
of senior leadership and plans for its development and succession, while 
highlighting the breadth, depth and diversity of its pipeline, the developing 
profile of the leadership cadre, and recruitment and attrition levels.
The Senior Succession and Resourcing Review also highlighted the effectiveness 
of succession planning, the impact of its associated execution, and the data-
driven, integrated approach to leadership and leadership development. The 
review continues to focus on proactive management of Shell's talent pipeline, 
and on advancing Shell's diversity agenda with increased attention on gender, 
race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disabilities.
Risk management and controls
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining procedures 
to manage risk, overseeing the internal control framework, and 
determining the nature and extent of the principal risks that Shell is 
willing to take in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives. 
In 2023, we introduced the Shell Performance Framework to enhance 
the control framework in which Shell operates. This new framework, as 
shown in the diagram below, retains the core strengths of the previous 
Shell Control Framework, including the Shell General Business 
Principles, Code of Conduct and risk management fundamentals. 
However, the Shell Performance Framework also emphasises the value 
of using a holistic or "whole systems" approach to business activities 
along with the role that culture plays in achieving Shell's objectives.
The Shell Performance Framework
The Shell Performance Framework supports the delivery of sustainable business outcomes. In pursuit of this, consideration is given to both the 
context in which Shell operates and key elements of direction-setting, including, for example, Shell's strategy and the Shell General Business 
Principles.
Delivery of the desired outcomes is then pursued by leveraging our Performance Culture, i.e., the shared values, practices and beliefs of our 
employees. This is influenced by decisions on:
￮ Structure and Accountability – how we are organised and governed and the associated roles and responsibilities;
￮ People and Skills – our workforce composition, such as its size, diversity and location, and the skills required to deliver Shell's objectives;
￮ Processes and Systems – how we transform inputs into outputs in a controlled manner, leveraging data and systems as appropriate. This 
also includes the standards that further define the boundaries within which Shell operates;
￮ Mindset and Behaviours – this includes the role of leadership and Shell's values, beliefs and behaviours, as set out, for example, in the 
Code of Conduct.
At the heart of the Shell Performance Framework is the Improvement Cycle, which integrates performance management, risk management, 
including controls and assurance, learning and improvement. It follows a "Plan-Do-Check-Adjust" approach and helps to drive a consistent 
way of working and improving.
The Shell Performance Framework is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve our business objectives. It 
provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.

Risk management 
As outlined above, risk management is a key component of the 
Improvement Cycle, which emphasises its integration with performance, 
learning and improvement.
Risk identification
We identify and define risks across the spectrum of strategic, 
operational and conduct and culture risks. With strategic risks, we 
consider current and future portfolio issues, examining parameters such 
as country concentration or exposure to higher-risk countries. We also 
consider long-range developments in order to test key assumptions or 
beliefs in relation to energy markets. When assessing operational risks, 
we consider material operational exposures across Shell's entire value 
chain which provide a more granular assessment of key risks facing the 
organisation. Through conduct and culture risks, we consider how our 
policies and practices align with our purpose, core values and desired 
mindset and behaviours.
These perspectives help us to maintain a comprehensive view of the 
different types of risks we face and the different time horizons in which 
they may affect us.
 
See "Risk factors" on pages 17-26.
Risk assessment
To further understand the risks we face, we evaluate the impact and 
likelihood of each risk.
When assessing the potential impact of a risk, we consider the possible 
financial consequences. We also look at the impacts on our reputation, 
our ability to comply with external regulations and impacts on health, 
safety and the environment.
When assessing the likelihood of a risk occurring, we consider several 
factors, such as the level of risk exposure, our ability to prevent the risk 
happening and whether the risk has materialised in the past. 
To support risk assessments, we also seek to establish and articulate 
our risk appetite, which is the level of risk that we are willing to accept 
in pursuit of Shell's strategy and objectives. There are risks that Shell 
accepts, or does not seek to fully mitigate. The financial framework, 
which shapes Shell's financial resilience, sets an overarching boundary 
condition for risk appetite. 
The impact and likelihood assessments, combined with risk appetite, 
determine the type of risk responses, such as controls and assurance 
activities, that may be required to manage each risk. The impact and 
likelihood assessments also help us to prioritise risks.
Risk response
Risk responses, including appropriate processes and controls, are 
developed taking into account the requirements and guidance in, 
among others, the Shell General Business Principles and the Code 
of Conduct as well as our Group Standards, which establish the 
mandatory rules that need to be followed on specific risks. We use 
assurance activities to objectively assess the effectiveness of, and to 
improve, our risk management activities.
Examples of how some principal risks are managed
We operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees 
of political, legal and economic stability. This exposes us to a 
wide range of political developments that could cause changes 
to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We and our joint 
arrangements and associates also face the risk of litigation 
and disputes worldwide (see "Risk factors" on page 19). We 
continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal 
issues relevant to our interests. Our Legal and Tax functions are 
organised globally and support our business lines in seeking to 
ensure compliance with local laws and fiscal regulations, and filing 
proactive claims where warranted to protest unfair practices. 
Our Corporate Relations department liaises with governments in 
countries where we operate to understand and engage on local 
policies and to advocate Shell's position on topics relevant to 
our industry. We are prepared to exit a country if we believe we 
can no longer operate there in accordance with our standards and 
applicable law, and we have done so in the past. With regard to 
the conflict in Gaza, we have made adjustments to our operations 
in the Middle East to reduce our exposure and are closely 
monitoring the risk of a wider regional escalation.
An erosion of our business reputation could have a material 
adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new 
hydrocarbon or low-carbon opportunities or access capital 
markets, and on our licence to operate (see "Risk factors" on page 
19). We continually assess and monitor the external environment 
for potential risks to our reputation. We engage in ongoing 
dialogue with our key stakeholders such as investors, industry and 
trade groups, universities, governments and non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) to gain greater insights into societal 
expectations of our business. We have mitigation plans for 
identified individual risks at the Group, country and line of business 
level. Our country chairs are responsible for implementing country 
plans which are updated annually. We continually develop and 
defend our brand in line with Shell's purpose and promises, and 
target our investments to drive brand differentiation, relevance 
and preference. 
Many of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint 
arrangements or with associates, which may reduce our level of 
control and ability to identify and manage risks (see "Risk factors" 
on page 24). For every major project where we share control, 
Shell appoints a Joint Venture Asset Manager, whose 
responsibility is to manage performance and create and protect 
value for Shell. The Joint Venture Asset Manager seeks to influence 
operators and other partners to adapt their practices in order to 
drive value appropriately and to mitigate identified risks. An 
annual review assesses how the joint venture's standards and 
processes align with those of Shell. The Joint Venture Asset 
Manager follows up on any gaps identified.
In response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a Group 
Crisis Team was set up to assess the situation, consider potential 
scenarios of how events may further develop and coordinate 
responses accordingly (see "Risk factors" on page 19). The team 
continue to play an oversight and cross-coordination role across 
Shell's different lines of businesses. Care for our people remains 
Shell's top priority. We continue to closely monitor and respond 
to the sanctions that have been imposed and follow international 
guidelines where relevant to our business activities. Shell no longer 
participates in any joint ventures with Gazprom and related 
entities with ongoing operations inside Russia. Shell has also 
exited all its downstream business (including services stations, 
fuels supply and lubricants) in Russia.

Emerging risks
Management and the Board also consider emerging risks, defined as 
risks where the scope, impact and likelihood are still uncertain, but 
which could have a significant effect on achieving Shell's strategy and 
objectives in the future. These risks are identified through the monitoring 
of external developments, the status of risk indicators, learnings from 
incidents and assurance findings, and the appraisal of Shell's forward-
looking plans. Once identified, we undertake activities to monitor, 
prepare for and reduce the future impact, where possible, should 
such emerging risks materialise.
In 2023, management and the Board identified Artificial Intelligence as 
an emerging risk, given the evolving regulatory landscape associated 
with this technology and its potential impacts, for example, on cyber 
intrusion and data protection.
Board review of principal and emerging risks
The Board confirms it has carried out a robust assessment of Shell's 
principal risks, including a robust process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing these principal risks. The Board also confirms it has carried 
out a robust assessment of Shell's emerging risks. These assessments 
have been in place throughout 2023 and up to the date of this Report, 
are reviewed by the Board and accord with the Financial Reporting 
Council guidance on risk management, internal control and related 
financial and business reporting.
Review of the effectiveness of the system of risk 
management and internal control
The Board has delegated authority to the Audit and Risk Committee 
(ARC) to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control system, 
the integrity of financial reporting, and consideration of 
compliance matters. 
 
See "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 162-173.
The ARC receives regular reports from the Chief Internal Auditor 
on notable internal audits and those with a significant impact on the 
effectiveness of controls. The ARC reviews significant incidents involving 
financial, operational and compliance controls and receives regular 
reports on business integrity issues. The ARC also requests updates 
on specific financial, operational and compliance control issues 
throughout the year. It is helped with its monitoring and review 
responsibilities by the reports of:
￮ the Executive Vice President Controller;
￮ the Chief Internal Auditor;
￮ the External Auditors;
￮ the Chairs of the Disclosure Committee and the Financial Reporting 
Control Committee; and
￮ the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer; 
￮ as well as summaries of the Annual Proved Reserves Disclosure.
The Chair of the ARC provides regular updates to the Board after 
each of its meetings. These updates cover, among other matters, the 
respective aspects of controls that it monitors in accordance with its 
Terms of Reference. During and after such sessions, the Board has the 
opportunity to request further information and ask clarifying questions. 
The Board also receives the approved minutes of the ARC. This 
helps the Board with its ongoing monitoring and annual review 
of material controls.
The Executive Committee and the ARC conduct an annual review of 
the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. 
This is based on their own insights and experience during the year, the 
outcomes of the Group-level risk reviews and the Group Assurance 
Letter process. As part of the latter, each Executive Director conducts 
a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal and ethical 
requirements and the Shell Performance Framework.
As part of their annual review, the Executive Committee and ARC 
also consider input from the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer, Executive Vice President Controller and the 
External Auditor. The Board reviews and discusses the insights and 
conclusions from this annual assessment.
The Board confirms that it has conducted its annual review of the 
effectiveness of Shell's system of risk management and internal control 
in respect of 2023, and that this review covered all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls.
Risks
The Board reviewed reports on Shell's top risks, external and internal trends and 
emerging risks.
Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Report
Data and insights include information from the Global Helpline, the Shell 
Ethics and Compliance organisation and the Shell People Survey. The SUSCO 
continues to strongly support the work of the Chief Ethics and Compliance 
Officer, including the efforts to ensure a safe working environment where staff 
feel confident to raise any concerns in good faith.
The ARC is kept updated when matters highlighted through the Global Helpline 
are investigated. The ARC is also informed about the associated remediation. 
For more information see "Audit and Risk Committee Report".
Assurance activities
Assurance activities, including items raised by businesses and functions (through 
the Group Assurance Letters process) and assurance (from Internal Audit, HSSE, 
Ethics and Compliance, Reserves Assurance and Reporting), provide additional 
evidence to the Board of the commitment to high standards of risk management 
and internal control. The assurance activities ensure that work can be done 
safely, within regulatory frameworks.
The information provided within these reports further supports the Board's annual 
review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management 
and internal control, and feeds into the Group scorecard, against which staff 
bonuses are calculated.

Board review process
For 2023, it was recommended that the NOMCO conduct an 
internally facilitated questionnaire-based Board and committee 
evaluation. This was because of several Board effectiveness initiatives 
under way and an in-depth Board dynamics exercise, to be conducted 
in 2024.
Board members responded to questionnaires shared at the end of 
2023, with the results being discussed at the January 2024 Board and 
committee meetings. Separate questionnaires were produced for the 
evaluation of the Chair, and the Board committees. In addition, the 
Chair held separate one-to-one discussions with each of the Directors 
to assess their individual performance during the year. To broaden the 
inputs into the evaluation process, members of the EC participated in 
the evaluation process, also completing questionnaires relating to their 
attendance at Board meetings.
The Company Secretary produced a feedback summary providing 
recommendations to the Directors. This report was shared with the 
Chair and committee Chairs and subsequently all Board members.
Insight
The feedback from the Board Directors was positive throughout their 
responses to the evaluation. Views were provided on: composition and 
dynamics; skills, capabilities and competencies; support and challenge; 
atmosphere in the room; the support the Board and Board committees 
receive; strategic focus; risk management and oversight; stakeholder 
engagement; and any priorities for change
Board dynamics
In 2024, the Board plans to undertake a Board dynamics review. The 
review will be structured to identify the current state of Board practices, 
focusing on what works well and any factors which could be improved 
to accelerate effectiveness. Our Chief Human Resources and 
Corporate Officer and the Company Secretary will lead the review. 
The approach will be structured to provide ongoing maintenance and 
improvement of Board dynamics with continued support and input 
from the Directors.
Management and focus of meetings
The output from the 2023 Board evaluation highlighted the need for 
the Board's collective continued focus on the implementation of ETS24, 
and the continued delivery of plans outlined at Capital Markets Day 
(CMD) in June 2023. The continued optimisation and integration of the 
work of both the Board and the ARC on risk-related matters were also 
noted as continued areas of focus for 2024.
Overall, the Board was found to be functioning well, with a high level 
of commitment from both the Non-executive and Executive Directors. 
Improvements identified were to fine-tune an already effective Board. 
There are good personal relationships, amid a collegial spirit, with a 
high degree of mutual respect. Directors are able to share opinions and 
guidance and feel that they are heard. The agenda has been broad 
and the committees have complemented the Board agenda to ensure 
that the Board has covered the areas viewed to be key.
Feedback themes for the committees 
The committees were considered to be well-chaired and well-operated 
and received excellent input from Senior Management. All committee 
reviews provided focus on the meeting management and effectiveness, 
oversight, and performance improvement. Each individual committee 
analysed topics specific to the forum. The committees also provided 
feedback on the implementation of recommendations from the 2022 
evaluation process. 
Chair evaluation
The Chair was considered to have built and maintained strong 
relationships with the CEO, CFO and the Non-executive Directors. 
He was also thought to be very good at drawing out individual views 
in the room and keen to listen to views from all Directors. References 
to his knowledge, accessibility and support were made and these 
are valued across the Board.
Delivery against the 2023 ambitions
Several Board effectiveness initiatives were implemented and undertaken 
in 2023. The Board continued to focus on being a well-functioning Board 
and spent additional time on strategic matters. It placed an even greater 
focus on Shell's key stakeholders around the world. In line with this, the 
Board refreshed its agendas. It also implemented an initiative to enhance 
the quality of Board pre-reading materials to better support its priorities 
on strategy and enable it to use its time as effectively as possible.
Leadership changes to both the composition and structure of the EC 
were implemented, which has simplified the organisation structure.
The Board undertook a more strategic review of the committees' 
agendas and remit to ensure alignment with the Board's priorities and 
longer-term aspirations. The composition and the terms of reference of 
each committee were updated as a result of this work with the Audit 
Committee being redesignated the Audit and Risk Committee, and the 
Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee being redesignated 
the Sustainability Committee. In addition, the Board reviewed the 
general information provided to Directors during their onboarding 
and throughout the year to ensure that all Directors achieve sufficient 
knowledge and understanding of the organisation, while balancing 
this against the volume of the materials provided. 
Further, the NOMCO reviewed its Principles for the Strategic 
Composition of the Board to ensure these continue to reflect 
the strategic and diversity requirements of the Board.

Purpose
The Nomination and Succession Committee (the "NOMCO") leads the 
process for appointments to the Board and Senior Management [A] 
positions, ensures plans are in place for orderly, well-planned 
succession, and oversees the development of a diverse succession 
pipeline of candidates. It also reviews the Company's policy, targets 
and strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and monitors 
the effectiveness of these initiatives. It makes recommendations to 
the Board on corporate governance guidelines.
[A] In this section of the report, "Senior Management" refers to the Executive Committee 
and the Company Secretary, as defined by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Talent management and succession
The NOMCO is fully engaged with the end-to-end talent management 
and senior succession planning approach that is deployed within Shell. 
It plays a key role in senior succession and resourcing. Retaining in-
depth knowledge of the individuals within the talent pipeline is a 
NOMCO priority. The NOMCO makes time to personally meet and 
engage with numerous individuals within the pipeline. The NOMCO's 
oversight and input extend from recruitment to leadership identification 
and from leadership development to leadership appointment, all of 
which are underpinned by clearly articulated talent priorities and a 
commitment to advancing DE&I across Shell.
The NOMCO manages Board and supports Senior Management 
succession under a structured, proactive methodology. The processes 
have clear and agreed selection principles for short-, medium- and long-
term succession and are aligned with Shell's strategic priorities.
For Non-executive Director succession, the NOMCO continues to 
follow its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, adding 
factors as they evolve. These principles include both quantitative and 
qualitative principles, considering:
￮ the overall aspired Board composition and diversity of age; gender; 
race; ethnicity; educational, social, geographical and professional 
backgrounds; skills; knowledge; and experience that align with the 
Company's strategy including amongst other criteria consideration 
of the skills and strengths needed for the energy transition; and
￮ the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected of Directors.
Governance
Nomination and Succession Committee
155 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 157 ----
During the year, the Principles for the Strategic Composition of the 
Board were reviewed and updated. The NOMCO also focused on the 
future needs for the Board's composition, including size and tenure, 
skills and experience, and the DE&I requirements of the UK Listing 
Rules, FTSE Women Leaders and the Parker Review. The current size of 
the Board was considered to be appropriate, also taking account of 
Committee memberships. Greater flexibility around Non-Executive 
tenure was also discussed. Although Shell does not publish its Principles 
for the Strategic Composition of the Board, it has published its updated 
Board and Senior Management Diversity Policy on the Company's 
website. This Policy highlights that Shell aims for a gender balance on 
the Board, with at least one senior Board position (Chair, CEO or CFO) 
held by a woman. In addition, Shell's target is to maintain the 
representation of both men and women at, or above, a minimum of 
40%. We believe that this allows Shell to be truly representative of all 
genders and gender identities and provides flexibility during periods of 
change. Further, Shell aims to maintain or exceed having at least one 
Board member from an ethnic minority background.
See "Our People" on page 128.
For Senior Management succession, the selection principles include 
process-specific elements, such as a clear and proactive approach to 
identifying and developing succession candidates. The principles also 
outline the long-term structured nature of the succession planning 
process. There is also strong focus on ensuring that the principles reflect 
the leadership qualities required for future business success and that 
they advance the progress of diversity in all its forms.
Senior Management principles feature in the NOMCO's review of the 
succession plans which occurs in every Committee meeting. Using the 
principles, the NOMCO implements any changes through a well-
defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The 
NOMCO agrees on candidate profiles and meets prospective 
candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. 
It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors 
have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. 
Consequently, some of the leaders whom the NOMCO and Board 
engaged with extensively in the past became members of the Board 
(Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman) or the Executive Committee 
(Philippa Bounds and Robin Mooldijk, and with Rachel Solway's 
appointment effective January 1, 2024, announced during the year).
During 2023, the NOMCO's annual in-depth look at the status and 
succession plans for Senior Management within Shell, along with the 
review of the talent pipeline in line with the business, was undertaken 
by the full Board. The Board reflected on the simplification of the senior 
leadership structure with clear accountabilities achieved in 2023 with a 
view to the further evolvement of the composition of the total workforce 
and of the organisation's culture as an enabler for performance.
 Senior Succession and Resourcing Review
Diversity of leadership
The NOMCO recognises that continuing to improve all types of 
diversity at each level of the Shell Group is crucial. Shell aims to be an 
inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected and 
has a strong sense of belonging. The NOMCO's review of diversity 
objectives and strategies for the Shell Group as a whole also monitors 
the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives. 
In February 2021, Shell published its aspirations for diversity, equity 
and inclusion (DE&I) under the powering lives goal, with a focus on four 
areas of gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion. 
When looking at our progress against our ambitions, women 
representation has steadily improved in recent years, with a two 
percentage point increase over the last year. Among experienced 
recruitment in 2023, Shell companies recruited 38% women, and 
among graduates 40%. Women representation in the top 1,200 roles 
("Senior Leadership" positions) has strengthened by 2% during 2023 to 
32%, and we continue to progress towards our aim of achieving 35% 
women senior leadership representation by 2025. 
"Senior Leadership" is a Shell-specific measure and different from 
that which we are required to report under the Code, being female 
representation in Senior Management and their direct reports, 
where the percentage is 27%.

Nationality diversity, such as Asian and American talent, continues to 
be managed in accordance with the business outlook and we have a 
strong focus on progressing race and ethnic minority representation, 
beginning in the UK and the USA and followed by the Netherlands. 
The representation of people of colour among Shell's senior leaders in 
the USA has been actively tracked for many years. It stood at 26.9% 
at the end of 2023, compared with 17.3% in 2016. In the UK, race and 
ethnic minority representation among senior leaders was 18.3% [A].
[A] UK specific: the ethnicity declaration is voluntary, our ethnicity declaration rate is not 100% 
and all calculations are based on declaration rate of 76.6%. The 23.4% of our workforce 
who have not provided data or chosen not to declare their ethnicity were not included in 
our calculations.
In line with the recommendations from the 2023 Parker Review, Shell 
has reviewed its ambitions for ethnic minority representation at the 
senior management level and aims for 15% senior management 
positions [B] to be occupied by ethnic minority executives by 
December 2027.
[B] The 2023 Parker review defines Senior Management as the Executive Committee and the 
senior managers who report directly to them.
Although the NOMCO monitors Shell's organisational DE&I strategies 
and initiatives, it also holds itself accountable for the Board's own 
diversity and inclusion. Back in 2020, the Board's diverse composition 
met the Hampton Alexander requirements (now FTSE Women Leaders) 
and, in 2023, it met the Parker Reviews' objectives by reflecting 42% 
women representation with one ethnic minority director. Shell's Board 
diversity is aligned with the targets set by UK Listing Rules. The position 
of CFO is held by a woman and three Directors are from an ethnic 
minority group.
 
More information on DE&I in Shell is provided in the "Powering lives" section on page 128.
The People Strategy and diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity continued to be a key area of focus during the year and is 
encompassed in the powering lives pillar of our Powering Progress 
strategy. The Board has developed and approved a new board DE&I 
policy further to a recommendation by the NOMCO. The policy is 
aligned to the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and includes our targets for Board diversity, as well as complementing 
Shell's wider diversity policies and embracing Shell's values, code of 
conduct and sustainability goals. Currently, this policy is not applied 
to the individual Committees, although we strive to apply diverse 
representation across the Committees. DE&I across Committee 
membership remains an ongoing consideration. A copy of the 
DE&I policy is available on our website, shell.com/investors/
environmental-social-and-governance/board-of-directors.
In relation to Board director appointments and diversity, the NOMCO 
oversees the development of a diverse pipeline for succession to 
the Board and monitors that all board appointments are subject 
to a formal, rigorous, and transparent procedure and that such 
appointments are based on merit and objective criteria taking into 
account (among other things) factors such as diversity of gender, 
age, educational and professional background, social, ethnic and 
geographical background and cognitive and personal strengths. 
To this end, the NOMCO is responsible for engaging an independent 
executive search consultant, who assists in preparing shortlists 
of candidates, coordinating interviews and seeking references. 
In accordance with the Board DE&I policy, the NOMCO only 
engages with external search firms who are able to align with 
Shell's approach to DE&I in identifying suitable individuals from 
diverse pools of candidates.
Under the DE&I policy, the Board commits to: 
￮ Ensuring an inclusive environment: Through inclusive behaviours and 
practices, we aim to create a board environment where every Board 
member feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute fully;
￮ Ensuring support for External Best Practices: The Board endorses and 
supports external best practices, such as the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review, Parker Review, and others, to maintain and enhance 
diversity within the Board;
￮ Ensuring that Board appointments are managed with rigour and 
transparency: Candidates are evaluated based on merit, skills, 
experience, qualifications, performance, and business 
considerations, with due regard for diversity factors;
￮ Ensuring regular Board composition reviews: The Board regularly 
assesses the composition of the Board, including age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, educational, social, geographical, and professional 
backgrounds, skills, knowledge, and experience, making 
recommendations for necessary adjustments.
Shell has an inclusive Board environment, comprising individuals that 
are suitably qualified. They have the required skills, industry expertise, 
breadth of perspective and high-quality decision-making capabilities 
to support the strategy and overall direction of Shell. 
 
See "The Board of Shell plc" on pages 139-145 for details about the skills and backgrounds 
of individual members. 
From a gender perspective, the Board is comprised of five female 
directors and seven male directors, representing 42% female 
representation (2022: 55%, 2021: 50%). Two of the four main 
Board committees are chaired by a female director.
While the Board aspires to achieve gender parity, progress against 
diversity targets is sensitive to the size of the Board. In respect of other 
forms of diversity, three members of the Board self-identify as being 
from an ethnic minority background. In accordance with the Board's 
DE&I policy, the Board firmly believes that diversity fosters a broader 
range of perspectives, resulting in improved Board effectiveness, 
decision-making, and outcomes.

In addition to its considerations regarding succession (some 
of which were in the early part of 2023), the NOMCO made 
recommendations on corporate governance guidelines, monitored 
compliance with corporate governance requirements and made 
recommendations on corporate-governance-related disclosures.

Executive Committee succession
During the year, robust and effective succession planning supported the appointment of a number of new members to the Executive 
Committee. Some of the NOMCO activities in supporting these appointments are outlined below.
The NOMCO undertakes comprehensive engagement to understand who the candidates are for senior roles, what personally 
drives them and how they will ensure Shell achieves its strategic ambitions. 
Succession for senior roles is planned well in advance and reviewed regularly. Succession planning is a crucial, ongoing 
consideration and not just an area of focus when an Executive Committee (EC) member is nearing the end of their tenure. The Board 
oversees Shell's succession planning process in which selection is the final step of a rigorous, sophisticated and well-planned process.
For Executive Director and EC appointments, the NOMCO has set a structured process:
￮ Before any potential decision on resourcing, it explicitly describes the requirements of the role and the candidate profile.
￮ By working in a planned, consistent manner, last-minute surprises are avoided and well-considered decisions are made in line with 
evolving business requirements.
￮ It also plans for the unexpected and maintains a list of candidates capable of stepping into senior roles to provide cover if necessary.
The NOMCO spends time getting to know the candidates to ensure that the pipeline is robust, diverse and adaptive. The NOMCO 
ensures it has visibility of today's and tomorrow's leaders. Over the last few years, the NOMCO has met many leaders and had extensive 
engagements with each of them. Some of these leaders now sit on the EC, others were appointed to the Board (Wael Sawan and Sinead 
Gorman).
The NOMCO engages across the Executive talent pipeline to ensure it interacts with and becomes familiar with talent at different 
levels of the organisation; for example, on a regular basis informal engagements are held with employees from a range of businesses, 
functions and backgrounds prior to a Board meeting. Not only does this engagement support senior succession, it also provides a helpful 
element of the NOMCO's workforce engagement.
The Board is proud that candidates for the most senior leadership roles have primarily come from within the business, proving that the 
leadership development and succession process remains effective.

Purpose
The Sustainability Committee [A] ("SUSCO") assists the Board of 
Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities by reviewing the progress of 
Shell with respect to sustainability and reviewing the non-financial 
elements of Shell's Powering Progress strategy.
[A] The Sustainability Committee was previously the Safety, Environment and Sustainability 
Committee.
Overview
The SUSCO meets regularly to review and discuss a wide range of 
topics, which include progress on Shell's Powering Progress strategic 
themes of net zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives.
The SUSCO also reviews selected sustainability topics and matters 
of public concern, such as biodiversity and plastic waste. 
As directed by the Board, the SUSCO provides input to Shell's annual 
reporting and disclosures on energy transition and sustainability. 
Governance
Sustainability Committee
160 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 162 ----
The SUSCO also reviews and considers external stakeholder 
perspectives on sustainability issues of relevance to the 
Group's businesses. 
In line with the strategic importance of the SUSCO's agenda, 
the Chair of the Board and the CFO attend committee meetings. 
Shell's CEO and the EC hold overall accountability for sustainability 
within Shell. In February 2023, Shell announced the new role of 
Executive Vice President of Carbon and Sustainability, reporting 
to the CFO.
Activities
During 2023, the SUSCO refocused its agenda on the areas of 
greatest strategic importance to Shell, in line with its updated terms 
of reference. This allowed the SUSCO to more effectively oversee 
Shell's progress with respect to sustainability.
The SUSCO reviewed the progress made against the non-financial 
elements of Shell’s Powering Progress strategy, including progress 
against the ambitions and targets under the goals of achieving
net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives.
The sustainability topics and matters of public concern discussed 
in particular depth by the committee included biodiversity, plastic 
waste and methane emissions.
The SUSCO provided input to Shell's annual reporting and disclosures 
on energy transition and sustainability. The SUSCO Chair held 
meetings during the year with senior leaders to discuss specific topics.
 
See our website shell.com for details on SUSCO and how Shell manages sustainability.
Site visits
The SUSCO visited the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland in 
Germany, in November 2023. The visit included a review of energy 
transition projects that are part of the site's transformation, a review 
of operational safety and process safety performance, a tour of the 
facility, meetings with site staff, and an engagement with the Director 
General at the Ministry for Economic Affairs, Innovation, Digitalization 
and Energy of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Two members of the SUSCO visited the Olympus offshore platform in 
the Gulf of Mexico in April 2023. The visit included a review of safety 
performance, production operations, the offshore business and Shell's 
approach to sustainability.

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present our Audit and Risk Committee (the "ARC") 
Report for 2023. 
I was delighted to welcome new ARC members, Cyrus Taraporevala, 
Sir Charles Roxburgh and Catherine Hughes. They joined the ARC 
on March 2, 2023, March 13, 2023 and May 23, 2023 respectively 
and bring valuable insight and experience. I would also like to thank 
Martina Hund-Mejean for her contribution as a committee member 
since May, 2020. 
The ARC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in 
areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal controls, as well as the consideration 
of ethics and compliance matters. We are responsible for assessing 
the quality of the audit performed by, and the independence 
and objectivity of, the external auditor. The ARC also makes a 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment or reappointment 
of the external auditor. In addition, we oversee the work and quality 
of the internal audit function. During the year, the ARC's core duties 
remained largely unchanged and our usual cadence of activities 
remained in place. However, in recognition of the ARC's increased 
focus on risk management, we refreshed our Terms of Reference, 
formalising our role in assisting the Board in this area and revised our 
committee name to include "Risk". Detail on our oversight activities 
in relation to risk management can be found on page 166.
Our work programme over the course of a year focuses on a variety of 
matters that involve a high degree of judgement and/or are significant 
to Shell's consolidated financial statements. We review with 
management the sources of estimation uncertainty and other key 
assumptions against the backdrop of economic and market uncertainty 
and volatility, climate risk and the energy transition and evolving 
stakeholder expectations. In addition, we consider the robustness 
of the risk and internal control framework, results of internal control 
testing performed throughout the year, and remediation activities. 
Ann Godbehere
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
Topics addressed in 2023 included: updates on Shell's announced 
withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities; deferred taxes and tax 
exposures; the impact on tax balances and disclosures as a result of 
windfall and minimum taxes around the world; significant portfolio 
developments; litigation; impairment trigger assessments; impairment 
charges and reversals; accounting for complex contracts; dividend 
distribution capacity; and mark-to-market derivatives accounting, 
including the impact of volatile gas and power markets. 
We received briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor on the 
effectiveness of Shell's risk management and internal control system 
and on the outcomes of significant audits and notable control matters. 
The impacts of climate change and the energy transition continue 
to touch on many aspects of the ARC's work, including the financial 
statement impacts as well as data assurance challenges of meeting 
expanded climate-related disclosures. In order to obtain feedback 
to continuously improve carbon-related disclosures, management 
engaged with Sarasin & Partners and Carbon Tracker during 2023.
The ARC, recognising the evolving nature of climate change risks and 
responses, concluded that climate change has been appropriately 
considered by management in key judgements and estimates and 
agreed with the disclosure made by management.
“The primary role of the ARC is to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities in areas such as the integrity 
of financial reporting, the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal controls, 
as well as the consideration of ethics 
and compliance matters.“

During 2023, the ARC was briefed on the implementation of the 
Shell Performance Framework which replaced the former Shell Control 
Framework with effect from July 1, 2023. Other focus topics for 2023 
included Trading and Supply; regulatory developments, for example 
audit reform and corporate governance proposals and new 
sustainability reporting regulations; and new business ventures 
and controls.
As part of its oversight of compliance with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance 
risks, the ARC discussed with the Group Chief Privacy Officer activities 
undertaken in the ethics and compliance programme related to 
compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, and steps 
taken to manage those risks. 
In 2023, the ARC conducted a site visit to the USA where it visited 
a number of operations and more recently, some members of the 
ARC visited Oman and Qatar. These site visits deepen the ARC's 
understanding of risks and opportunities, as well as its understanding of 
how the Company's Powering Progress strategy is being implemented.
The external audit tender process also commenced in 2023 and will 
continue in 2024 as set out later in this report. 
On a final note, the ARC recognises the strong commitment and 
dedication of the financial reporting team and would like to thank 
them for all their efforts during 2023.

All ARC members are financially literate, independent Non-executive 
Directors. In respect of the year ended December 31, 2023, for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Ann Godbehere 
qualifies as: a person with "recent and relevant financial experience" 
and competence in accounting, and, for the purposes of US securities 
laws, an "audit committee financial expert".
The experience of the ARC members outlined on pages 139-145 
demonstrates that the ARC as a whole has competence relevant to 
the sector in which Shell operates, and the necessary commercial, 
regulatory, financial and audit expertise required to fulfil its 
responsibilities. The ARC members have gained further knowledge 
and experience of the sector as a result of their Board membership 
and through various in-person and virtual site visits since their 
respective appointments. 
The ARC invites the CFO, the Legal Director, the Chief Internal Auditor, 
the Executive Vice President (EVP) Controller, the Vice President Group 
Appraisal and Reporting and Deputy Controller and the external 
auditor to attend each meeting. The CEO, the Chair of the Board 
and the Company Secretary may also attend ARC meetings. Other 
members of management attend when requested on specific topics or 
to provide input on more detailed technical matters that may arise. The 
ARC regularly holds private sessions separately with the Chief Internal 
Auditor and the external auditor without members of management, 
except for the Legal Director, being present. Outside of the formal 
ARC meetings, the Chair of the ARC meets regularly with each of the 
following: the CFO, EVP Tax, EVP Controller, the Chief Internal Auditor, 
the external auditor, and the Chief Information Officer.
Committee remit
The roles and responsibilities of the ARC, as set out in its Terms of 
Reference, are reviewed annually (last reviewed in July 2023 and 
a copy of which can be found at shell.com) taking into account 
relevant regulatory changes and recommended best practice. 
The key responsibilities of the ARC include, but are not limited to:
Risk Management and Internal Control
￮ assisting the Board in reviewing the emerging, principal, and other 
significant risks facing the Group;
￮ monitoring the effectiveness of the system of risk management 
and internal control;
Financial Reporting
￮ reviewing the integrity of the financial statements, including annual 
reports, half-year reports, and quarterly financial statements; 
￮ reviewing the potential impacts on the consolidated financial 
statements of the implementation of the Company's strategy, 
climate change and the energy transition;
￮ advising the Board whether, in the ARC's view, the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's 
position and performance, business model and strategy;
￮ reviewing and discussing with management the appropriateness 
of judgements involving the application of accounting principles 
and disclosure rules; 
Compliance and Governance
￮ reviewing the functioning of the Shell Global Helpline and reports 
arising from its operation; 
￮ overseeing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance risks; 
Internal Audit
￮ monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence 
of the internal audit function; 
￮ approving the internal audit function's charter and the annual 
internal audit plan to ensure alignment with the key risks of 
the business;
￮ reviewing any significant matters arising from internal audits with 
the Chief Internal Auditor, and the Company's management and 
assessing management's response to internal audit findings and 
control weaknesses as appropriate, including potential 
improvements and agreed actions;
￮ assessing internal audit's performance and effectiveness each year; 
External Audit
￮ reviewing and monitoring the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor; 
￮ considering the annual external audit plan and approving related 
remuneration, including fees for audit and non-audit services; 
￮ assessing the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor 
and the audit process, including an assessment of the quality of the 
audit; and 
￮ recommending to the Board for it to put to the Company's 
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting ("AGM") 
a resolution to appoint, reappoint, or remove the external auditor.
These responsibilities form the basis of the ARC's annual work plan, 
which is adjusted as necessary throughout the year. In addition, the 
ARC annually identifies certain business and function areas to focus on 
during that year. The focus areas generally encompass aspects of risk 
management and internal control, financial reporting and compliance. 
The ARC is authorised to seek any information it requires from 
management and external parties and to investigate issues or 
concerns as it deems appropriate. The ARC may also obtain 
independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
No such independent advice was requested in 2023. 
The ARC keeps the Board informed of its activities and 
recommendations, and the Chair of the ARC provides an update to the 
Board after every ARC meeting. The ARC discusses with the Board if it 
is not satisfied with or believes that action or improvement is required 
concerning any aspect of financial reporting, risk management and 
internal control, compliance or audit-related activities.

Focus areas for 2023
of ARC time and activities
The ARC met with senior leaders from various business and function 
areas to discuss the adequacy, design and operational effectiveness 
of risk management and controls related to the critical activities carried 
out by their respective business or function. The discussions included 
information on any enhancements to strengthen controls and how 
areas identified for improvement had been addressed; the monitoring 
of activities around key risks; and the steps being taken to identify 
new or emerging areas of risk. 
In addition to the significant accounting and reporting considerations 
discussed on pages 168-169 the business and function areas reviewed 
by the ARC in 2023 included the following:
￮ Trading and Supply – the ARC was provided with updates on 
Trading and Supply activities, particularly in the light of market 
volatility. Topics included transformation programmes, and 
management of credit and market risk. The ARC also visited the 
trading floor in Houston where ARC members received various 
briefings, including in relation to the trading and IT platforms used 
by the Shell Energy Americas Gas & Power Trading team. 
￮ Shell Performance Framework – the ARC reviewed the introduction 
of the Shell Performance Framework which replaced the existing 
Shell Control Framework with effect from July 1, 2023. The new 
framework retains the core strengths of the previous Shell Control 
Framework, while placing greater focus on achieving the right 
commercial outcomes by emphasising the value of using a "whole 
systems" approach to business activities including the role that 
performance culture plays in achieving Shell's objectives. The ARC 
discussed with management how the framework is being applied 
in practice.
￮ Regulatory developments – the ARC was regularly updated with 
respect to regulatory developments and their potential implications 
for Shell, including in relation to the draft Audit Regulation (which 
was subsequently withdrawn) and the Corporate Governance Code 
consultation. The ARC was briefed in relation to UK, US and EU 
sustainability reporting developments, including the CSRD, and their 
implications for Shell, in particular potential assurance requirements.
￮ New business ventures and controls – the ARC met with the 
management of Sprng Energy (which Shell acquired in August 2022) 
and discussed the integration process.
Site visits
During the year, the ARC conducted a site visit to the USA where 
ARC members visited a number of operations including Shell Polymers 
Monaca, the Shell Norco facility, the Shell-operated Vito floating 
production facility in the Gulf of Mexico (virtual visit from New 
Orleans) and the Houston trading floor. Recently, some members 
of the ARC also visited Oman and Qatar.
Site visits are an important part of the ARC's annual work plan, as they 
provide the opportunity for the ARC to gain a deeper understanding of 
the various businesses and functions at each location, the local external 
and risk environment within which those activities take place and how 
they contribute to Shell achieving its strategic ambitions. In addition to 
in-depth examinations of specific business areas, site visits enable the 
ARC members to interact with a diverse group of employees and learn 
about their experiences, challenges they face and their opportunities 
for career development. The ARC is also briefed on the impact of the 
energy transition at a local level, how risks associated with climate 
change are managed, and the results of the Shell People Survey.

Risk Management
and Internal Control
of ARC time and activities
The ARC assists the Board in reviewing the emerging, principal, and 
other significant risks facing the Group and in fulfilling its responsibilities 
in relation to risk management and internal control. In order to monitor 
the effectiveness of the procedures for internal control over financial 
reporting, compliance and operational matters, the ARC reviews 
reports on risks, controls and assurance, including the annual 
assessment of the system of risk management and internal control. 
The ARC also reviews the Company's evaluation of the internal control 
over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX 404). The ARC updated the Board on compliance 
with internal controls across the Shell Group and on any major 
matters for which action or improvement was recommended.

Throughout the year, the ARC and management discuss Shell's 
overall approach to risk management and internal control, including 
compliance, tax, and information risk management matters and the 
adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures. The ARC receives 
regular reports from the EVP Controller on the status of actions to 
address control weaknesses identified via business control incidents 
and the trends in other measures used to monitor the robustness of 
the risk management framework and internal control systems.
 
The ARC is also briefed on litigation and other matters (see Note 31 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on pages 286-288 and "Governance framework" on page 153).
The ARC regularly reviews the status of management's SOX 404 
testing of controls and remediation actions to address any identified 
weaknesses. For 2023, these reviews included consideration of how 
the volatile external environment affected the controls and assurance 
landscape, including the financial reporting process. The ARC and 
management discussed the steps taken to maintain an effective 
control environment and to demonstrate "management in control" 
during the year. 
It is important that the ARC monitors and learns about evolving 
external developments in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the ARC 
is regularly briefed on developments in the legal, regulatory and 
financial reporting landscape that could affect the Company. 
In 2023, the ARC dedicated time to the following topics:
￮ Tax risks – In addition to the regular review of Shell's tax provisions, 
management also briefed the ARC regarding developments in the 
external tax landscape, including windfall and minimum taxes and 
how different jurisdictions are seeking to incentivise investment when 
entering new markets and businesses. Management outlined for the 
ARC the steps being taken to manage tax risks and exposures 
arising from differing viewpoints on complex tax laws.
￮ Information risk management, including cyber security – The ARC 
was briefed in relation to Shell's Information and Risk management 
framework, particularly in the light of the deterioration of the 
external threat environment and evolving global regulatory 
landscape (including SEC cybersecurity disclosure rules). 
￮ Oil and gas reserves control framework – The ARC annually reviews 
the framework that supports Shell's internal reporting and external 
disclosures of oil and gas reserves. The ARC also reviews the 
processes and controls that prevent and/or mitigate the risks of
non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. This annual 
review of Shell's oil and gas reserves control framework supports 
the ARC's review of Shell's reported proved oil and gas reserves 
discussed later in this report.
In addition to the above, the ARC also had quarterly discussions with 
the Chief Internal Auditor regarding the Company's risk management 
and internal control system, significant matters arising from the internal 
audit assurance programme and management's response to internal 
audit findings and control weaknesses, including potential 
improvements and agreed actions.
The ARC similarly holds discussions with EY, the external auditor, on a 
quarterly basis regarding how risks to audit quality are addressed, key 
accounting and audit judgements, results from audit procedures and 
management's response to any significant audit findings and any 
material communications between EY and management.

Shell's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 
2022 was selected by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for review 
[A] in accordance with Part 2 of the FRC's Corporate Reporting Review 
Operating Procedures. The FRC raised some queries in relation to 
determination of discount rates used in impairment testing and 
provided some observations to take into account when considering 
whether any improvements can be made to future financial reporting. 
Following correspondence, the review was closed on January 19, 
2024 and some disclosure enhancements have been made to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2023. The ARC reviewed Shell's correspondence with the FRC and 
discussed with management the disclosures incorporated in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in response to the FRC review
[A] The FRC noted that their review is based solely on the annual report and accounts and 
does not benefit from detailed knowledge of Shell's business or an understanding of the 
underlying transactions entered into, but that it is, however, conducted by staff of the 
FRC who have an understanding of the relevant legal and accounting framework. The FRC 
correspondence provides no assurance that Shell's annual report and accounts for the year 
ended December 31, 2022 are correct in all material respects; the FRC's role is not to 
verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.
The ARC reviewed the Company's 2023 quarterly unaudited interim 
financial statements, half-year report, Annual Report and Form 20-F 
with management and the external auditor. 
Shell uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to provide greater 
insights into its financial and operating results. The ARC regularly 
considers the APMs used in Shell's reporting, the reconciliations to IFRS 
financial statements and explanations for changes from the previous 
quarter and year. The ARC reviews the overall presentation of APMs 
with management to ensure they are not given undue prominence. 
The ARC discusses adjusting items with management including any 
changes to methodology. 
The APMs disclosed by Shell are subject to the same internal control 
process as applied for other financial reporting. 
The Committee discussed the audited financial statements with 
management and the external auditor. The Committee advised the 
Board that in its view the 2023 Form 20-F including the financial 
statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, taken as a whole, 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's 
position and performance, business model and strategy. The 
Committee also advised the Board that in its view, the inclusion of the 
audited financial statements in the 2023 Form 20-F is appropriate. To 
reach this conclusion, the Committee critically assessed drafts of the 
2023 Form 20-F including the financial statements and reviewed with 
management the process for ensuring compliance with applicable 
requirements. This process included: verifying that the contents of the 
2023 Form 20-F are consistent with the information shared with the 
Board during the year to support their assessment of Shell's position 
and performance; ensuring that consistent materiality thresholds are 
applied for favourable and unfavourable items; considering comments 
from the external auditor; and receiving assurance from the Executive 
Committee (EC). The Committee also reviewed and considered the 
Directors' half-year and full-year statements with respect to the going 
concern basis of accounting. The Committee and the external auditor 
also discussed matters regarding the audit and the quality of the 
accounting judgements employed by management.

Significant accounting and reporting considerations
The ARC assessed the following significant accounting and reporting areas, including those related to Shell's 2023 Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The ARC was satisfied with how each of the areas below was addressed. As part of this assessment, the ARC received reports, 
requested and received clarifications from management, and sought assurance and received input from the internal and external auditors. 
Climate change and energy transition
Risks related to climate change and the energy 
transition are continually monitored to ensure impacts 
are reflected within Shell's financial statements.
The external landscape related to non-financial 
disclosures continues to evolve. In the absence of one 
global standard for climate-related reporting there 
are growing demands from various regulatory and 
voluntary bodies all with their own expectations 
for disclosures.
The ARC discussed with management key regulatory requirements including (but not limited to) the FRC, 
ISSB, SEC and EU disclosure requirements and their implications for Shell's external disclosures. The ARC 
also received an update on the outcome of management's engagement with Sarasin & Partners and 
Carbon Tracker.
The ARC reviewed Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" summarising the key climate risk 
impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the impairment sensitivity disclosures using 
price outlooks based on different climate change scenarios, including external scenarios.
See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 231-243.
The ARC was briefed on the non-financial reporting external landscape developments and regulatory 
requirements. In this connection, the ARC considered the potential implications required for Shell's external 
disclosures going forward. The ARC reviewed the TCFD disclosure in the "Our journey to net zero" section, 
including covering aspects of ETS24, and other non-financial disclosures as part of the Annual Report review 
and was briefed on the EU Taxonomy voluntary disclosures included as supplementary information to the 
Annual Report.
Updates regarding climate change and energy transition have been included in the risk factors section on 
page 18.
Impairment and impairment reversals
The carrying amount of an asset should be tested 
for impairment or impairment reversal whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the recoverable amount for that asset may have 
changed, for example if there is a change in the 
outlook for commodity prices or refining margin 
assumptions, or in the event of revisions to future 
activity plans and developments. On classification 
as held for sale, the carrying amounts of property, 
plant and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets 
must also be reviewed.
The ARC reviewed the impairment assessments that were performed each quarter, and the methodology 
applied in conducting impairment assessments.
The ARC considered increases in global risk-free interest rates, alongside other input assumptions, in 
assessing market expectations of the expected rate of return on various assets. As a result, weighted 
average cost of capital ("WACC") assumptions have been updated with effect from June 2023, reflecting 
management's conclusion that a structural increase in expected rates of return could be observed. This 
resulted in an increase in the discount rate applied for impairment testing purposes and a trigger for 
impairment assessment. The ARC reviewed the outcome of this assessment and the resulting impairment 
which has been recognised in the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The ARC also reviewed 
the outcomes of periodic reassessments of the WACC during the remainder of the year, including 
management's conclusion on the reasonability of the discount rate applied as at December 31, 2023. 
The ARC considered the updated oil and gas price outlooks against market developments and benchmarks. 
The 2023 commodity price outlook was reassessed to determine whether revised price premises would 
result in a trigger for impairment or impairment reversal. Based on the analysis performed, no triggers 
were identified.
The ARC also reviewed other circumstances that may indicate that the recoverable amount of assets have 
changed, such as those related to revision of future plans and developments, exploration and evaluation 
assets, held-for-sale classification for asset disposals and margin assumptions. The ARC also reviewed the 
outcomes of goodwill testing, including for new acquisitions. 
See Notes 2, 10, 11 and 12 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 221-231, 252, 253-254 
and 255-257.
Gas & Power markets and derivatives accounting
External events during the year, such as the Russia-
Ukraine war and uncertainties over Russian gas 
supplies, affected trading activities. The impacts on 
financial outcomes of Integrated Gas and Renewable 
and Energy Solutions included, for example, 
significant derivatives movements.
The ARC reviewed Trading and Supply activities and developments, including detailed analysis of the 
trading strategies employed, their impact on financial metrics, and the associated accounting treatment 
applied.
The ARC reviewed the impacts of volatile gas and power markets including the impact on mark-to-
market valuation of derivatives, income for the period and adjusted earnings, as well as the resulting 
cash flow movements.
The ARC received updates on the enhancement of reporting processes within Trading and Supply, with 
a focus on the accuracy and efficacy of these processes.

Issue Committee activity and outcome
Taxation
The determination of tax assets and liabilities requires 
the application of judgement as to the ultimate 
outcome, which can change over time. In particular, 
uncertain tax treatments require management to assess 
the more-likely-than- not outcome, and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets requires management to make 
assumptions regarding future profitability. As a result, 
they are inherently uncertain.
The ARC considered the uncertain tax positions and discussed management's assumptions of future 
taxable profits. The ARC also evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and tax liabilities. The ARC recognises that assumptions regarding future taxable profits are inherently 
uncertain because they involve assessing factors such as the potential impacts of climate change and 
the energy transition. The ARC deemed the assessments of uncertain tax exposures and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities to be reasonable.
The ARC also reviewed the impact of IAS 12 amendments that required a change to the Group's deferred 
tax treatment of decommissioning and restoration (D&R) obligations.
See Notes 2 and 22 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 221-231 and 266-268.
Portfolio activities 
In implementing the Powering Progress strategy, several 
portfolio developments occurred in 2023. 
The ARC discussed the accounting implications of these developments and the recognition of: (i) 
decommissioning and restoration provisions; (ii) deferred tax balances; (iii) impairment; and (iv) assets 
held for sale. The ARC also considered complex accounting treatments arising from acquisitions and 
divestments, including the acquisition of Nature Energy Biogas. 
See Notes 2 and 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 221-231 and 275-276.
Provisions
Provisions, including decommissioning and restoration 
provisions, are one of the main components of the 
balance sheet liabilities. The quantification of these 
provisions requires judgements on input parameters 
which include, but are not limited to, discount rates and 
estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs.
The ARC reviewed provisions, including onerous contracts and litigation. The ARC also reviewed 
the input parameter assumptions and judgements used in arriving at the decommissioning and 
restoration provisions. 
The discount rate is reviewed regularly and the ARC considered the change in discount rate to be applied 
prospectively from the fourth quarter 2023, following an observable increase in US Treasury yields. The 
impact of the change in discount rate on non-current decommissioning and other provisions was disclosed 
in the fourth quarter 2023 quarterly results announcement.
The ARC has continued to receive updates on the withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities 
throughout 2023 including implications for the financial statements.
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are an important component 
of both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. 
The quantification of these assets and liabilities requires 
judgements on input parameters which include, but are 
not limited to, actuarial assumptions and discount rates.
The ARC reviewed the management of risks in relation to retirement benefits in 2023, including financial, 
operational, and regulatory developments. The ARC reviewed the key assumptions (including discount 
rates and inflation) and sensitivities as part of the Annual Report review and the enhanced disclosures 
made in this Report.
See Note 23 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 268-274.
Other matters
The ARC reviewed: the year-end reported proved oil and gas reserves, including management judgements and adjustments made to reflect 
changes in geological, technical, contractual and economic information (including yearly average price assumptions) and the effectiveness of 
financial controls. An explanation of the Group's accounting policies is provided on pages 221-231.

trends and developments were affecting conduct risk at Shell. The Chief 
Ethics and Compliance Officer summarised the specific emerging ethics 
and compliance risks, with a particular focus on trade compliance and 
data privacy, and management's actions to manage and mitigate 
them. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer briefed the ARC 
on communications to staff from both senior leaders and mid-level 
management reinforcing the importance of adherence to and affirming 
Shell's commitment to the Ethics and Compliance framework and 
Code of Conduct throughout the year.
As part of the annual assessment of the system of risk management 
and internal control, the ARC discussed with the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer their annual report on compliance matters. The 
report included an overview of the effectiveness of the Shell ethics and 
compliance programme in managing ethics and compliance risk in 
Shell's business activities, regulatory developments and compliance 
activities. The ARC also reviewed investigations of cases involving 
ethics and compliance concerns. The ARC discussed management's 
findings in such cases to satisfy itself that a rigorous process had been 
followed, with appropriate disciplinary action being taken where 
necessary, and that management had embedded learnings into 
Shell's systems and controls. 
Whistleblowing investigations
The ARC is responsible for establishing and monitoring the 
implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation 
and follow-up actions of complaints received, including those from the 
Shell Global Helpline. The ARC reviewed whistleblowing reports and 
internal audit reports and considered management's responses to the 
findings in these reports. In 2023, 2,134 allegations and inquiries were 
made through the Shell Global Helpline (2022: 1,790), of which 
approximately 41% were submitted anonymously (2022: 41%). In 
2023, a total of 470 investigations were closed (2022: 412), of which 
54% were found to have some level of substantiation (2022: 44%) and 
were primarily in the areas involving harassment, conflicts of interest 
and protection of assets.
Regulatory developments
The ARC was briefed on regulatory developments in areas including:
(i) sustainability and climate-related disclosures (in particular 
management's responses to proposals from the International 
Sustainability Standards Board and FRC/EU disclosure requirements); 
(ii) the Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard 
and the proposed new Audit Regulation (which was subsequently 
withdrawn); (iii) accounting and reporting developments; (iv) 
environmental liabilities; and (v) treasury activities. In May 2023, 
the FRC launched a consultation in relation to the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and subsequently issued a revised version in 
January 2024. The ARC and management discussed the consultation 
proposals, including potential implications for the Company, the Board 
and the ARC. The ARC reviewed management's proposed response to 
the consultation and supported the response.
ARC annual evaluation 
The ARC undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and 
effectiveness. This year the ARC's performance evaluation was 
facilitated by the Company Secretary. Each ARC member responded to 
a confidential anonymised questionnaire about the ARC's performance 
covering questions on: the management of the ARC in areas such as 
the annual cycle of work and the agenda for meetings; the quality of 
the information provided to the ARC; the effectiveness of the ARC's 
oversight in areas such as financial reporting, risk management policies 
and practices and internal controls, and the work of internal and 
external audit; rating the ARC's performance in reviewing and 
assessing significant accounting/reporting issues; and how to improve 
the ARC's performance. Progress against the ambitions identified 
during the 2022 evaluation is provided in the Board evaluation section 
on page 154. Three themes from the 2023 evaluation process were 
identified as areas of focus for 2024, including risk management 
and presentation; structure of internal audit updates and further 
enhancement of pre-read for ARC meetings. The ARC concluded that 
its performance in 2023 had been effective and that it had fulfilled 
its role in accordance with its Terms of Reference. 
In preparing its work plan for 2024, the ARC has included the 
following focus areas in addition to the standing items: information 
risk management, including cyber security; regulatory developments, 
mainly those in relation to climate change and the energy transition, 
including non-financial reporting requirements and preparation for 
reporting under the CSRD and ISSB disclosure requirements; Trading 
and Supply; Shell Performance Framework; and external audit tender.

Each quarter, the ARC discusses with the Chief Internal Auditor 
the Company's risk management and internal control system, any 
significant matters arising from the internal audit assurance programme 
and management's response to significant audit findings and notable 
control weaknesses, including planned improvements and agreed 
actions. The ARC also holds private sessions separately with the Chief 
Internal Auditor without members of management, except for the Legal 
Director, being present. The ARC's time for these activities is included in 
Risk Management and Internal Control described earlier in this report. 
Outside of the formal ARC meetings, the Chair of the ARC meets 
regularly with the Chief Internal Auditor.
Internal audit remit
The internal audit function is an independent assurance function 
which supports Shell's continuous efforts to improve its overall control 
framework. The internal audit function contributes to the maintenance 
of a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
design and effectiveness of Shell's risk management, and control and 
governance processes. The primary role of the internal audit function's 
assurance and investigation activities is to safeguard value by 
protecting Shell's assets, reputation and sustainability in relation 
to the organisation's defined goals and objectives. 
The ARC defines the responsibility and scope of the internal audit 
function and approves its annual plan. The Chief Internal Auditor 
reports functionally to the Chair of the ARC and administratively 
to the Chief Financial Officer. The Chair of the ARC approves, in 
consultation with the Chief Financial Officer, all decisions regarding 
the performance evaluation, appointment or removal of the Chief 
Internal Auditor. A new Chief Internal Auditor was appointed 
with effect from August 2023.
Annual internal audit plan and assessment of internal 
audit's effectiveness
The ARC considered and approved the internal audit function's annual 
audit plan, including focus areas for 2023 consisting of:
￮ talent and capability (professional audit development and technical 
capabilities); 
￮ quality (developing first-line staff competence and clarity on self-
verification and supervisory controls); 
￮ alignment (improved integration of risk management and alignment 
of assurance processes across Shell); and 
￮ engagement (mainly in the area of keeping staff and Shell 
stakeholders engaged and informed on effective risk management 
and internal control). 
The Chief Internal Auditor updated the ARC quarterly on the approved 
2023 internal audit plan and discussed whether the plan remained 
fit for purpose in addressing the most critical areas of risk. The ARC 
assessed the performance of the internal audit function as effective. 
The ARC also assessed the performance of the Chief Internal Auditor 
as effective.
The Chief Internal Auditor periodically assesses whether the purpose, 
authority and responsibilities of the internal audit function continue 
to enable it to accomplish its objectives. The results of this periodic 
assessment are communicated to the EC and the ARC. The Chief 
Internal Auditor also confirms to the ARC the continued validity of 
the charter of the internal audit function or puts forward proposals 
for updates to it. The Chief Internal Auditor maintains an internal 
quality assurance and improvement programme, including an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal audit 
function's activities and evaluations of conformance with the standards 
of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA). The Chief Internal 
Auditor discusses the results of this annual assessment with the EC and 
the ARC. At least every five years, the effectiveness and quality of the 
internal audit function are independently assessed externally, and the 
Chief Internal Auditor reviews the report with the EC and the ARC. 
An independent assessment of the internal audit was conducted at the 
end of 2022, following up on the previous review in 2018. The 2022 
assessment confirmed that the internal audit conformed with the CIIA 
standards and the 2020 Internal Audit code of practice and identified 
some opportunities for further improvement. The next external 
assessment is planned to take place in 2027.

Annual external audit plan and assessment of external 
audit's effectiveness
EY reviewed with the ARC its audit strategy, scope and plan for 
the 2023 audit, highlighting areas which would receive special 
consideration. In particular, the ARC and EY discussed how the 
audit would take into consideration risks associated with: 
￮ Trading and Supply deal complexity; 
￮ Revenue recognition fraud risk (unauthorised trading and 
management override);
￮ Climate change and the energy transition; 
￮ Oil and gas reserves;
￮ Impairment assessments; 
￮ Decommissioning and restoration obligations;
￮ Exploration assets;
￮ Goodwill recoverability;
￮ Pensions; and
￮ Taxation, specifically deferred tax assets and uncertain 
tax treatments. 
EY defines significant audit risks as those areas where there is a higher 
likelihood of a material error and which therefore require special audit 
attention. In EY's view, the significant audit risks are Trading and Supply 
deal complexity and the risk of unauthorised trading or 
management override.
The ARC considered the annual audit plan, which included assessing 
whether the planned materiality levels and proposed resources to 
execute the audit plan were consistent with the scope of the audit.
EY regularly updated the ARC on the status of its procedures and 
preliminary findings, providing an opportunity for the ARC to monitor the 
execution and results of the audit. The ARC and EY discussed how risks 
to audit quality were addressed, key accounting and audit judgements, 
material communications between EY and management and any issues 
arising from them. At least quarterly, the ARC met privately with EY 
representatives without management (except for the Legal Director) being 
present in order to encourage open and transparent feedback from 
both parties. In addition, the Chair of the ARC meets separately with 
the external auditor on a regular basis. 
As part of its oversight of the external auditor, the ARC annually 
assesses the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and 
the audit process. This includes assessing the quality of the audit, how 
the auditor handled key judgements, and the auditor's response to the 
ARC's questions. The assessment also involves the ARC evaluating the 
objectivity and independence of EY and the quality and effectiveness 
of the external audit process.
The ARC's evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor and the audit process includes the following key criteria:
￮ professionalism, competence, integrity and objectivity during the 
audit, including handling of areas involving judgement and 
estimates; 
￮ EY's quality assurance procedures and internal quality control 
procedures; 
￮ audit quality priorities and actions taken as part of maintaining 
a sustainable audit quality programme;
￮ constructive challenge of management and key judgements; 
￮ efficiency, covering aspects such as service level and innovation 
in the audit process, use of data analytical and digital audit tools, 
and opportunities for improvement; 
￮ quality of the audit team's leadership;
￮ the most recent EY Transparency Report; 
￮ thought leadership and actions, especially in the areas of climate 
change; and 
￮ compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and professional 
requirements.
In addition to reflecting on its own experiences, including interactions 
with the external auditor throughout the year, the ARC considered 
and discussed the results of management's internal survey relating 
to EY's performance over the financial year 2023, which reflected 
a broadly comparable performance to 2022 and the views and 
recommendations from management and the Chief Internal Auditor. 
The ARC also considered the FRC Audit Quality Review ("AQR") team's 
inspection of EY's audit of the financial statements for the year ended 
December 31, 2022.
As part of the current assessment of effectiveness, the ARC has taken into 
consideration the guidance issued by the FRC, including the guidance on 
oversight of the external audit set out in "Audit Committees and the External 
Auditor: Minimum Standard".
Taking into account the above, the ARC is satisfied that EY continued to 
provide a high-quality and effective audit in its eighth year as auditor and 
maintained its objectivity, integrity and impartiality. As required under UK 
and US auditing standards, the ARC received a letter on independence-
related matters from EY. EY also informed the ARC in writing of any 
significant relationships and matters that may reasonably be thought to 
affect its objectivity and independence. The ARC and EY discussed such 
relationships and matters and determined that they did not impair EY's 
objectivity, integrity and impartiality.

External Auditor
continued
During 2023, EY's audit of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements for the 
financial year ended December 31, 2022 was selected for inspection by 
the AQR team of the FRC. Following the AQR team's inspection of EY's 
audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, 
the FRC wrote to the Chair of the ARC setting out the scope of its 
inspection, its audit quality assessment, good practice, and other findings. 
The inspection report was shared with all ARC members and discussed at 
an ARC meeting in December 2023. The ARC noted the inspection did not 
raise any key findings and highlighted five audit areas of good practice. 
Audit Committees and the External Audit: 
Minimum Standard
In May 2023, the FRC published the Audit Committees and the 
External Audit: Minimum Standard. This Audit and Risk Committee 
Report describes how the ARC has complied, to the extent applicable, 
with the provisions of the Minimum Standard during the year (in 
particular the "External Auditor" section of this report).
Reappointment and external audit tender
The ARC is responsible for considering whether there should be a 
rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm in order 
to ensure continuing auditor quality and/or independence, including 
consideration of the advisability and potential impact of conducting 
a tender process for the appointment of a different independent 
public accounting firm. The ARC is also responsible for making 
a recommendation to the Board, for it to put to the Company's 
shareholders for approval in the General Meeting, on the 
appointment, reappointment, or removal of the external auditor.
At the AGM in May 2023, the shareholders approved a resolution to 
reappoint EY as external auditor until the conclusion of the next AGM. EY 
was first appointed at the AGM in May 2016 after a competitive tender 
process. The lead audit partner, Gary Donald, has been in post since the 
start of the 2021 audit. Under UK legal requirements, the Company may 
retain EY as its external auditor for 20 years. For the 2023 financial year, 
the Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender 
Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
In its oversight of the external audit, the ARC considered whether it would 
be appropriate to conduct an audit tender in respect of the 2024 audit.
The ARC reflected on: 
￮ its continued satisfaction with the quality and independence
of EY's audit; 
￮ any new external auditor would need a transition period to develop 
sufficient understanding of the business given Shell's size and complexity; 
￮ frequent changes of external auditor would be inefficient and could 
lead to increased risk and the loss of cumulative knowledge; 
￮ a change in auditor would be expected to have a significant impact 
on Shell, including on the Finance function; and 
￮ any change in auditor should be scheduled to limit operational 
disruption. 
The ARC also considered EY's leadership and activities in the area 
of climate change. 
After due consideration the ARC determined that it would not be 
appropriate to re-tender for the external audit at this time. The ARC has 
recommended to the Board that at the 2024 AGM the Board should 
propose that EY be reappointed as the external auditor of the Company for 
the year ending December 31, 2024. The ARC's recommendation is free 
from third-party influence and there are no contractual obligations that 
restrict the ARC's ability to make such a recommendation. 
The ARC acknowledges the UK legal requirements relating to mandatory 
audit rotation (maximum 20-year engagement) and audit tendering (with 
a requirement to undertake a formal process after ten years). As EY was 
appointed in 2016 after a competitive tender process, the Company 
is required to tender for the audit no later than the financial year 
commencing January 1, 2026. During 2023, the ARC considered the 
proposed approach to the Group audit tender and the tender process was 
commenced, with a view to reaching a conclusion before the end of 2024. 
The ARC believes that this timeline for the re-tender is in the best interests of 
shareholders in order to prepare for orderly transition in the event that a 
new audit firm is selected. In conducting the tender process, the ARC will 
consider insofar as practical the guidance on tendering set out in the FRC's 
"Audit Committees and the External Auditor: Minimum Standard".
Non-audit services
The ARC maintains an auditor independence policy (AIP) in respect 
of the provision of services by the external auditor. Under the AIP, 
the ARC will only approve services to be carried out by the external 
auditor or its affiliates where such services do not present a conflict 
of interest risk in fact or in appearance. The ARC regularly reviews 
this policy for necessary changes in response to changes in related 
standards and regulatory requirements. 
This policy is designed to safeguard auditor objectivity and 
independence. It addresses the provision of audit services, audit-related 
services and other non-audit services and stipulates which services 
require specific prior approval by the ARC. 
The policy also defines prohibited services in line with applicable rules 
and regulations. Our external auditors are not allowed to provide 
prohibited services due to independence concerns. For certain non-
prohibited services, because of the knowledge and experience of the 
external auditor and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it may be more 
efficient or prudent for the external auditor to provide such services.
The ARC reviews quarterly reports from management on the audit and 
non-audit services reported in accordance with the policy or for which 
specific prior approval from the ARC is being sought. Under the AIP, no 
prior approval by the ARC is required for any additional audit service 
contract not individually exceeding $500,000. All non-audit services 
where the fee for an individual contract exceeds $100,000, including 
audit-related services, require individual prior approval by the ARC. 
For audit or non-audit service contracts that do not exceed the relevant 
threshold, the matter is approved by management by delegated 
authority from the ARC and is subsequently presented for approval by 
the ARC. The ARC is mindful of the overall proportion of fees for audit 
and non-audit services in determining whether to approve such services.
Fees
After due consideration, the ARC approved the auditor's remuneration, 
satisfying itself that the level of fees payable in respect of the audit and 
non-audit services provided was appropriate and that an effective, 
high-quality audit could be conducted for such fees.
The total auditor's remuneration of $66 million (2022: $69 million, 
2021: $63 million) is categorised as follows: audit $64 million 
(2022: $65 million, 2021: 59 million); audit-related $2 million 
(2022: $3 million, 2021: $3 million); and all other fees $0 million 
(2022: $1 million, 2021: $1 million).
The scope of audit-related services contracted with the external auditor 
in 2023 consisted mainly of assurance and other attest services related 
to financial reporting.
see Note 34 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 290 provides details of the 
auditor's remuneration.

This Report
The Directors' Remuneration Report for 2023 has been prepared 
in accordance with relevant UK corporate governance and legal 
requirements, in particular Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The Board has approved this report.
As in previous years, this report is split into three sections: this 
Chair's letter, the Annual Report on Remuneration, and the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy (Policy). The Policy was last approved by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM with 94.6% support. No changes are 
being proposed to the Policy this year, though it is reproduced in full 
on pages 194-201 for ease of reference and in order to provide context 
to the decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) 
during the year.
Neil Carson 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholders, 
As always, the remuneration decisions by the Remuneration Committee 
(REMCO) for 2023 have been framed by the Group's broader 
performance context.
Wael Sawan became Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on January 1, 
2023. Very soon after, he streamlined the EC to further simplify the 
organisation as we seek to create more value with less emissions, 
and deliver increased shareholder returns through a balanced 
energy transition.
Shell delivered another set of strong financial results in 2023, despite 
lower commodity prices, with income of $19.6 billion, cash flow 
from operations (CFFO) of $54.2 billion, and free cash flow* of 
$36.5 billion. We delivered our second-highest Adjusted Earnings 
in a decade, after a record last year. This shows strong management 
performance, improved operational delivery and the resilience of our 
portfolio, despite external uncertainty and volatility. We were guided 
by our principles of performance, discipline and simplification as we 
reduced our net debt* to $43.5 billion, around half of what it was in 
2019, and as we continued to demonstrate prudence in our capital 
expenditure and reduction in structural costs.
Our financial results in 2023 were underpinned by strong operational 
performance across our portfolio. In the Gulf of Mexico, turnaround 
operations at Appomattox, Perdido and Olympus were safely 
completed ahead of schedule and below budget. In the second 
quarter, Prelude delivered its highest quarterly production since its
start-up in 2018. In December 2023, Shell and Eneco's CrossWind 
joint venture completed construction of the Hollandse Kust (Noord) 
wind farm. Capacity is anticipated to increase in the coming months 
to eventually reach 3.3 TWh a year, which is around 3% of the 
Netherlands' total demand for electricity. In Shenzhen, China, together 
with BYD, we have opened Shell's largest global charging site for 
electric vehicles, serving more than 3,300 customers a day. We are 
also making good progress across the targets outlined at Capital 
Markets Day (CMD) in June. Our strong performance in 2023 has 
allowed us to deliver shareholder distributions*of $23 billion for the 
year, exceeding the 30-40% of CFFO range set out at CMD 2023.
During the year, we reviewed our approach to considering fatalities, 
in order to support consistent and fair judgment of safety performance 
over time. I am saddened that we experienced three tragic incidents 
in 2023 at Shell-operated ventures, which resulted in four recordable 
fatalities that year. We reflected on these and Shell's broader safety 
performance, as we always do, when we determined the final pay 
outcomes for 2023, and we applied downward discretion to the 
annual bonus outcome. A fourth incident in late 2023 resulted in a 
further fatality in 2024. This will be assessed as part of the REMCO's 
considerations of safety performance outcomes for 2024. Further 
information is on page 180.

2023 remuneration outcomes
2023 annual bonus
The overall mathematical outcome of the annual bonus scorecard 
was above target at 1.58. The REMCO carefully considered the tragic 
incidents which resulted in fatalities in 2023. One contractor colleague 
in Malaysia died during scaffolding work and one in the Philippines 
died after a fall from height. In Nigeria, an armed ambush resulted in 
the death of two contractor colleagues, as well as four government 
agents. After careful consideration of the factors leading to the events 
and reflection on Shell's overall performance in 2023, including overall 
safety performance and the record performance in process safety, the 
REMCO used downward discretion to determine a final bonus outcome 
for Executive Directors of 1.55.
 
See page 181 for the complete scorecard with all targets, ranges and weightings, and a 
detailed discussion of performance against targets.
Vesting of the 2021 LTIP awards
Overall, the mathematical outcome of the Long-term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) was 94% of target. The REMCO was satisfied that no windfall 
gain had arisen. The REMCO also believes the vesting outcome to 
be representative of Shell's performance over the period.
 
See page 182 for full details of LTIP targets and weightings, and a discussion of performance 
against targets. 
Finalising the 2023 pay outcomes 
In finalising pay outcomes, the REMCO considered Shell's wider 
performance and context during 2023 and over the LTIP performance 
period, paying particular attention to:
￮ The strong financial performance in 2023, with CFFO of 
$54.2 billion and free cash flow* (FCF) of $36.5 billion, which has 
enabled Shell to invest in our businesses, reduce debt and enhance 
shareholder distributions;
￮ The shareholder experience, including total shareholder 
distributions* of $23 billion in 2023 and $58 billion over the LTIP 
performance period, and absolute and relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) performance over the same periods;
￮ Shell's performance beyond the formulaic outcomes of the variable 
pay structures, including safety (and fatalities), reputation, ethics and 
compliance, and feedback from the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) 
and the Sustainability Committee (SUSCO);
￮ Shareholders' views on remuneration matters, as shared with the 
REMCO during engagements in March 2023; 
￮ The employee experience, where the REMCO noted the above-
target vesting outcome for 2023 under the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP), used to make discretionary share awards below Senior 
Executive level, and the average employee salary increases; 
￮ Comparisons between the 2023 outcomes and historical 
remuneration levels; and
￮ The alignment of the 10-year average outcomes of the annual 
bonus scorecard (1.11) and LTIP (91% of target) to the target level, 
demonstrating the effective design of the structures and the integrity 
of the target-setting process.
This resulted in a single figure outcome of £7.9 million for the CEO and 
£3.9 million for the CFO, noting that both individuals' 2021 LTIP awards 
were made prior to their appointment to the Board. The REMCO was 
satisfied that the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy had operated 
as intended, and these outcomes were appropriate in the context of 
Company performance and the target pay opportunity.
[A] Policy target and maximum based on the shareholder-approved 2023 Remuneration Policy in respect of the annual bonus and the LTIP. Salary, pension and benefits are based on 2023 data.
[B] Incremental remuneration in respect of 2022 for services as CEO Designate, in anticipation of becoming CEO in 2023.

2024 remuneration
The 2023 Remuneration Policy was submitted to shareholders at 
the 2023 AGM, and received strong support. I would like to thank 
shareholders for their valued input and engagement prior to the AGM. 
The REMCO has appreciated the diverse range of views from our 
shareholders and they were invaluable in shaping our Remuneration 
Policy and design.
2024 salaries
Effective January 1, 2024, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received 
a salary increase of 3.9% and their salaries for 2024 are £1,455,000 
and £961,000, respectively. In reviewing their salaries, the REMCO 
considered carefully the external environment, including the increases 
provided to the Shell workforce in the key markets of the UK (4.5%), 
the USA (3.1%), and the Netherlands (4.3%). The Executive Directors' 
increases for 2024 were positioned below the average UK increase 
and in line with the average increases across the key markets. The 
REMCO also recognised the multiplier effect on total remuneration.
2024 annual bonus
The REMCO is satisfied that the current mix of financial and non-
financial measures remains well-aligned with our strategic and 
operational priorities. The "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
measure has been updated for Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24). See section below for further details.
In the interest of simplification and alignment of the two Executive 
Directors in delivering the operating plan (which is the primary focus 
of the annual bonus), the CFO's target bonus will be aligned to that 
of the CEO from 2024, at 125% of salary. This is within the confines 
of the existing shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy.

The performance conditions and weightings will be unchanged for the 
2024 LTIP awards. The measures will be cash generation, TSR, organic 
free cash flow*(OFCF) and "Shell's journey in the energy transition", 
and they will be weighted equally. Cash generation and TSR 
performance will be measured against the energy majors as before, 
and OFCF will be measured on an absolute basis against annual 
operating plans. The "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
performance condition has been updated for ETS24. See section 
below for further details.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).
"Shell's journey in the energy transition" in variable 
remuneration
The achievement of Shell's plans for the energy transition has been 
linked to the annual bonus and LTIP for a number of years with "Shell's 
journey in the energy transition" currently forming 15% of the annual 
bonus scorecard and 25% of the LTIP. These weightings will continue 
in 2024 and the REMCO has adjusted the performance metrics in light 
of ETS24, continuing to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming 
a net-zero emissions business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy 
transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, 
while helping to build the clean energy system of the future.
Shell's strategy sets out its objectives for reducing operational emissions 
while supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. Shell's plans 
cover all its businesses: growing its world-leading LNG business; 
reducing emissions from oil and gas production; and growing sales of 
low-carbon products. These objectives are reflected in the scorecard, 
where a measure of LNG volumes, focussing on the operational 
performance of the LNG business, will be introduced for 2024. LNG is 
a critical fuel for the energy transition. It provides energy security and 
flexibility, and is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% 
less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity. 
Shell's intent is to grow LNG and the REMCO will reflect this by 
measuring LNG liquefaction volumes. The existing GHG abatement 
metric, targeting the operational actions Shell can take to reduce 
emissions in support of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
under our operational control by 2030 on a net basis (compared with 
2016 baseline), is retained. Our ambitions to develop new lower-
carbon offerings for our customers is represented by the existing 
electric vehicle charge point rollout measure, aligning to Shell's plan to 
become a global leader in public charging for electric vehicles.
In the LTIP, the REMCO's determination of the extent to which awards 
will vest will be based on the REMCO's holistic assessment of progress 
towards reducing Shell's operational emissions and supporting our 
customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to 
net-zero climate targets for our own operations, progress in 
developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, 
such as the development of our Power business (including renewables), 
lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, advanced biofuels, electric vehicle charging, 
hydrogen, and carbon, capture and storage (CCS). We will also take 
into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in net 
carbon intensity (NCI) by 2030 (compared with 2016 baseline) and a 
15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products 
by 2030 (compared with 2021 baseline), as well as any other factors the 
REMCO may consider relevant.
Looking ahead
I hope that you find this report presents a clear account of the 
REMCO's decisions for the year. I look forward to continuing 
to engage with our shareholders in the coming months.

[A] In the Directors' Remuneration Report, Senior Management is defined as Executive 
Directors, other EC members, Company Secretary, and EVP Controller.
The REMCO is also responsible for determining the Chair of the 
Board's remuneration. The REMCO monitors the level and structure 
of remuneration for senior executives below Senior Management. 
When setting the Policy for Executive Director remuneration, the 
REMCO reviews and considers workforce remuneration and related 
policies, and how pay and benefits align with culture. In exercising 
its responsibilities, the REMCO takes into account a variety of 
stakeholder considerations.
The REMCO operates within its Terms of Reference, which are 
reviewed annually (last reviewed in July 2023), and are available 
on shell.com.
Advice from within Shell was provided by:
￮ Chief Executive Officer (CEO);
￮ Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer and Secretary
to the REMCO; and 
￮ Executive Vice President Performance and Reward.
The Chair of the Board was consulted on remuneration proposals 
affecting the CEO. The CEO was consulted on proposals relating
to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Senior Management.
The REMCO met four times in 2023 and its activities included:
￮ determining vesting of the 2020 LTIP award for Senior Management;
￮ determining 2023 target bonus opportunities and 2023 LTIP awards 
for Senior Management;
￮ setting 2023 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and

in US Dollars  9,873  —  4,801  3,549 
in Euros  9,128  —  4,439  3,366 
[A] Wael Sawan was appointed CEO and a Board Director effective January 1, 2023.
[B] Sinead Gorman was appointed CFO and a Board Director effective April 1, 2022. Accordingly, her remuneration for 2022 relates to the period April 1 to December 31, 2022. See 2022 
Directors' Remuneration Report for further details.
[C] Base salary: Wael Sawan's base salary was set at £1,400,000 on his appointment to the Board. Sinead Gorman's base salary for 2023 was set at £925,000 (+2.8% from 2022).
[D] Benefits: in respect of 2023, Wael Sawan's benefits included time-limited relocation-related costs (£334,778), car allowance (£29,890), and gross-up costs (£9,829). Sinead Gorman's 
benefits included time-limited relocation-related costs (£128,319), car allowance (£29,890), and gross-up costs (£36,082).
[E] Pension: Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received cash in lieu of pension contributions equal to 20% of base salary in 2023.
[F] Annual bonus: the full value of the bonus in respect of performance in 2023, comprising both the 50% delivered in cash and 50% bonus delivered in shares. For 2024, the market price of 
shares on February 26, 2024 for London-listed shares (£24.94) was used to determine the number of shares delivered, resulting in 28,796 ordinary shares for Wael Sawan and 18,276 
ordinary shares for Sinead Gorman, net of tax.
[G] LTIP: the amounts reported for 2023 relate to the 2021 LTIP award, which vested on March 7, 2024, at the market price of €29.27 and £24.75 for Amsterdam-listed and London-listed 
ordinary shares, respectively. The value in respect of the LTIP is calculated as the product of: (i) the number of shares of the original award multiplied by the vesting percentage, plus accrued 
dividend shares, and (ii) the market price of ordinary shares at the vesting date. The market price of the Amsterdam-listed shares is converted into GBP using the exchange rate on the vesting 
date. Share price appreciation accounted for €1,026,217 for Wael Sawan and £324,230 for Sinead Gorman. The amounts shown for Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman both relate to 
awards made prior to their appointment to the Board, and are shown here for transparency. The performance measures are the same as those applying to LTIP awards made to Executive 
Directors.
[H] Incremental remuneration in respect of 2022 for services as CEO Designate, in anticipation of becoming CEO in 2023. Wael Sawan did not perform the role of CEO during the CEO 
Designate time period. Amount includes pro rata salary and performance bonus, plus time-limited relocation-related costs.

Pension
During the year, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman were eligible 
to participate in the defined contribution UK Shell Pension Plan with 
an employer contribution rate of up to 20% of salary, or take this as 
a pension cash alternative. The UK Shell Pension Plan or associated 
pension cash alternative is available to new Shell employees in the 
UK at the same contribution levels and currently around half of UK 
employees participate in these arrangements. The majority of the 
remainder participate in a legacy defined benefit plan, which closed 
to new members in March 2013.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is intended to reward the delivery of short-term 
targets derived from the operating plan. The REMCO reviews the 
bonus measures, weightings and targets annually to evolve with Shell's 
strategy and circumstances, and to ensure that the targets remain 
stretching but realistic. For 2023, the mathematical bonus outcome 
was 1.58. The REMCO reviewed performance against the scorecard, 
as below.
Financial delivery (35% weighting): we delivered $54.2 billion of 
CFFO against our target of $44 billion, helped by a robust macro 
and operational performance as well as working capital inflows. 
This exceeded our outstanding performance threshold of $54 billion, 
leading to a maximum outcome on this measure. As a reminder, the 
REMCO has a long-standing policy of not adjusting remuneration 
measures to take account of changes in energy prices and currency 
fluctuations, which supports alignment between pay outcomes and 
the shareholder experience. 
Operational excellence (35%): a key underpin of our performance, 
operational excellence ensures we deliver for our customers and drive 
financial performance:
￮ Asset management excellence: Upstream controllable availability 
was outstanding with excellent performance in Gulf of Mexico 
(GOM), Kashagan, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and 
Bonga. Midstream availability was below target. Chemicals and 
Refining availability was also below target as a result of challenges 
at Shell Polymers Monaca (USA) as well as the recovery after a fire 
in Deer Park (USA) earlier in the year. 
￮ Project delivery excellence: project delivery was above target. 
Highlights for the year include the successful start-ups of Vito (USA) 
and Oman Gas (Block 10) Phase 1 in the first quarter, with Timi 
(Malaysia) coming on stream in the second half of the year. The year 
ended on a high note with Mero-2 (Brazil) coming on stream in late 
December.
￮ Customer excellence: Customer Satisfaction Index was above target. 
This was driven by continued improvements in our customer platform 
and coordinated efforts to proactively communicate with our 
customers and manage demand during supply chain challenges, as 
well as dynamic pricing changes. Our Brand Share Preference was 
also above target.
Overall the outcome for operational excellence was above target.

"Shell's journey in the energy transition" (15%): 
￮ Selling lower-carbon products: performance is measured based on 
the proportion of earnings in the Marketing segment coming from 
lower-carbon energy products, as well as non-energy products (see 
page 181 for the list of products included in this metric). We are 
below target for a range of reasons including lower lubricants 
demand and higher costs for lower-carbon Mobility products.
￮ Reducing operational emissions: performance is assessed based on 
GHG abatement projects that result in ongoing Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
reductions such as flare reduction and energy efficiency projects, site 
closures, decommissioning and transformations, and increasing the 
use of renewable electricity in our operations. This metric does not 
include the impact of divestments and acquisitions. The 2023 
outcome was outstanding, reflecting the cumulative effects of actions 
across the portfolio, which support our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 
operational emissions by 2030 on a net basis (2016 baseline). 
This includes abatement projects, use of renewable energy, and 
permanent shutdowns or conversions ("right-sizing") of assets.
￮ Partnering to decarbonise: we are building an electric vehicle charging 
business to help decarbonise road transport. In 2023 we opened 60 
new electric vehicle hubs in China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
Germany, including our biggest electric vehicle site in the world in 
China, together with our joint-venture partner BYD.
Overall the score on the "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
measure was above target.
Safety (15%): it remains our priority to run our day-to-day operations 
safely and ensure the well-being of all our people.
￮ Process safety continues to be measured through the number of
Tier 1 and 2 operational safety incidents and was above maximum, 
with 63 events recorded compared with 66 in 2022, setting a new 
record for Shell, confirming our top-tier performance in the industry.
￮ Personal safety SIF-F performance is assessed based on the number of 
serious incidents which might occur in Shell's businesses based on the 
work plan for the year and our knowledge of industry incident rates. 
Our ultimate goal is zero harm to people working for Shell. Overall, 
2023 SIF-F performance was of a similar magnitude to 2022 (which 
was itself a marked improvement from prior years), which is testament 
to the ongoing focus of our employees in keeping colleagues safe.
Overall, the score on the safety measure was at maximum. While 
underlying safety performance was strong, we tragically lost contractor 
colleagues during 2023. The REMCO reflected carefully on these 
events and Shell's broader safety performance and determined 
that the bonus outcome should be adjusted downwards to 1.55 
(see "The REMCO's reflections on safety" below).
The REMCO's reflections on safety
Safety is Shell's first priority and our Powering Progress strategy is 
underpinned by this. It is critical that our operations run safely every 
day and that we strive to ensure the well-being of all of our people.
Shell uses Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) as our 
scorecard measure for personal safety performance. SIF-F tracks 
the frequency at which injuries with life-changing consequences 
occur under Shell operational control. This allows us to focus 
management and organisation attention on the most serious 
incidents. We assess process safety using the number of Tier 1 and 
2 events. This tracks the frequency of unplanned or uncontrolled 
releases of materials from Shell's operations.
Some shareholders have asked how we approach target-setting 
for the SIF-F metric. To be clear, our ultimate target is zero harm to 
people. We have made good progress in reducing the number of 
personal safety events over a long period of time, with reductions 
in the number of fatalities and injuries (see chart below).
Personal safety performance 2000-2023
SIF-F is an important tool to drive further improvement in safety 
and take us closer to our goal of zero harm. The metric focuses 
management and organisational attention on those incidents with 
the potential to cause most damage. To assess performance, the 
REMCO sets clear performance ranges based on historical 
outcomes, industry benchmarks, and taking account of our 
planned activities for the year.
Following discussions with shareholders in 2023, the REMCO 
reviewed its approach to considering fatalities. It determined to 
retain SIF-F and to avoid formulaic mechanisms. The REMCO 
chose to adopt a discretionary framework which takes account 
of multiple reflection points, including the circumstances of the 
fatalities, consideration of systemic issues, the wider safety 
context, and any safety events outside of the reporting framework. 
This framework supports holistic and detailed consideration of 
the circumstances arising, and consistent and fair judgement 
of safety performance over time.
In 2023, four contractors under Shell operational control lost their 
lives in tragic incidents. Four government security agents also died 
in one of those incidents. With two of the incidents, the root causes 
have been identified as design and human factors during the 
operation of physical assets: one contractor colleague in Malaysia 
tragically died during scaffolding work and one contractor 
colleague in the Philippines died after a fall from height. The other 
incident in Nigeria, where a contractor convoy which included the 
government agents was ambushed by unknown gunmen in late 
December 2023, remains under investigation.
In 2023, aside from fatalities, the outstanding personal and 
process safety performance achieved in 2022 was sustained. The 
portion of incidents where barriers and controls were effective in 
avoiding tragic outcomes (i.e. "failed safe") was higher than in the 
prior year. Process safety performance as measured by API Tier 1 
& 2 events was the lowest on record and at top quartile of the 
industry benchmark.
After careful consideration of Shell's holistic safety performance 
in 2023 including the outcome of the formal metrics, the four 
recordable fatalities that occurred during 2023, and Shell's long-
term progress on safety using the discretionary framework, the 
REMCO has determined that the scorecard outcome for Executive 
Directors should be adjusted downwards from 1.58 to 1.55. The 
reduction in the bonus outcome as a result of the adjustment is 
equal to c.4% of salary for both Executive Directors.
In February 2024, a contractor injured in a December 2023 
tugboat fire incident in Nigeria sadly died. While this is reflected 
in the 2023 SIF-F outcome, it will be assessed as part of the 
REMCO's considerations of safety performance outcomes for 2024.

The table below summarises the 2023 annual bonus scorecard measures including their weightings, targets and outcomes.
 2023 annual bonus scorecard measures and weightings
[A] Upstream controllable availability: 87.3% (Threshold 82.2%, Target 84.2%, Outstanding 86.2%); Midstream availability: 89.1% (Threshold 88.4%, Target 90.4%, Outstanding 92.4%); 
Chemicals and Refinery availability: 91.2% (Threshold 93.1%, Target 94.1%, Outstanding 95.1%). Performance assessment is equally weighted between Upstream, Midstream, and Chemicals 
and Refining.
[B] Projects delivered on schedule: 82% (Threshold 30%, Target 65%, Outstanding 100%); project delivery on budget: 104.8% (Threshold 110%, Target 103%, Outstanding 96%). Performance 
assessment is equally weighted between projects delivered on schedule and on budget.
[C] Customer Satisfaction Index: 8.4 (Threshold 7.6, Target 8.1, Outstanding 8.6); Brand Share Preference: 14.2% (Threshold 13.0%, Target 13.7-13.8%, Outstanding 14.5%). Performance 
assessment is equally weighted between Customer Satisfaction Index and Brand Share Preference.
[D] Based on the percentage of Adjusted Earnings in the Marketing segment from lower-carbon energy products (on a life-cycle basis), defined as biofuels and electric vehicle charging, as well as 
non-energy products, defined as lubricants, bitumen, sulphur (agriculture and forestry), and earnings from convenience retail.
Accordingly, the REMCO decided the final bonus outcome should be 155% of target and 77.5% of maximum. This results in a bonus of 
£2,710,000 for Wael Sawan and £1,720,000 for Sinead Gorman.

Long-term Incentive Plan vesting: 2021 LTIP
In 2021, Ben van Beurden and Jessica Uhl, at the time Executive 
Directors, were granted conditional share awards under the LTIP. The 
vesting of these awards is discussed in the "Payments to past Directors" 
section on page 188.
Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman's 2021 LTIP awards are also 
disclosed for transparency, although they were not Executive Directors 
at the time of the award.
In determining the vesting outcome, the REMCO considered Shell's 
performance over the three-year period January 1, 2021 to December 
31, 2023:
￮ Relative CFFO: on a relative basis as compared against the 2020 
base year, Shell ranked fifth, resulting in 0% vesting for this 
performance condition. 
￮ Relative TSR: over the performance period, Shell returned around 
$58 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share 
buybacks, whilst TSR was 92%. Relative to the other energy majors, 
Shell's TSR ranked second, resulting in 150% vesting for this 
performance condition.
￮ Relative ROACE: Shell's absolute 2023 ROACE for LTIP purposes 
was 7.2% (note that ROACE for the LTIP calculation is based on 
disclosed net income and is not adjusted for the after-tax interest 
expense and therefore differs from ROACE as calculated for 
purposes other than remuneration). On a relative growth basis 
compared with the 2020 base year, Shell ranked fourth, resulting 
in 0% of vesting for this performance condition.
￮ Absolute FCF: strong performance in all three years resulted in total 
FCF of $122.8 billion, above our maximum threshold of $71 billion. 
This resulted in a 200% of target vesting outcome on this 
performance condition.
￮ Absolute energy transition: the outcome of this performance 
condition is determined holistically by the REMCO, taking account of 
Shell's performance against defined performance indicators and also
Shell's wider performance as it transitions to a net-zero emissions 
energy business. Overall, the REMCO determined the vesting 
outcome as 120% of target. Commentary on energy transition 
performance is provided below. 
 2021 LTIP vesting outcomes – performance measures
 Our carbon targets
In 2023 we continued our progress on our path to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. At the end of 2023, we had reduced 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 31%, and the NCI of our energy products by 6.3% from our 2016 baseline.
[A] 2021 target 2-3% reduction, 2022 target 3-4% reduction, and 2023 target 6-8% 
reduction; all achieved.

2021 LTIP energy transition performance condition: outcome
Outcomes for the energy transition performance condition are determined by the REMCO based on quantitative performance and a qualitative 
assessment focused on Shell's short-term NCI reduction target and those elements that we understood at the time would make the most impact 
on achieving our goals over the three-year performance period relating to NCI: the growth of our power business, the growth of lower-carbon 
products, and the development of systems to absorb, capture and store carbon. This approach to the LTIP is intended to support experimentation 
and learning as to what actions will help deliver net-zero emissions in a profitable way. Accordingly, the REMCO uses the performance indicators 
as guidance, rather than applying a formulaic vesting outcome, when making its decisions.
 
Net carbon intensity (NCI) - performance indicator met
We achieved our short-term target for the 2021-23 LTIP cycle to reduce our NCI by 6-8% compared with the 2016 baseline, with a 6.3% reduction 
by 2023. In making its decision, the REMCO reviewed how the target was met including changing product sales, the use of emission offsets, such 
as carbon credits, and the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates, recognising the importance of these in the energy transition.
Growing the power business - performance indicator substantively met
A key element of the purpose of the early cycles of the LTIP was to encourage learning about how to profitably decarbonise and the REMCO paid 
close attention to management's work to refine the strategic direction for the Power business over the performance cycle. This has changed from an 
emphasis on growth in the customer base to a more selective focus on those areas where Shell has competitive advantages in the optimisation and 
marketing of molecules, enabling Shell to generate returns and create shareholder value. For example, in 2023 Shell undertook a strategic review of 
its consumer power retail business in Europe, which was determined not fitting for that revised strategy and hence was divested with a connected 
reduction in sales volumes. Stretching targets around growing Shell's power sales were set (original target 340 TWh/year with 279 TWh/year 
achieved in 2023), with attention also on decarbonising those power sales, with targets for creating a pipeline of renewable power generation 
capacity options (target of 5-10 GW well exceeded with 41.4 GW at the close of 2023) and generating renewable power sales (offtake volumes 
target of 3 GW also exceeded with 4.9 GW). A target was also set for a 16-22% reduction in carbon intensity for the Power Portfolio against the 
2020 base year. Changes in reporting methodology mean it is not possible to compare 2023 intensities against 2020 on a like-for-like basis. 
However, the REMCO noted the steady decrease in carbon intensity for the Power Portfolio over the cycle (2021: 66 gCO2e/MJ; 2022: 58 gCO2e/
MJ; 2023: 49 gCO2e/MJ). In assessing the outcome, the REMCO also noted the strong wider progress made over the performance period, and in 
particular the strategic acquisitions of Sprng in 2022 and Savion in 2021 which provide important platforms for growing future low-carbon offerings in 
solar. Meanwhile in wind, 2023 saw the significant milestone of our CrossWind offshore wind joint venture in the Netherlands becoming operational.
Growing new lower-carbon product offerings - performance indicator partially met
Shell is investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen and biofuels, working closely with customers to help 
identify the products they need to decarbonise. Metrics for the performance cycle were designed to encourage development across this range of 
offerings, against which the REMCO noted a number of successes. Shell is one of the world's largest traders of biofuels and our Brazilian joint venture 
Raizen (Shell interest 44%) is one of the world's largest producers and blenders of biofuels. This is a position that has been further developed over the 
performance period with the acquisition of Nature Energy, making Shell Europe's largest producer of renewable natural gas (RNG), and with 
commencing construction of the Shell Rotterdam Biofuels hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) facility, which will be amongst the largest in 
Europe when on stream. The REMCO also set a target for 8,000 out-of-home electric vehicle charge points which was well exceeded with more than 
54,000 as Shell looks to leverage its global network of service stations and existing strengths of the marketing business to generate returns. Balancing 
this, the REMCO also reflected on the fact that many of the commercial pathways for these offerings are emerging more slowly than anticipated. 
Holland Hydrogen 1 provides 200 MW of production capacity and is an important platform for future hydrogen development. This is below the 
ambitious target of 500 MW originally set for this LTIP cycle. However, on balance, the REMCO considered this a strong outcome as customer 
demand, technology de-risking and proven business models for hydrogen continue to develop. A target of 6 mtpa of carbon abated through the 
deployment of low-carbon fuels was also narrowly missed (5.3 mtpa achieved). Finally, a target was set for three investments in commercial-scale 
advanced biofuels projects. While two were achieved (LanzaJet and Enerkem Varennes), technology platforms and commercially viable pathways 
proved slower to develop than anticipated and CAPEX was redeployed.
Develop emissions sinks - performance indicator not met
The development of systems that capture and store or absorb carbon is required as part of the global response to climate change to reduce and 
compensate for emissions where there are not currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. The REMCO originally set a target of 25 mtpa CO2 offset by 
carbon credits through carbon-neutral customer offerings. 4 mtpa was achieved as customer demand and willingness to pay for these types of offering 
failed to materialise at the rate anticipated. Targets were also set for maturing carbon, capture, utilisation, and storage projects to final investment 
decision. Against the original target of three projects, two were achieved, highlighting the high degree of stretch in the original targets. The REMCO 
was comfortable that the outcome reflected commercial decision-making by the business in support of appropriate value creation.
Overall, the REMCO determined that the energy transition measure (accounting for 20% of the award) should vest at 120% of target.
The REMCO considered the Company's share price at the time of the 
awards, and determined to reduce the 2021 LTIP awards by 11.8% 
and 8.0% from the usual target award levels for Ben van Beurden 
and Jessica Uhl, respectively. The REMCO was cognisant of possible 
windfall gains arising from share price volatility in 2020, and took 
decisive action upfront to reduce awards at the start of the cycle to 
moderate the potential impact on LTIP award values. Notwithstanding 
the REMCO's proactive approach at the time of award, following the 
conclusion of the performance period, the REMCO further reflected on 
the share price at award and on vesting, noting that share price 
appreciation accounted for 34% of the total value of Wael Sawan's 
LTIP at vest. Taking this and the reduction to the initial awards into 
account, the REMCO was satisfied that the potential for windfall gains 
had been appropriately addressed.
The REMCO decided that the LTIP outcome was consistent with the 
target opportunity and intended operation of the plan under the Policy 
and appropriate, and therefore no adjustment to the vesting outcome 
was required. Accordingly, the REMCO decided that the LTIP should 
vest at 94% of target (equivalent to 47% of maximum).
The overall LTIP vesting outcomes for Wael Sawan and Sinead 
Gorman, including an illustration of the impact of share price 
movements and accrued dividends, are set out below. Wael Sawan 
was an Executive Committee member during 2021, and therefore his 
vested 2021 award is subject to a further three-year holding period 
which extends beyond his tenure as Executive Director, in line with the 
policy for Executive Committee members (and Executive Directors). 
Sinead Gorman was a Senior Executive during 2021, and therefore 
her vested 2021 award is not subject to further holding, though the 
shareholding guideline policy is applicable.

 2021 LTIP vesting outcome
Consideration of 2023 single figure outcomes
In determining the final single figure outcomes for 2023, the REMCO also considered the personal performance of the Executive Directors.
 Personal performance 
The Executive Directors have demonstrated strong leadership in 2023. 
CEO Wael Sawan has made changes early in his tenure to simplify the 
Executive Committee for greater alignment, focus and accountability, 
enabling faster and better decision-making. Together with CFO Sinead 
Gorman, he has brought organisational focus on performance, 
discipline and simplification, driving an approach of creating more 
value while reducing emissions.
Key successes are noted throughout this report, particularly on page 
179 on the 2023 annual bonus and page 182 on the 2021 LTIP vesting 
outcome, and additional comments are provided below.
The sector faces many challenges. Critical to a successful 2023 has 
been Wael's leadership of the organisation, setting out an agenda to 
deliver increased shareholder returns through a balanced energy 
transition, helping to provide the secure energy the world needs whilst 
making progress towards our net-zero emissions targets. Demonstrating 
this focus, Capital Markets Day (CMD) in June 2023 set out a plan to 
operationalise the Powering Progress strategy with a clear and concise 
set of targets presented to the market. The Energy Transition Strategy 
2024 (ETS24), worked on extensively by the leadership team in 2023, 
is another example of clear focus and effective collaboration (see the 
Shell Energy Transition Strategy 2024 on shell.com). By the end of 
2023, key achievements also included:
￮ Delivery of strong financial results with net income of $19.6 billion 
and Adjusted Earnings* of $28.3 billion, and CFFO of $54.2 billion 
against plan target of $44 billion, reflecting continuous high-grading 
of our upstream assets and the strength of our trading businesses;
￮ Delivery of $23 billion of shareholder distributions* in 2023, 2% 
above the 30-40% of CFFO promised at CMD 2023;
￮ Reduction of net debt* to $43.5 billion;
￮ Continued refining of the portfolio, agreeing to sell home energy 
businesses in the UK and Germany, as well as the Shell Pakistan 
business;
￮ Delivery of improved operational performance, including Pearl GTL 
reaching 97% availability in the second quarter of 2023, one of its 
highest to date; and new production coming on line at the Timi 
platform in Malaysia which is powered by wind and solar energy, 
and lighter than a conventional platform, reducing both costs and 
emissions;
￮ Continued delivery of a range of lower-carbon projects including 
our CrossWind joint venture designed to produce the equivalent 
of around 3% of Dutch electricity demand; the opening of Shell's 
largest global charging site for electric vehicles in Shenzhen, China; 
and producing biofuel from sugar cane waste at the new second-
generation ethanol plant, the world's largest, in our joint venture 
Raízen in Brazil;
￮ Setting out a clear framework in CMD for a simplified set of financial 
and carbon targets for the coming three years and in doing so, building 
Shell's investment case through the energy transition. Over the period 
between CMD and December 31, 2023, total returns have been 13.4% 
(compared with 8.5% for a global oil and gas index);
￮ Preparing for ETS24, published on March 14, 2024;
￮ Continuing Shell's role in shaping the broader energy conversation 
through engagements at CERAWeek, ADIPEC, and Energy 
Intelligence Forum and Shell's publication of new Energy Security 
scenarios (Archipelagos and Sky 2050);
￮ Maintaining a strong tone of care and safety ethos; and
￮ Maintaining Group-wide top quartile 2023 people survey scores 
for employee engagement and team leadership, alongside 
improvements in other areas that are key to our success such 
as collaboration and learner mindset.

During 2023, Sinead Gorman assumed responsibilities for strategy 
and sustainability in addition to finance. Working closely with the 
CEO, Sinead Gorman has played a pivotal role in delivering a year 
characterised by strong financial results, improved financial resilience 
and capital discipline. She has steered the finance function's disciplined 
capital stewardship and effective management of Shell's financial 
framework, allowing Shell to meet its organisational objectives and 
commitments to shareholders. By the end of 2023, Sinead Gorman's 
key achievements included:
￮ Playing a critical role in coordinating and driving the review that 
led to CMD 2023;
￮ Leading the team preparing for ETS24, taking stock of our progress, 
seeing what we have learnt, and supporting the team and the Board 
to consider the strategic choices as we transform Shell;
￮ Bringing significant focus to lease management as well as working 
capital management;
￮ Expanding the Tax Contribution Report to disclose not only the 
corporate income tax we paid across 97 countries but also our 
total tax contribution in more than half of these; and
￮ Driving healthy challenge on capital expenditure, allowing 
tightening of the range from $23-27 billion to $23-25 billion earlier 
than expected and allowing Shell to make shareholder distributions 
at the higher end of our guided range.
The REMCO also considered a range of other factors in finalising 
its remuneration decisions for 2023, including:
￮ Shell's performance in 2023 and over the LTIP performance period 
2021-2023, and the formulaic outcomes of the bonus and the LTIP 
performance conditions;
￮ The impact of fatalities on the formulaic scorecard outcome;
￮ Absolute and relative TSR performance over the period;
￮ A range of factors that take account of Shell's performance beyond 
the formulaic outcomes of the variable pay structures, including 
safety, reputation, ethics and compliance, and feedback from the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee;
￮ The external environment and wider stakeholder experience, 
including shareholders' expectations with regard to executive 
pay decision-making and the employee experience;
￮ The Executive Directors' remuneration compared with the 
variable pay outcomes for the general workforce;
￮ The alignment of the Executive Directors with the shareholder 
experience through their high shareholding requirements; and
￮ The Executive Directors' remuneration compared with 
historical outcomes.
After reflecting on the above factors, the REMCO was satisfied 
that the Policy had operated as intended, and that the single 
figure outcomes for the CEO and the CFO represented a fair 
level of remuneration.
2023 LTIP
 Scheme interests awarded to Executive Directors in 2023 (audited)
In 2023, the Executive Directors were awarded conditional share awards under the LTIP as set out in the table below. In approving the awards, 
the REMCO considered Shell's historical share price, including the share price over the prior year, and noted that the share price at award was 
around 20% higher than in 2022, and higher than average historical levels. The REMCO determined that the risk of windfall gain was limited, 
and therefore no adjustment was made to the award size.

[A] The awards for both Executive Directors were made based on the closing market price on the date of grant, February 3, 2023, for ordinary shares of £24.14.
[B] Minimum performance relates to the lowest level of achievement, for which no reward is given.
The performance conditions and weightings applying to LTIP awards 
made in 2023 were: relative cash generation (25% weighting), relative 
TSR (25%), absolute OFCF (25%), and energy transition (25%).
Relative performance conditions
The relative performance conditions are based on our performance on 
key financial and external measures against our closest comparators. 
For each measure, we rank point-to-point growth based on the data 
points at the end of the performance period compared with those at 
the beginning of the period.
Cash generation is defined as CFFO divided by average capital 
employed, and measures Shell's ability to generate the top-line cash 
flow to finance investment in our business and shareholder distributions.
TSR measures actual value created for shareholders (i.e. change in 
share price plus dividends), and as in prior years, is calculated in US 
dollars using a 90-day averaging period.
Vesting under each relative performance condition is assessed 
independently, with the vesting outcome ranging from 0% to 200% 
of the target award in respect of the measure, in accordance with 
the following vesting schedule:
￮ Ranking first equals 200% vesting;
￮ Ranking second equals 150% vesting;
￮ Ranking third equals 80% vesting; and
￮ Ranking fourth or fifth equals 0% vesting.
Outperforming Shell's closest competitors on key financial metrics is 
challenging. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median performance 
is generally set at a limit of 25% of maximum for other UK companies, 
but notes that this is typically applied against a larger comparator 
group. A vesting outcome of 80% for median performance (40% of 
maximum) in a small comparator group is considered appropriate 
by the REMCO.

Absolute measures
Organic free cash flow (OFCF)
The OFCF performance condition supports the delivery of our cash 
flow priorities, which are to service and reduce debt, pay dividends, 
buy back shares, and make future capital investments. 
The performance targets for OFCF are set by reference to Shell's 
annual operating plans, based on the sum of plan OFCF targets over 
the three-year performance period, and updating the plan each year to 
reflect a changing price premise. The REMCO has a long-standing no-
adjustments policy, and believes it is more appropriate to set the target 
based on the aggregation of the annual operating plans rather than 
setting a three-year target at the outset and making necessary 
adjustments at the end. OFCF targets are disclosed retrospectively 
and in aggregate, following the conclusion of the three-year period.
Under the OFCF performance condition, achievement of threshold 
performance will result in 40% of the target award (20% of maximum) 
in respect of the OFCF vesting, increasing to full vesting for 
achievement of outstanding performance. A straight-line vesting 
schedule will apply for performance between threshold and 
outstanding. In 2023, the performance condition moved from FCF 
to OFCF to place greater emphasis on the operational outcomes.
Energy transition
For the 2023 award, the energy transition performance condition 
is based on NCI reduction and the supporting strategic themes of 
reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions; building a renewable power 
business; growing new low-carbon energy offerings; and developing 
emission sinks and offsets with the REMCO making a holistic 
assessment of progress when making the vesting decision. The key 
factors in the REMCO's decision will be disclosed at the end of 
the performance period (unless commercially sensitive).
Under CMD, a number of long-term performance indicators were 
retired, and therefore the REMCO's determination of the extent to 
which awards will vest will be based on:
￮ Shell's related climate targets of short-term NCI reduction target 
of 9-13% by 2025 and halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions under 
operational control by 2030 on a net basis (2016 baselines);
￮ A qualitative assessment of the strategic context and business 
environment for the strategic themes; and 
￮ A quantitative assessment of delivery of the operating plans for 
those businesses with most responsibility for the strategic themes.
 
For an update on Shell's energy transition, see the 2024 Shell Energy Transition Strategy 
from shell.com.
TSR underpin
If Shell's TSR ranking is fourth or fifth, the level of the 2023 award that 
can vest on the basis of the other measures will be capped at 50% of 
the maximum.
Performance update on FCF/OFCF
2022 LTIP award 
At December 31, 2023, FCF* performance was above target, with 
a strong outcome of $46 billion for 2022 (target $18 billion), and 
$36.5 billion for 2023 (target $24 billion). As one year of FCF 
performance remains, and 80% of the award is subject to relative 
and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect 
the potential vesting of the award.
2023 LTIP award 
At December 31, 2023, OFCF* performance was above target, based 
on $35.9 billion for 2023 (target $22 billion). As two years of OFCF 
performance remain, and 75% of the award is subject to relative 
and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect 
the potential vesting of the award.

[A] UK regulations require the inclusion of benefits where these would be taxable in the UK, on the assumption that Directors are tax residents in the UK. On this premise, the taxable benefits 
include the cost of a Non-executive Director's occasional business-required partner travel. Shell also pays for travel between home and the head office, where Board and Committee meetings 
are typically held, and related hotel and subsistence costs. For consistency, business expenses for travel between home and the head office are not reported as taxable benefits because for 
most Non-executive Directors this is international travel and hence would not be taxable in the UK.

Statement of Directors' shareholding and share
interests (audited)
Shareholding guidelines
The REMCO believes that Executive Directors should align their 
interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in Shell plc.
Only unfettered shares count towards an Executive Director's 
shareholding. Shares delivered that are subject to holding requirements 
also count towards the guidelines. The CEO and the CFO have five 
years from their respective appointment to the Board to achieve their 
respective shareholding requirements.
There is a Company-sponsored nominee account for each employee 
which allows for restrictions to be applied on the sale or transfer of 
shares that are subject to holding periods. The restrictions remain 
in force beyond the Executive Director's employment.
 
Further details of the shareholding guidelines can be found on page 196.

The changes to Directors' shareholdings as at March 8, 2024
are as follows:
￮ Wael Sawan's share interest increased by 82,797 ordinary shares 
after the delivery of the 2023 annual bonus shares and the vesting of 
the 2021 LTIP award; and
￮ Sinead Gorman's share interest increased by 36,137 ordinary shares 
after the delivery of the 2023 annual bonus shares and the vesting of 
the 2021 LTIP award. 
At March 8, 2024, the Directors and Senior Management (pages 139 
and 146) of the Company beneficially owned, individually and in 
aggregate (including shares under option), less than 1% of Company 
shares. These shareholdings are not considered sufficient to affect
the independence of the Directors.
Dilution
In any 10-year period, no more than 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under executive 
(discretionary) share plans adopted by the Company, or 10% when 
aggregated with awards under any other employee share plan 
operated by the Company. To date, no shareholder dilution has 
resulted from these plans, although it is permitted under the rules
of the plans, subject to these limits.
Payments for loss of office (audited)
There were no payments for loss of office to Executive Directors in 2023.
Payments to past Directors (audited)
Ben van Beurden stepped down from the Board and his role as CEO 
on December 31, 2022, and continued working as a full-time adviser to 
the Board until June 30, 2023. See the 2022 Directors' Remuneration 
Report for details of his role during 2023. As disclosed in last year's 
report, Ben van Beurden did not receive an LTIP award in 2023. 
His remuneration in respect of 2023 is set out below:
￮ Base salary: £710,000.
￮ Pension: pension cash allowance of 20% of salary.
￮ Annual bonus: £1,210,000 (determined based on Shell's 
performance as at Q2 2023).
￮ LTIP: Ben van Beurden received an LTIP award of 231,679 ordinary 
shares in 2021 (worth around 265% of salary), which has been pro-
rated. The pro-rated award vested at 94% of target based on 
performance to December 31, 2023. Therefore, 204,589 ordinary 
shares (including accrued dividends) vested on March 7, 2024, with 
a value at vesting of €5,988,311 (equivalent to £5,123,469). A 
three-year holding period applies, which remains in force after 
termination.
￮ Benefits: £270,681, including relocation-related costs (£200,051), 
car allowance (£14,945), and grossing costs (£51,031).
￮ Loss of office: £1,420,000, equivalent to one times base salary. This 
was paid in six equal monthly instalments between July 1, 2023 and 
December 31, 2023, which would have been subject to mitigation 
in the event that he resumed a paid position in that time.
Former CFO Jessica Uhl received an LTIP award of 69,972 ADS in 
2021 (worth around 248% of salary), which has been pro-rated. The 
pro-rated award vested at 94% of target based on performance to

TSR performance and CEO pay
Performance graph
The graph below compares the TSR performance of Shell plc over 
the past 10 financial years with that of the FTSE 100 Index. The Board 
regards this index as the most appropriate broad market equity index 
for comparison, following the move of Shell's headquarters to the UK. 
Data shown is for the performance of RDS B shares prior to the 
assimilation of Shell's shares into a single line of ordinary shares 
on January 29, 2022.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Directors and employees
The table below compares the remuneration of the Executive and Non-executive Directors of Shell plc with an employee comparator group 
consisting of local employees in the UK, the USA, and the Netherlands. The local employee population of these countries is considered to be a 
suitable employee comparator group because: these are countries with a significant Shell employee base; a large proportion of senior managers 
come from these countries; and the REMCO considers remuneration levels in these countries when setting base salaries for Executive Directors. For 
the purposes of comparison, the change in employee remuneration is calculated by reference to the change in salary scale, benefits and annual 
bonus for a notional employee in each of the base countries, not by reference to the actual change in pay for a group of employees.
Taxable benefits are those that align with the definition of taxable benefits applying in the respective country. In line with the "Single figure of total 
remuneration for Executive Directors" table, the annual bonus is included in the year in which it was earned (rather than paid).

Shell has chosen to use option A (as defined in UK reporting 
regulations) to calculate the CEO pay ratio in accordance with 
guidance from the UK government that this is the preferred approach 
and the most statistically accurate method for identifying the ratios. 
Under option A, a comparable single figure for all UK employees 
has been calculated in order to identify the employees whose pay 
and benefits are at the 25
th
, 50
th
 (median) and 75
th
 percentiles for 
comparison with the CEO. Employee pay has been calculated based 
on the total pay and benefits paid in respect of 2023 for all employees 
who were employed on December 31, 2023. For part-time workers and 
joiners in the year, pay and benefits have been annualised based on 
the proportion of their working time in the UK during the year. This is 
calculated with an approach consistent with the methodology for 
determining annual bonuses. The REMCO believes that this provides 
a fair and reasonable calculation of the pay ratios for Shell employees 
in the UK.
The ratio of the CEO's pay to the median UK employee is 58. The 
global pay ratio, calculated by comparing the CEO's single figure 
with the average employee headcount cost, is 78. The ratio at median 
for 2023 is lower than for 2022, reflecting a lower aggregate variable 
pay outcome for the new CEO in 2023 as compared with the previous 
CEO in 2022, and specifically, reflecting that his LTIP was granted prior 
to his appointment to the CEO role. Overall, the pay ratios are lower 
than in 2018 (the first year of reporting), reflecting reductions in the 
CEO bonus and LTIP opportunities over time, as well as changes in 
variable pay outcomes. The REMCO believes the CEO pay ratio for 
2023 is appropriate and consistent with Shell's philosophy of pay 
for performance.
Directors' employment arrangements and letters 
of appointment
Executive Directors are employed for an indefinite period. Non-
executive Directors, including the Chair, have letters of appointment. 
Details of Executive Directors' employment arrangements can be 
found in the Policy on page 199.
 
Further details of Non-executive Directors' terms of appointment can be found in the 
"Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 205 and the "Governance 
framework" report on page 149.
Compensation of Directors and Senior Management
During the year ended December 31, 2023, Shell paid and/or accrued 
compensation totalling $57 million (2022: $53 million) to Directors 
and Senior Management for services in all capacities while serving 
as a Director or member of Senior Management, including $2 million 
(2022: $2 million) accrued to provide pension, retirement and similar 
benefits. The amounts stated are those recognised in Shell's income 
attributable to Shell plc shareholders on an IFRS basis. See Note 33 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". Personal loans or 
guarantees were not provided to Directors or Senior Management.
Workforce engagement on remuneration matters
Workforce engagement
Our employees are fundamental to our success. Fostering a 
collaborative culture and reinforcing a learner mindset is central to 
delivering Powering Progress. The Board's view is that all Directors 
have a collective responsibility for workforce engagement, ensuring 
that employees' voices are heard on all business matters, including 
pay, and that the Company communicates effectively to employees 
on our remuneration policies and practices.
The Board and management regularly engage with the workforce 
through a range of formal and informal channels. These include 
webcasts and all-employee messages from our CEO and other senior 
leaders; town halls and team meetings; virtual coffee connects; 
interviews with senior management; internal social platforms; and 
focused engagements. During interactive sessions, employees have 
the opportunity to ask about any topic, including pay. The Board's 
preference is to build on existing, long-standing channels of 
engagement for discussions around remuneration. During the 
year, management engaged with the workforce on what the 
2023 performance metrics meant for each of us, giving 
employees the opportunity to ask any questions on this topic. 
We conduct annual employee surveys, which receive high levels of 
response (88% in 2023, an all-time high). The Board was pleased to 
note strong results for the 2023 Shell People Survey, maintaining the 
outcomes for 2022 in a number of engagement-related categories.

These are very encouraging results and are testament to Shell's 
strength, maturity, and resilience.
Wider employee context
The REMCO receives annual updates on workforce remuneration 
topics, including employees' views on pay matters; CEO pay ratio; 
workforce reward philosophy and principles; alignment of Shell values 
and behaviours with remuneration practices; and general employee 
salary planning and variable pay outcomes, taking account of the cost 
of living environment and the impact of this on our colleagues. The 
REMCO is also periodically updated on wider employee matters such 
as the UK gender and ethnicity pay gap analyses. In this way, the 
REMCO is able to satisfy itself that reward across Shell is aligned 
to our strategy, culture, and long-term sustainable success.
Shell adheres to its fair pay principles in all remuneration-related 
matters. Pay in Shell is market-competitive, free from bias, and provides 
security to our employees. Shell sets clear performance expectations, 
gives employees the opportunity to share in Shell's success through a 
variety of variable pay schemes, and is transparent and clear in its 
communication of remuneration. For more information, visit the 
"Human Rights" section of shell.com.
How executive remuneration aligns with wider Company pay policy
Executive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with the structures for the broader workforce, as set out in the table below.
 
Element Comparison of Executive Director and wider workforce arrangements
Salary The Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed with reference to the factors set out in the Policy, against defined comparator groups. The market-
competitiveness of wider workforce salaries is assessed at a base country level.
Pension and 
benefits
The Executive Directors' pension benefits are aligned with those offered to employees who joined Shell from 2013 onwards in the UK. Shell does not 
operate separate executive pension arrangements. All Group employees participate in the relevant pension plan for their base country based on their 
date of joining.
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive the same benefits available to the broader workforce.
Annual
bonus
The Group scorecard applicable to Group employees is identical to that applicable to Executive Directors in terms of performance measures, 
weightings, and targets. For the wider workforce, an additional multiplier applies based on individual performance during the year. No individual 
multiplier applies to Executive Directors, and further, 50% of the bonus is paid in shares, and the bonus is subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Long-term 
incentives
Executive Directors and around 130 senior executives participate in the LTIP on the same terms. Executive Directors' LTIP awards are subject to a three-
year holding period. A further c.17,800 employees participate in the PSP; 50% of the performance conditions are the same as those for the LTIP.
Shareholding 
guidelines
The Executive Directors have the highest shareholding guidelines in the Company, which are set at 700% and 500% of salary for the CEO and the 
CFO, respectively. These guidelines continue post termination for a period of two years.
Shareholding guidelines extend into the organisation to senior manager level. Employees are required to achieve their individual guideline within a 
specified timeframe, as is the case for Executive Directors.
Statement of planned implementation of Policy in 2024
A summary of how the shareholder-approved Policy will be applied to 
Directors' remuneration for 2024 is set out below.
Executive Directors
Comparator group
The benchmarking comparator group for 2024 remains consistent with 
that used in prior years, and consists of other oil majors (BP, Chevron, 
ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies) and a selection of major Europe-based 
companies. The oil majors are included in the comparator group as 
these represent our closest direct competitors operating in similar 
market conditions. The Europe-based companies are selected based 
on their size, complexity and global reach. The REMCO retains the 
right to alter the comparator group as it sees fit to ensure it remains 
an appropriate and relevant benchmark.
The REMCO uses benchmark data from these companies only 
as a guide to the competitiveness of the remuneration packages. 
The REMCO does not seek to position remuneration at any 
defined point against the comparator data.
 European comparator group
 
Allianz Glencore Rio Tinto
AstraZeneca GSK Roche
BAT Mercedes-Benz Siemens
Bayer Nestle Unilever
Diageo Novartis Vodafone
Salaries
Effective January 1, 2024, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received 
an increase of 3.9%, and salaries for 2024 are £1,455,000 and 
£961,000, respectively.
In reviewing the Executive Directors' salaries, the REMCO carefully 
considered the external environment, and the increases provided to the 
Shell workforce in the key markets of the UK (4.5%), the USA (3.1%), 
and the Netherlands (4.3%). The Executive Directors' increases for 
2024 were positioned below other UK employees and in line with 
the average across the key markets and the REMCO recognised 
the "multiplier effect on total remuneration".
Annual bonus
The REMCO reviewed the bonus scorecard during the year and 
considered that it remained well aligned with our strategic and operational 
priorities. Shell’s energy transition plans cover all its businesses, and the 
REMCO updated the annual bonus scorecard accordingly. It determined 
to introduce a measure focussing on the operational performance of the 
LNG business, alongside existing metrics of operational emissions 
reduction and electric vehicle charge points. The 2023 scorecard had 
two Downstream metrics, being electric vehicle charge points and "selling 
lower-carbon products". Electric vehicle charge points has been retained 
as the Downstream metric, aligning to become a global leader in public 
charging for electric vehicles. The performance measures, weightings and 
link to strategy for the 2024 performance year are set out overleaf. See 
the Chair's Statement for further details of changes in light of ETS24.
In the interest of simplification and alignment of the two Executive 
Directors in delivering the operating plan (the primary focus of the annual 
bonus), the CFO's target bonus will be aligned to that of the CEO from 
2024, and will be 125% of salary (and maximum bonus will be 250% 
of salary). There is no change to the shareholder-approved Policy.

Long-term Incentive Plan
On February 2, 2024, a conditional award of performance shares 
under the LTIP was made to the Executive Directors resulting in 
169,937 Shell plc shares being awarded to Wael Sawan and 101,051 
to Sinead Gorman. The awards had a face value of 300% (maximum 
performance outcome 600%) of salary for Wael Sawan and 270% 
(maximum performance outcome 540%) of salary for Sinead Gorman, 
excluding potential share price appreciation and dividends. 2024 LTIP 
awards to Executive Directors are based on salaries as at December 31 
the prior year, consistent with the rest of the organisation. 
The REMCO reviewed the award levels in the context of share price 
movement over the year prior to award, and determined that the risk 
of windfall gain was limited and therefore no adjustment was made.
Performance is measured over the three-year period January 1, 2024 
to December 31, 2026. The performance measures, weightings and 
link to strategy for the 2024 award are set out below. The REMCO 
reviewed the LTIP performance conditions and adjusted the metrics 
under the "Shell's journey in the energy transition" performance 
condition in light of ETS24.
 
2024 LTIP performance conditions, weightings, 
and link to strategy
Performance framework for 2024 LTIP "Shell's journey in the 
energy transition" performance condition
Shell was the first major energy company to introduce a dedicated 
energy transition performance condition to its LTIP in 2019. One of the 
REMCO's key learnings since then has been the need for agility and 
the importance of a holistic assessment of the achievement of strategic 
intent. This approach will continue in 2024, and the REMCO will 
provide a full disclosure of all material factors, both quantitative and 
qualitative, that it took into account in reaching the vesting decision.
The REMCO's determination of the extent to which awards will vest 
will be based on its holistic assessment of progress towards reducing 
emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to 
reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero 
climate targets for our own operations of:
￮ Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control 
on a net basis (2016 baseline); 
￮ Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; 
and 
￮ Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving 
near-zero methane emissions by 2030. 
[A] Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.

The REMCO will also take account of progress in developments 
that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the 
development of our Power business (including renewables), lower-
carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and CCS. 
We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% 
reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline), a 15-20% reduction in 
customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 
baseline) [A], as well as Shell's wider performance in accelerating 
the energy transition, e.g. demonstrating leadership and advocacy 
in standard setting, alongside any other factors that the REMCO 
considers relevant.
[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) 
were 517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
Pension
Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman are eligible to participate in 
the defined contribution UK Shell Pension Plan with an employer 
contribution rate of up to 20% of salary, or take this as a pension 
cash alternative. The UK Shell Pension Plan or associated pension 
cash alternative is available to Shell employees in the UK who 
joined Shell from 2013 onwards at the same contribution levels.
Benefits 
Executive Directors are provided with a chauffeured car for business 
travel, including home-to-office commuting. Other benefits, such as

receive any additional fee for chairing the Nomination and Succession 
Committee or attending any other Board Committee meeting.
The Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee. There are additional 
fees for the Senior Independent Director, a Board Committee chair or 
a Board Committee member, and for most Board meetings involving 
intercontinental travel. Business expenses (including transport between 
home and office and occasional business-required partner travel) 
and associated tax are paid or reimbursed by Shell. 
The Board reviews Non-executive Directors' fees periodically to ensure 
that they are aligned with those of other major listed companies. 
During these reviews the Board considers fees in the top 30 companies 
within the FTSE100 Index and the European comparator group as its 
primary points of reference. For 2024, fees for the Audit and Risk 
Committee Chair and Members increase to £55,000 (from £53,000) 
and £25,000 (from £22,000), respectively, and the REMCO Chair 
fee increases to £42,000 (from £36,000). These fee increases take 
into account market fee levels. All other fees remain unchanged.

Meeting (AGM), came into effect from May 23, 2023, and will 
be effective until the 2026 AGM, unless a revised Policy is proposed 
by the Company and approved by shareholders in the meantime.
The principles underpinning the REMCO's approach to executive 
remuneration are the foundation for everything we do and are:
￮ Alignment with Shell's strategy and sustainability: the Executive 
Directors' compensation package should promote the long-term, 
sustainable success of Shell, and be strongly linked to the 
achievement of stretching targets that are indicators of the
execution of Shell's strategy; 
￮ Pay for performance: the majority of the Executive Directors' 
compensation, (excluding benefits and pensions), should be linked 
directly to Shell's performance through variable pay instruments; 
￮ Competitiveness: remuneration levels should be determined by 
reference internally against Shell's Senior Management and 
externally against companies of comparable size, complexity
and global scope; 
￮ Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should 
align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares
in Shell;
￮ Consistency: the remuneration structure for Executive Directors 
should generally be consistent with the remuneration structure for 
Shell's Senior Management. This consistency builds a culture of 
alignment with Shell's purpose and a common approach to sharing 
in Shell's success; and
￮ Risk assessment: decisions should be made in the context of the Shell 
General Business Principles and Code of Conduct. The remuneration 
structures and rewards should meet risk assessment tests to ensure 
that shareholders' interests are safeguarded and that inappropriate 
actions are avoided.
The Executive Directors' remuneration structure is made up of a fixed 
element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus 
(50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Variable pay outcomes are conditional on the successful execution of 
the operating plan in the short term, and the delivery of strategic goals 
and financial and share price outperformance over the longer term.
The award of shares under the bonus and LTIP, along with significant 
shareholding requirements, are intended to ensure executives have a 
sizeable shareholding in the Company and experience the same 
outcomes as our shareholders.
During 2022, the REMCO reviewed the Policy to ensure that it 
continued to support Shell's strategy. The REMCO determined that 
the 2020 Policy remained appropriate in most respects, and required 
changes only to reflect the transition of our Executive Directors to the 
UK to align with market practice and for simplification. For each area 
of the Policy, the REMCO reviewed the alignment with strategy, market 
practice, the corporate governance environment, and feedback from 
shareholders, and additionally spent time updating the selection 
and calibration of performance metrics in variable pay schemes. Any 
potential conflict of interest was mitigated by the independence of the 
REMCO members and the REMCO Terms of Reference. The REMCO 
also considered the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
when reviewing the Policy, and sought to reflect the principles of clarity, 
simplicity, risk management, predictability, proportionality and 
alignment with culture.
A comparison of the 2023 and 2020 Policies is set out below.

Purpose and link to strategy Maximum opportunity Operation and performance measurement
Base salary
Provides a fixed level of earnings to 
attract and retain Executive 
Directors.
£2,000,000 Reviewed annually with adjustments effective from January 1.
In making salary determinations, the REMCO will consider:
￮ the market positioning of the compensation packages;
￮ comparison with Senior Management salaries; 
￮ the employee context, and planned average salary increase for other employees 
across the UK, the Netherlands, and the USA;
￮ the experience, skills and performance of the Executive Director, or any change in the 
scope and responsibility of their role;
￮ general economic conditions, Shell's financial performance, and governance trends; 
and
￮ the impact of salary increases on pension benefits and other elements of the package.
Benefits
Provides benefits, typically in line 
with those applicable to the wider 
workforce, in order to attract and 
retain Executive Directors.
Determined by the nature of the 
benefit itself and costs of provision, 
and may depend on external 
factors, e.g. insurance costs.
Typical benefits include car allowances, home-to-office transport, risk benefits (for 
example ill health, disability or death-in-service), security provision, and employer 
contributions to insurance plans (such as medical) including Directors' liability insurance. 
In the event an international relocation is required either prior to appointment or while 
appointed, Shell's mobility policies may apply and the REMCO may offer appropriate 
provisions in respect of items including, but not limited to, relocation, assistance with 
visa/immigration/tax issues, and tax return support. It may also provide housing and 
education assistance for a specified period of time, expected to be no more than two 
years. Tax equalisation related to expatriate employment prior to Board appointment, 
or in other limited circumstances to offset double taxation, may also be provided.
Precise benefits will depend on the Executive Director's specific circumstances and may 
include any tax liabilities relating to business-related benefits such as in the case of 
security or relocation provisions. 
The REMCO may adjust the range and scope of the benefits offered in the context of 
developments for other employees in the country which the Executive Director is based. 
Personal loans or guarantees are not provided to Executive Directors.
Pension
Provides a competitive defined 
contribution pension provision 
applicable to the wider workforce 
in the UK to attract and retain 
Executive Directors.
Determined by the rules of the 
defined contribution UK pension 
arrangements.
Executive Directors' retirement benefits are maintained in line with those of the wider 
Shell workforce in the UK. Only base salary is pensionable, unless plan regulations 
specify otherwise and cannot legally be disapplied. The rules of the relevant plan detail 
the pension benefits which members can receive. The REMCO retains the right to amend 
the form of any Executive Director's pension arrangements where appropriate, for 
example in response to changes in legislation to ensure the original objective of this 
element of remuneration is preserved.
New Executive Directors based in the UK, whether internal appointees or external hires, 
will be provided with the defined contribution arrangement, applicable to the wider Shell 
workforce in the UK, which currently includes the flexibility to take this as a pension cash 
alternative.
Annual bonus
Rewards the delivery of short-term 
operational targets as derived from 
Shell's operating plan.
Aligns the interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders, and 
supports retention, through long-
term holding in shares.
Target bonus: 125% of 
base salary.
Maximum bonus: 200% 
of target.
￮ The bonus is determined by reference to performance from January 1 to December 31 
each year.
￮ Annual bonus = base salary x target bonus % x scorecard result (0–2).
￮ The scorecard is reviewed each year, taking account of Shell's operating plan, to 
ensure that the performance measures, targets and weightings are appropriate. 
Performance measures typically relate to financial delivery, operational excellence, 
progress in the energy transition, and safety, with indicative weightings of 35%, 35%, 
15% and 15% respectively. This helps to balance short-term financial performance with 
the achievement of a broader set of strategic and operational objectives to support 
long-term shareholder value creation. The REMCO retains the flexibility to adjust 
performance measures, weightings and targets on a year-by-year basis, within the 
terms of the Policy.
￮ Scorecard targets are disclosed on a retrospective basis in a subsequent Annual 
Report on Remuneration, when they are no longer deemed commercially sensitive.
￮ To reinforce alignment with shareholder interests, 50% of any bonus earned is 
delivered in cash and 50% is delivered in net-of-tax shares. The shares are subject to 
a three-year holding period from the end of the performance period the award relates 
to, which applies beyond an Executive Director's tenure. The REMCO retains 
discretion to waive any part of this holding period in exceptional circumstances 
(primarily death).
￮ The bonus is subject to malus provisions before it is delivered, and to clawback 
thereafter for a period of three years.

Target award: 300% of base salary. 
Awards may vest at up to 200% of 
the shares originally awarded, plus 
dividends.
￮ Award levels are determined in respect of any financial year by the REMCO 
within the Policy maximum.
￮ Awards may vest at between 0% and 200% of the initial award, depending 
on Shell's performance, assessed over a three-year performance period, 
on an absolute basis and/or on a relative basis against an appropriate 
comparator group.
￮ Performance measures and weightings are reviewed and set by the REMCO at 
the beginning of each three-year performance period, taking account of Shell's 
strategic priorities. 
￮ Notional dividends accrue over the vesting period in respect of awards that vest.
￮ To reinforce alignment with shareholder interests, net of tax shares delivered from 
vested awards are subject to a three-year holding period from the end of the 
performance period the award relates to, which applies beyond an Executive 
Director's tenure. The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of this holding 
period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).
￮ Dividends accrue over the vesting period in respect of awards that vest.
￮ The award is subject to malus provisions before vesting, and to clawback 
provisions thereafter for a period of three years.
Discretion, malus and clawback
Enables the management of risks 
from behaviour-based incentive 
schemes and the REMCO to manage 
the range of pay outcomes.
Adjustment events exist for the 
purposes of applying malus and 
clawback.
The REMCO retains discretion 
to adjust pay outcomes.
￮ The REMCO retains the discretion to adjust mathematical outcomes of the annual 
bonus scorecard and/or LTIP vesting for any Executive Director if and to the 
extent that it considers this appropriate at their sole discretion.
￮ The REMCO may adjust pay outcomes for the purposes of managing quantum. 
This would be done at the REMCO's discretion after considering single figure 
outcome for the year, taking into account Shell's performance, the operation 
of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations.
￮ In exceptional circumstances, the REMCO may determine that the vesting of 
an annual bonus or a share award should be suspended pending the outcome 
of an investigation. The suspension may be for such period as the REMCO 
considers sufficient to permit the investigation to be concluded.
￮ The use of any discretion will be disclosed and explained.
Shareholding requirements
Aligns interests of Executive Directors 
with those of shareholders by 
creating a connection between 
individual wealth and Shell's long-
term performance.
Shareholding (% of base salary):
￮ CEO: 700%
￮ CFO: 500%
￮ Executive Directors are expected to build up their shareholding to the required 
level over a period of five years from appointment and, once reached, to 
maintain this level for the full period of their appointment. The intention is for the 
shareholding guideline to be reached through retention of vested shares from 
share plans. The REMCO will monitor progress and retains the ability to adjust 
the guideline in special circumstances on an individual basis.
￮ In the event of an increase to the guideline, this timeframe is increased by one 
year for every additional multiple of salary required, subject to a maximum of 
five years from the date of the change. 
￮ The Executive Director will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement 
(or existing shareholding if lower) for a period of two years from the date they 
cease to be an employee. Post-termination holding is enforced through the 
arrangements put in place with the employee on termination.
￮ In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the REMCO will 
determine their shareholding requirement level, which will not be less than 200% 
of salary, in line with corporate governance best practice.
￮ Vested shares from incentive plans (including bonus and LTIP shares subject to 
holding period) count towards the requirement. The REMCO monitors individual 
progress and retains the ability to adjust the guideline in special circumstances 
on an individual basis.

Notes to the Policy table
Executive Directors outside of the UK
In respect of salary, benefits and pension, in the event that an Executive 
Director is based outside of the UK, the REMCO reserves the right to 
determine the individual's remuneration arrangements in line with their 
base or host country, within the spirit of the Policy.
Payments from previously agreed remuneration arrangements
The REMCO reserves the right to make any remuneration payments 
where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the Policy
came into effect, or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was
not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the REMCO,
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming
a Director of the Company. The REMCO also reserves the right to
honour pre-existing contractual obligations in accordance with the 
terms of the service contract and relevant incentive plan. Details
of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.
Selection of performance measures
For the 2023 performance year, the annual bonus scorecard will 
consist of financial delivery (35%), operational excellence (35%), 
progress in the energy transition (15%), and safety (15%). Targets are 
derived from the annual business plan. These measures are designed 
to drive focus on the financial and operational performance critical to 
our success in delivering our Powering Progress strategy. The REMCO 
believes it is important for annual variable pay to remain balanced, 
with short-term operational components complementing the LTIP's 
focus on longer-term financial and strategic outcomes. The same 
annual bonus scorecard applies to the majority of Group employees, 
supporting consistency of remuneration and alignment of objectives 
across employees and senior management.
For 2023 LTIP awards, performance will be assessed based on 75% 
financial metrics (relative CFFO divided by average capital employed, 
relative TSR, absolute OFCF, equally weighted) and 25% on a strategic 
measure focused on Shell's journey in the energy transition. These 
metrics are designed to support our strategic ambition of accelerating 
our transition to be a net-zero emissions business while creating value 
for our shareholders.
For the relative measures, 200% vests for first position, 150% 
for second, 80% for third, and 0% for ranking fourth or fifth. The 
comparator group consists of four of the strongest companies in our 
industry (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies). Outperforming 
Shell's closest competitors on key financial metrics is challenging. 
A vesting outcome of 80% of target (40% of maximum) for median 
performance in a small comparator group is considered appropriate 
by the REMCO. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median 
performance is generally set at a limit of 25% of maximum for other 
UK companies. However, these are typically applied against a larger 
comparator group.
To simplify the plan and align with market practice, the TSR underpin 
has been removed from the plan effective from 2024 awards.
Discretion
There are a number of specific areas in which the REMCO may 
exercise discretion, including: 
￮ To review the specific measures, weightings and targets for the 
annual bonus scorecard and LTIP award annually and adjust 
accordingly to evolve with Shell's strategy and circumstances to 
ensure that the targets remain stretching but realistic. If the REMCO 
were to propose any material changes to the LTIP performance 
metrics, it would consult with major shareholders; and
￮ To adjust mathematical variable pay outcomes if and to the extent 
that it considers this appropriate. This power to adjust the outcomes 
is broad and includes adjusting the outcomes to zero. For example, 
an adjustment might be made if the REMCO considers:
– The mathematical outcomes do not reflect the wider financial 
or non-financial performance of the Company or the participant 
over the performance period;
– The LTIP vesting percentage is not appropriate in the context of 
circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at award; and 
– There is any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate. 
It is not anticipated that discretion would be used for upwards 
adjustment. If, in exceptional circumstances, it was considered, this 
would be done only after consultation with major shareholders.
Performance outcomes and/or share price movements make it difficult 
to predict the final amounts delivered under the LTIP at the time of 
award. Each year, the REMCO reviews the LTIP vesting values and 
single figure outcomes for the Executive Directors to ensure that they 
are appropriate. The REMCO will review the formulaic single figure 
outcomes relative to the quality of performance outcomes and adjust 
these, taking into account Shell's performance, shareholder experience, 
the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant 
factors to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only 
achieved in years with the highest quality performance. In years where 
the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration inappropriate for 
any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to 
the annual bonus outcome and/or the LTIP vesting outcome for the 
purposes of managing remuneration quantum. In making any 
adjustment to the annual bonus and/or LTIP vesting outcome for this 
purpose, REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the 
Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of 
the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, 
as well as the internal context for other employees. An explanation of 
any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant year's 
Directors' Remuneration Report.
Malus and clawback
Variable pay awards may be made subject to adjustment events. 
At the discretion of the REMCO, such an award may be adjusted 
before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if an 
adjustment event occurs.
Adjustment events will be specified in award documentation and it is 
intended that they will, for example, relate to restatement of financial 
statements due to material non-compliance with a financial reporting 
requirement; misconduct by an Executive Director or misconduct 
through their direction or non-direction; any material breach of health 
and safety or environment regulations; serious reputational damage 
to Shell; material failure of risk management; corporate failure; or other 
exceptional events as determined at the discretion of the REMCO. The 
REMCO retains the right to alter the list of adjustment events in respect 
of future awards.

Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors from that for other employees
The remuneration policies, structure, and approach to setting 
remuneration levels are consistent across organisational levels at Shell, 
with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities. 
A higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for 
Executive Directors and members of Senior Management, to reflect 
these individuals' positions of influence and accountability.
 
Detailed discussion of how executive remuneration aligns with wider Company pay policy 
may be found in the "Workforce engagement on remuneration matters" section of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 190.
Illustration of potential remuneration outcomes 
The charts on this page illustrate the potential future value and 
composition of the Executive Directors' total remuneration opportunities 
under four performance scenarios ("Minimum", "On-target", "Maximum" 
and "Maximum +50% share price appreciation between award and 
vest"). The remuneration opportunities are based on those set out in 
the Policy table, applied to 2023 base salaries. The majority of the 
Executive Directors' remuneration is delivered through variable pay 
elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets.
For simplicity, the charts exclude dividend accrual, and exclude 
the effect of any Company share price movement except in the 
"Maximum +50%" scenario.

Recruitment
The REMCO determines the remuneration package for new Executive 
Director appointments. These appointments may involve external 
or internal recruitment, or reflect a change in role of a current 
Executive Director.
When determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, 
the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to:
￮ Attract and motivate candidates of the right quality;
￮ Take into account the individual's current remuneration package
and other contractual entitlements;
￮ Seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, 
without overpaying;
￮ Encourage relocation if required; and
￮ Honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal 
candidates before their promotion to the Board, with the exception 
of any previous pension arrangements. 
The REMCO will follow the approach set out below when determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director.
Ongoing 
remuneration
The salary, benefits, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension benefits will be positioned and 
delivered within the framework of the Policy.
As stated in the Executive Directors' 
Remuneration Policy table, and 
notes to the table.
Compensation for 
the forfeiture of any 
awards under 
variable 
remuneration 
arrangements
To facilitate external recruitment, one-off compensation in consideration for forfeited awards under 
variable remuneration arrangements entered into with a previous employer may be required. The 
REMCO will use its judgement to determine the appropriate level of compensation by matching the 
value of any lost awards under variable remuneration arrangements with the candidate's previous 
employer. This compensation may take the form of a one-off cash payment or an additional award 
under the LTIP. The compensation can alternatively be based on a newly created long-term incentive 
plan arrangement where the only participant is the new Director. The intention is that any such 
compensation would, as far as possible, align to the duration and structure of the award being 
forfeited. Where appropriate, performance conditions, holding periods, and malus and clawback 
provisions will apply.
An amount equal to the value of 
the forfeited variable remuneration 
awards, as assessed by the 
REMCO. Consideration will be 
given to appropriate performance 
conditions, performance periods 
and clawback arrangements.

Replacement of 
forfeited entitlements 
other than any 
awards under 
variable 
remuneration 
arrangements
There may also be a need to compensate a new Executive Director in respect of forfeited 
entitlements other than any awards under variable remuneration arrangements. This could include, 
for example, contractual entitlements or other benefits. On recruitment, these entitlements may be 
replicated within the Executive Director's remuneration package or valued by the REMCO and 
compensated in cash.
In cases of internal promotion to the Board, any commitments made which cannot be effectively 
replaced within the Executive Director's remuneration package may, at the REMCO's discretion, 
continue to be honoured.
An amount equal to the value of 
the forfeited entitlements, as 
assessed by the REMCO.
Exceptional 
recruitment incentive
Apart from the ongoing annual remuneration package and any compensation in respect of the 
replacement of forfeited entitlements, there may be circumstances in which the REMCO needs to 
offer a one-off recruitment incentive in the form of cash or shares to ensure the right external 
candidate is attracted (e.g. to the industry). The REMCO recognises the importance of internal 
succession planning but it must also have the ability to compete for talent with other global 
companies. The necessity and level of this incentive will depend on the individual's circumstances. 
The intention will be that this is only used in genuinely exceptional circumstances. 
A one-off amount up to the limits set 
out in the Executive Directors' 
Remuneration Policy table, in 
addition to the ongoing package.
Relocation In the event that an internal or external candidate were required to relocate internationally to take 
up the Executive Director position, the REMCO may offer appropriate relocation provisions in 
respect of items including, but not limited to, relocation, assistance with visa/immigration issues, 
housing, and education assistance. If provided, these will be for a specified period of time, expected 
to be no more than two years.
The level of such benefits would be 
set at an appropriate level by the 
REMCO, taking into account the 
circumstances, provisions 
applicable to the wider 
internationally mobile workforce, 
and typical market practice.
Component Approach Maximum
 Executive Directors' service contracts and end of employment arrangements (including change of control provisions)
Service contracts Executive Directors are employed for an indefinite period. Executive Directors based in the UK will be employed on service contracts 
governed by the laws of England and Wales.
Notice period The Executive Director or the Company may terminate employment by giving 12 months' written notice. The Company may require the 
Executive Director to be on garden leave during all or any of the notice period (whether notice is given by the Company or the Executive 
Director).
Payment in lieu of 
notice (PILON)
The Company may terminate an Executive Director's service contract at any time with immediate effect and pay a sum in lieu of the 
unexpired portion of any notice period to the value of no more than 12 months' fixed pay (salary and regular allowances) and other 
benefits (unless statutory requirements to pay additional sums apply). 
The Company has the contractual right to make any PILON in monthly instalments in its discretion. Once the right to make a PILON is 
exercised, its delivery in instalments is mitigated by a contractual obligation on the Executive Director to seek alternative employment. 
Compensation for 
loss of office
Executive Directors will not usually receive additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as 
described above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director's employment in breach of contract 
(taking into account, as appropriate, the Executive Director's responsibility to mitigate any losses).
The REMCO reserves the right to make payments it considers reasonable in settlement of potential legal claims taking into account 
contractual provisions, applicable law, corporate governance provisions, the applicability of any statutory compensation and the best 
interests of Shell and shareholders as a whole.
Dismissal The Company may terminate employment immediately in particular defined circumstances such as gross misconduct, with no further payment 
or PILON.
Annual bonus 
accrued prior to 
termination
The following provisions will normally apply:
￮ In the event of death, disability, injury or ill health, retirement, redundancy, completion of a fixed-term contract, and other circumstances 
at the REMCO's discretion, any annual bonus in the year of departure is pro-rated based on service. Depending on the timing of the 
departure, the REMCO may consider the latest scorecard position or defer payment until the full-year scorecard result is known.
￮ In the event of a change of control, the REMCO will assess the most appropriate treatment for the outstanding bonus period according 
to the circumstances.
￮ Bonuses delivered in shares represent the bonus which a participant has already earned, and carry no further performance conditions. 
Therefore, these shares will normally be unrestricted at the conclusion of the normal holding period otherwise, and no pro-ration will apply.
￮ In other circumstances (including resignation), no award will be made unless statutory requirements apply.
￮ The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of a bonus holding period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).

LTIP awards Share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. The following provisions will normally apply:
￮ In the event of disability, injury or ill health, retirement, redundancy, completion of a fixed-term contract, and other circumstances at the 
REMCO's discretion: outstanding awards are reduced pro-rata (on a monthly basis) for time elapsed during the performance period. They 
will generally survive the end of employment and remain subject to the same vesting performance conditions, holding period and malus 
and clawback provisions, as if the Executive Director had remained in employment. The extent to which awards vest will be determined 
by the REMCO, taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied.
￮ In the event of death: the award will vest in full on the date of death or, if there is a target level set out in the performance condition, then 
at that target level, unless the REMCO determines otherwise.
￮ Change of control: awards will be exchanged for equivalent new awards issued by the acquirer, if agreed to by the acquirer and the 
Board. If there is no agreement to exchange awards, awards will (i) vest immediately in full if there is no performance condition, or (ii) vest 
immediately to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied to the date of vesting. Such awards will be reduced pro-rata 
for time elapsed during the performance period unless agreed otherwise.
￮ Other circumstances (including resignation): awards will lapse on cessation of employment unless statutory requirements apply.
￮ The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of a holding period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).
Other The provision of end-of-employment benefits such as a contribution to the Executive Director's legal fees for the review of any settlement 
agreement, repatriation costs, and outplacement support may also be included, as deemed reasonable by the REMCO. The Executive 
Director may also remain eligible for other benefits, such as security provision or tax return preparation, in line with policies for the wider 
workforce. The Company may pay the Executive Director's tax on such benefits. 
REMCO may adjust the range and scope of the benefits offered in the context of developments for other employees in relevant countries.

 Non-executive Directors' Remuneration Policy table
 
Fee structure Approach to setting fees Other remuneration
Non-executive Directors (NEDs) receive a 
fixed annual fee for their Directorship. The 
Chair receives a Chair of the Board fee, and 
other NEDs receive a base fee for membership 
of the Board.
Additional annual fees are payable to any NED 
(other than the Chair of the Board) who serves 
as Senior Independent Director, a Board 
Committee Chair, or a Board Committee 
member. Any individual receives either a Chair 
or member fee in respect of each Committee 
they sit on. The Chair of a Committee does not 
receive both fees.
NEDs receive an additional fee for any Board 
meeting involving intercontinental travel, with 
the exception of one meeting a year held in a 
location other than London.
The Chair of the Board fee is determined by 
the REMCO. The Board determines the fees 
payable to NEDs. The maximum aggregate 
annual fees will be within the limit specified 
by the Articles of Association and in 
accordance with the NEDs' responsibilities 
and time commitments.
The Board reviews NED fees periodically 
to ensure that they are appropriate in the 
context of fee levels at other major listed 
companies.
Business expenses incurred in respect of the performance 
of their duties as a NED will be paid or reimbursed by Shell. 
Such expenses could include transport between home and 
office, and occasional business-required partner travel. NEDs 
may receive a token of recognition on retirement from the 
Board. The maximum value for this is £300. The REMCO has 
the discretion to offer other benefits as appropriate to the 
circumstances. Where business expenses or benefits create 
a personal tax liability to the NED, Shell may cover the 
associated tax. 
The Chair and other NEDs are not eligible to receive awards 
under any incentive or performance-based remuneration plans, 
and personal loans or guarantees are not granted to them.
NEDs do not accrue any retirement benefits as a result of 
their Non-executive Directorships with Shell.
NEDs are encouraged to hold Shell shares with a value 
equivalent to 100% of their annual base fee and maintain 
that holding during their tenure.

For further details on appointment and re-appointment of NEDs, see "Governance 
framework" on page 149 and "Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 205.
Non-executive Director recruitment
The remuneration package for new NEDs is determined within the 
confines of the Policy table for NED fees, and subject to the Articles 
of Association. NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or 
retention awards.
When determining the benefits for a new Chair of the Board, the 
individual circumstances of the future Chair will be taken into account.
Non-executive Director termination of office
No payments for loss of office will be made to NEDs.
Consideration of wider employee views
The REMCO takes account of the pay and employment conditions of 
the broader workforce when setting the Policy for Executive Directors.
Whilst no specific employee groups were consulted as part of the 
2023 Policy review, Shell promotes and maintains good relations with 
employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement 
programme, and operates multiple forums through which employees 
can engage on various business matters, including pay.
When determining Executive Directors' remuneration structure and 
outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant 
reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee 
remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect 
of remuneration, and average salary increases applying in the 
Netherlands, UK and the USA). During the Policy review, pay and 
employment conditions of the wider Shell employee population were 
taken into account by adhering to the same performance, rewards 
and benefits philosophy for the Executive Directors, as well as overall 
benchmarking principles. Furthermore, any potential differences from 
other employees (see "Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors from that for other employees") were taken into account when 
providing the REMCO with advice in the formation of the Policy.
The REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources 
& Corporate Officer, and the Executive Vice President Performance and 
Reward on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration matters 
extending below the Board and Executive Committee.
 
See the "Workforce engagement on remuneration matters" section in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration, on page 190, for more information on how Shell considers and engages with 
the broader workforce on remuneration matters.
Consideration of shareholder views
The REMCO engages with major shareholders regularly throughout 
the year. Such engagement allows the REMCO to hear shareholders' 
views on Shell's approach to executive remuneration, and test 
proposals when developing or evolving the Policy. In recent years, the 
REMCO has responded to shareholder views, including the approach 
to energy transition metrics in the LTIP, the quantum of executive pay 
and the broader use of discretion to manage remuneration outcomes. 
In developing the proposed Policy, the REMCO again consulted with 
shareholders and received a diverse range of views that have helped 
to determine which proposals to refine and which to discard. For 
example, as a result of shareholder feedback in the fourth quarter 
of 2022, the REMCO determined not to proceed with seeking support 
for recruitment provision that would permit an extended notice period 
on hiring. Shareholders have been helpful in emphasising the need for 
balanced metrics in the LTIP to help avoid unintended consequences as 
Shell progresses through the energy transition. In 2022, the continued 
interest in the energy transition LTIP measure directly influenced 
increased transparency in Shell's reporting on the progress of its 
energy transition journey.
It was clear to the REMCO that whilst there were inevitably contrasting 
views around the different aspects of the Policy, shareholders are 
supportive of Shell's overall approach to remuneration and the 
REMCO's careful deliberations in decision-making. The REMCO 
will continue to review the Policy regularly to ensure it continues 
to reinforce Shell's long-term strategy and closely aligns with 
shareholders' interests.
Additional Policy statement
The REMCO reserves the right to make payments outside of the Policy 
in limited, exceptional circumstances, such as for regulatory, tax or 
administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation 
or exchange controls, and only where the REMCO considers such 
payments are necessary to give effect to the intent of the Policy.

Management's evaluation of disclosure controls and 
procedures of Shell
Shell's management, including the CEO and CFO, have evaluated the 
effectiveness of Shell's disclosure controls and procedures at December 
31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that Shell's 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Management's report on internal control over 
financial reporting of Shell
Management, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Shell's 
financial reporting and the preparation of the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements".
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Shell's 
internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements" based on the Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of 
this evaluation, management concluded that, at December 31, 2023, 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the 
preparation of the "Consolidated Financial Statements" was effective.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There has not been any change in the internal control over financial 
reporting of Shell that occurred during the period covered by this 
Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially 
affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Shell. 
Material financial information of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access 
Trust is included in the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and is 
therefore subject to the same controls and procedures. 
Financial Statements, Dividends and Dividend Policy
 
The "Consolidated Statement of Income" and "Consolidated Balance Sheet" can be 
found on pages 217 and 218 respectively.
Subject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per share 
by around 4% every year. As announced as part of Capital Markets 
Day, in total, Shell targets the distribution of 30-40% of cash flow from 
operations through the cycle to shareholders. The Board may choose 
to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends 
and share buybacks.
When setting the level of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at 
a range of factors, including the macro environment, the earnings and 
cash flow of the Group, the current balance sheet, future investment, 
acquisition and divestment plans, and existing commitments.
Interim dividends are currently declared by the Board and paid on a 
quarterly basis. Shell does not currently pay a "final" dividend, which 
would need to be voted on by shareholders, requiring the introduction 
of a resolution at the AGM. This would delay the payment of the fourth 
quarter dividend (currently paid in late March) until after the AGM. 
This approach to dividend payments is not uncommon for companies 
distributing returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis.
Shell pays its dividend in USD, EUR or GBP fully electronically either 
in CREST or via interbank transfers.
The Directors have announced a fourth quarter interim dividend 
payable on March 25, 2024, to shareholders on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on February 16, 2024. The closing 
date for dividend currency elections was March 1, 2024 [A] and the 
euro and sterling equivalents announcement date was March 11, 2024.
[A] A different dividend currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares 
in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately through Euroclear 
Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either 
directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. 
Such shareholders can contact their broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial 
institution for the election deadline that applies.
Repurchases of shares
As announced as part of Capital Markets Day, Shell targets the 
distribution of 30-40% of our cash flow from operations through 
the cycle to shareholders. The Board may choose to return cash to 
shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 
For all share buyback programmes mentioned below, Shell entered into 
irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangements with a broker in order to 
reduce the issued share capital of the Company.
On October 27, 2022, under shareholder authorities granted at the 
2022 AGM, Shell announced the commencement of a $4 billion share 
buyback programme which was completed on January 27, 2023. 
On February 2, 2023, Shell announced the commencement of a share 
buyback programme of a further $4 billion which was completed 
on April 28, 2023; and on May 4, 2023, Shell announced the 
commencement of a share buyback programme of a further 
$4 billion which was completed on July 21, 2023.
At the May 23, 2023, AGM, shareholders granted the Company 
the authority to repurchase (i) up to 692 million ordinary shares "on-
market" (excluding any treasury shares), less any "off-market" purchases 
made under the authority in (ii); and (ii) up to 692 million ordinary 
shares off-market (excluding any treasury shares), less any on-market 
purchases made under the authority in (i). The authorities for both on-
market and off-market purchases will expire at the earlier of the close 
of business on August 22, 2024, and the end of the AGM of the 
Company to be held in 2024. On July 27, 2023, Shell announced 
the commencement of a $3 billion share buyback programme which 
was completed on October 27, 2023; on November 2, 2023, Shell 
announced the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback 
programme which was completed on January 26, 2024; and on 
February 1, 2024, Shell announced the commencement of a share 
buyback programme of a further $3.5 billion which is expected to be 
completed by April 26, 2024. This means that, as at close of February 
19, 2024, 465 million further shares could still be repurchased under 
the current AGM authorities.
More information, including the number and nominal value of the 
shares repurchased in 2023, can be found in Note 26 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements".
The Board continues to regard the ability to repurchase issued shares 
in suitable circumstances as an important part of Shell's financial 
management. New resolutions will be proposed at the 2024 AGM 
to renew the authority for the Company to purchase its own share 
capital, up to specified limits, for a further year. These proposals 
will be described in more detail in the 2024 Notice of Annual 
General Meeting.
Qualifying third-party indemnities
The Company has entered into a Deed of Indemnity (Deed) with 
each Director of the Company who served during the year. The terms of 
each of these Deeds are identical and they reflect the statutory provisions 
on indemnities contained in the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006). Under 
the terms of each Deed, the Company has agreed to indemnify the 
Director, to the fullest extent permitted by the CA 2006, against any loss, 
liability or damage, howsoever caused (including in respect of a Director's 
own negligence), suffered or incurred by a Director in respect of their acts 
or omissions while or in the course of acting as a Director or employee of 
the Company, any associated company or affiliate (within the meaning of 
the CA 2006). In addition, the Company shall lend funds to Directors as 
required to meet reasonable costs and expenses incurred or to be

The Company has provided both indemnities and Directors' and 
Officers' insurance to the Directors in connection with the performance 
of their responsibilities. Copies of these indemnities and the Directors' 
and Officers' insurance policies are open to inspection. A copy of the 
form of these indemnities are filed with the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

Related Party Transactions Procedures
The Audit and Risk Committee's Terms of Reference, which was 
updated in early 2022, provides that in advance of entering into any 
related party transactions, as defined under Item 7.B. of Form 20-F, the 
Audit and Risk Committee shall review, if no other independent 
committee has reviewed, all such proposed related party transactions 
for potential conflicts of interest and consistency with the interests of the 
Company and its shareholders.
Political contributions
No payments were made by Shell companies to political parties, 
organisations or their representatives during the year. Shell USA, 
Inc. administers the non-partisan Shell USA, Inc. Employees' Political 
Awareness Committee (SEPAC), a political action committee registered 
with the US Federal Election Commission. Eligible employees may 
make voluntary personal contributions to the SEPAC. All employees'

Shell General Business Principles
The Shell General Business Principles define how Shell subsidiaries 
are expected to conduct their affairs and are underpinned by the 
Shell core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. These 
principles include, among other things, Shell's commitment to support 
fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business 
and to contribute to sustainable development. They are designed to 
mitigate the risk of damage to our business reputation and to prevent 
violations of local and international legislation. They can be found at 
shell.com/sgbp. 
 
See "Risk factors" on pages 17-26.
Shell Code of Conduct
Directors, officers, employees and contract staff are required to comply 
with the Shell Code of Conduct, which instructs them on how to behave 
in line with the Shell General Business Principles. This Code clarifies 
the basic rules and standards they are expected to follow and the 
behaviour expected of them. These individuals must also complete 
mandatory Code of Conduct training.
Designated individuals are required to complete additional mandatory 
training on antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery, anti-corruption 
and anti-money laundering laws, financial crime, data protection laws 
and trade compliance requirements. 
 
See "Risk factors" on pages 17-26.
 
The Shell Code of Conduct can be found at shell.com/codeofconduct.
Code of Ethics
Executive Directors and Senior Financial Officers of Shell must also 
comply with the Code of Ethics. This Code is specifically intended 
to meet the requirements of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
It can be found at shell.com/codeofethics.
Malus and Clawback Policy
In line with SEC and NYSE requirements, the REMCO adopted a Malus 
and clawback policy for Executive Directors and other Executive 
Committee members in 2023. A copy of this policy is filed as an exhibit 
with our Form 20-F. 
Independent professional advice
All Directors may seek independent professional advice in connection 
with their role as a Director. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. The Company has provided both 
indemnities and Directors' and Officers' insurance to the Directors in 
connection with the performance of their responsibilities. Copies of 
these indemnities and the Directors' and Officers' insurance policies are 
open to inspection. A copy of the form of these indemnities has been 
previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Directors' shareholding qualification
While the Articles do not require Directors to hold shares in the 
Company, the REMCO believes that Executive Directors should align 
their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in the 
Company. The CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of seven 
times base salary over five years from appointment and the CFO is 
expected to build up a shareholding of five times base salary over the 
same period. In the event that another Executive Director joins the 
Board, the REMCO will determine their shareholding requirement, 
which will not be less than 200% of their base salary.
Executive Directors will be required to maintain their requirement 
(or existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for a period of two 
years post employment. Non-executive Directors are encouraged to 
hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their base fee and to 
maintain that holding during their tenure.
 
Information on the Directors with shares in the Company can be found in the "Directors' 
Remuneration Report" on pages 174-176.
Non-executive Director independence
The Board follows the provisions of the Code in determining Non-
executive Director independence, which states that at least half of the 
Board, excluding the Chair, should comprise Non-executive Directors 
determined by the Board to be independent. In the case of the 
Company, the Board has determined that all the Non-executive 
Directors at the end of 2023 are independent.
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and 
Compensation Committee
The NYSE listing standards require that a listed company maintain a 
nominating/corporate governance committee and a compensation 
committee, both composed entirely of independent directors and with 
certain specific responsibilities. The Company's Nomination and 
Succession Committee and Remuneration Committee both comply with 
these requirements, except that the terms of reference of the 
Nomination and Succession Committee require only a majority of the 
committee members to be independent.
Audit and Risk Committee
As required by NYSE listing standards, the Company maintains an 
Audit and Risk Committee for the purpose of assisting the Board's 
oversight of its financial statements, its internal audit function and its 
independent auditors. The Company's Audit and Risk Committee is in 
full compliance with US Exchange Act Rule 10A-3 and Section 
303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
The Company's Audit and Risk Committee is not directly responsible for 
the appointment of independent auditors. However, the Company's 
Audit and Risk Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment or reappointment of the external auditor to put to 
shareholders for approval in the Annual General Meetings. UK 
legislation provides that it is for shareholders to agree the appointment, 
reappointment and removal of the Company's independent auditors.
Shareholder approval of share-based
compensation plans
The Company complies with the Listing Rules published by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA), which require shareholder approval for the 
adoption of share-based compensation plans which are either long-
term incentive plans in which one or more Directors can participate or 
plans which involve or may involve the issue of new shares or the 
transfer of treasury shares. Under the FCA rules, such plans cannot be 
changed to the advantage of participants without shareholder 
approval, except for certain minor amendments, such as to benefit the 
administration of the plan or to take account of tax benefits. The rules 
on the requirements to seek shareholder approval for share-based 
compensation plans, including those in respect of material revisions to 
such plans, may deviate from the NYSE listing standards.
Change of control
There are no provisions in the Articles that would delay, defer or 
prevent a change of control.

NYSE Governance Standards
In accordance with the NYSE rules for foreign private issuers, the 
Company follows home-country practice in relation to corporate 
governance. However, foreign private issuers are required to have an 
audit committee that satisfies the requirements of the US Exchange Act 
Rule 10A-3. The Company's Audit and Risk Committee satisfies such 
requirements. The NYSE also requires a foreign private issuer to 
provide certain written affirmations and notices to the NYSE, as well as 
a summary of the significant ways in which its corporate governance 
practices differ from those followed by domestic US companies under 
NYSE listing standards (see Section 303A.11 of the NYSE Listed 
Company Manual). The Company's summary of its corporate 
governance differences is given below and can be found at

Appointment and retirement of Directors
The Company's Articles, the Corporate Governance Code and the 
Companies Act 2006 govern the appointment and retirement of 
Directors. Board membership and biographical details of the Directors 
are provided on pages 139-145. However, Directors follow the 
direction laid out in the Code and stand for re-election annually. 
On March 2, 2023, Cyrus Taraporevala joined the Board as a
Non-executive Director. 
On March 13, 2023, Sir Charles Roxburgh and Leena Srivastava 
joined the Board as Non-executive Directors. 
On May 23, 2023, at the conclusion of the AGM, both Euleen Goh 
and Martina Hund-Mejean stepped down from the Board as Non-
executive Directors. They served on the Board for almost nine years 
and three years respectively.
Articles of association
The Company's Articles were amended and adopted on May 23, 
2023. The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of the 
shareholders in a general meeting. A full version of the Company's 
Articles can be found at shell.com/investors.
The following summarises certain provisions of the Articles [A] and of 
the applicable corporate legislation, including the Act (the legislation). 
This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and 
the Act. The information provided under this section is applicable to the 
Articles, which were in effect during the 2023 financial year to which 
this Report relates.
[A] A copy of the Articles has been previously filed with the SEC and is incorporated by 
reference as an exhibit to this Report. It can also be found at shell.com/investors.
Number of Directors
The Articles provide that the Company must have a minimum of three 
and can have a maximum of 20 Directors (disregarding alternate 
directors), but these restrictions can be changed by the Board.
Appointment of Directors
The Company can, by passing an ordinary resolution, appoint any 
willing person to be a Director, either as an extra director or to fill a 
vacancy where a director has stopped being a director for some 
reason. The Board can appoint any willing person to be a Director, 
either as an extra director or as a replacement for another director. 
Any Director appointed in this way must retire from office at the first 
AGM after his appointment. A Director who retires in this way is then 
eligible for reappointment. At the general meeting at which a Director 
retires, shareholders can pass an ordinary resolution to reappoint the 
Director or to appoint some other eligible person in their place.
The only people who can be appointed as Directors at a general 
meeting are the following: (i) Directors retiring at the meeting; (ii) 
anyone recommended by a resolution of the Board; and (iii) anyone 
nominated by a shareholder (not being a person to be nominated), 
where the shareholder is entitled to vote at the meeting and delivers to 
the Company's registered office, not less than six but not more than 21 
days before the day of the meeting, a letter stating that he intends to 
nominate another person for appointment as a Director and written 
confirmation from that person that he is willing to be appointed.
Retirement of Directors
At every AGM, the following Directors, at the date of the notice 
convening the AGM, shall retire from office: (i) any Director who has 
been appointed by the Board since the last AGM; (ii) any Director who 
held office at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did not 
retire at either of them; and (iii) any Director who has been in office, 
other than as a Director holding an executive position, for a continuous 
period of nine years or more at the date of the meeting.
Notwithstanding the Articles, the Company complies with the Code 
which contains, among other matters, provisions regarding the 
composition of the Board and re-election of the Directors. As a result, 
the Company's current policy is that Directors are subject to annual re-
election by shareholders. Any Director who retires at an AGM may 
offer themselves for reappointment by the shareholders.
Removal of Directors
In addition to any power to remove Directors conferred by the 
legislation, the Company can pass a special resolution to remove a 
Director from office, even though his time in office has not ended, and 
can (subject to the Articles) appoint a person to replace a Director who 
has been removed in this way by passing an ordinary resolution.
Vacation of office by Directors
Any Director automatically stops being a Director if: (i) he gives the 
Company a written notice of resignation and that resignation becomes 
effective; (ii) he gives the Company a written notice in which he offers 
to resign and the Board decides to accept this offer and that 
resignation becomes effective; (iii) all of the other Directors (who must 
comprise at least three people) pass a resolution or sign a written 
notice requiring the Director to resign; (iv) he is or has been suffering 
from mental or physical ill-health and the Board passes a resolution 
removing the Director from office; (v) he has missed Directors' meetings 
(whether or not an alternate director appointed by him attends those 
meetings) for a continuous period of six months without permission from 
the Board and the Board passes a resolution removing the Director 
from office; (vi) a bankruptcy order is made against him or he makes 
any arrangement or composition with his creditors generally; (vii) he is 
prohibited from being a Director under the legislation; or (viii) he 
ceases to be a Director under the legislation or he is removed from 
office under the Articles. If a Director stops being a Director for any 
reason, he will also automatically cease to be a member of any 
committee or sub-committee of the Board.
Alternate directors
Any Director can appoint any person (including another Director) to 
act in his place as an alternate director. That appointment requires the 
approval of the Board, unless previously approved by the Board or 
unless the appointee is another Director.

Proceedings of the Board
The Board will decide in each case when and where to have meetings 
and how they will be conducted. The Board can also adjourn its 
meetings. A Board meeting can be called by any Director. The 
secretary must call a directors' meeting if asked to by a director. If no 
other quorum is fixed by the Board, two Directors are a quorum. A 
Directors' meeting at which a quorum is present can exercise all the 
powers and discretions of the Board.
All or any of the Directors can take part in a meeting of the Directors 
by way of a conference telephone or any communication equipment 
which allows everybody to take part in the meeting by being able to 
hear each of the other people at the meeting and by being able to 
speak to all of them at the same time. A person taking part in this way 
will be treated as being present at the meeting and will be entitled to 
vote and be counted in the quorum. Any such meeting will be deemed 
to take place where the largest group of Directors participating is 
assembled or, if there is no such group, where the Chair of the 
meeting then is.
The Board can appoint any Director as Chair or as Deputy Chair and 
can remove him from that office at any time. Matters to be decided at 
a Directors' meeting will be decided by a majority vote. If votes are 
equal, the Chair of the meeting has a second, casting vote.
The Board will manage the Company's business. It can use all the 
Company's powers, except where the Articles or the legislation say that 
powers can only be used by shareholders voting to do so at a general 
meeting. The Board is, however, subject to the provisions of 
the legislation, the requirements of the Articles, and any regulations 
laid down by the shareholders by passing a special resolution at a 
general meeting.
The Board can exercise the Company's powers: (i) to borrow money; 
(ii) to guarantee; (iii) to indemnify; (iv) to mortgage or charge all or any 
of the Company's undertaking, property and assets (present and future) 
and uncalled capital; (v) to issue debentures and other securities; and 
(vi) to give security, either outright or as collateral security, for any 
debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any third party. The 
Board must limit the borrowings of the Company and exercise all voting 
and other rights or powers of control exercisable by the Company in 
relation to its subsidiary undertakings so as to ensure that no money is 
borrowed if the total amount of the group's borrowings (as defined in 
the Articles) then exceeds, or would as a result of such borrowing 
exceed, two times the Company's adjusted capital and reserves (as 
defined in the Articles). This limit can be exceeded if the consent of the 
shareholders has been given in advance by passing an ordinary 
resolution.
The Board can delegate any of its powers or discretions to committees 
of one or more persons. Any committee must comply with any 
regulations laid down by the Board. These regulations can require or 
allow people who are not Directors to be members of the committee, 
and can give voting rights to such people, but there must be more 
Directors on a committee than persons who are not Directors and a 
resolution of the committee is only effective if a majority of the members 
of the committee present at the time of the resolution were Directors.
Fees
The total fees paid to all the Directors (excluding any payments made 
under any other provision of the Articles) must not exceed £3,444,000 
a year, or any higher sum decided on by an ordinary resolution at a 
general meeting. It is for the Board to decide how much to pay each 
Director by way of fees. The Board, or any committee authorised by 
the Board, can award extra fees to any Director who serves on any 
committee or who devotes special attention to the business of the 
company or who otherwise, in its view, performs any special or extra 
services for the Company. The extra fees can take the form of salary, 
commission, profit-sharing or other benefits (and can be paid partly in 
one way and partly in another).
The Company can pay the reasonable travel, hotel and incidental 
expenses of each Director incurred in attending and returning from 
general meetings, meetings of the Board or committees of the Board or 
any other meetings which, as a Director, he is entitled to attend. The 
Company will pay all other expenses properly and reasonably incurred 
by each Director in connection with the Company's business or in the 
performance of his duties as a Director. The Company can also fund a 
Director's or former Director's expenditure and that of a Director or 
former Director of any holding company of the Company for the 
purposes permitted by the legislation and can do anything to enable a 
Director or former Director of the Company or any holding company of 
the Company to avoid incurring such expenditure all as provided in 
the legislation.
Pensions and gratuities
The Board or any committee authorised by the Board can decide 
whether to provide pensions, annual payments or other benefits to 
any Director or former Director of the company, or any relation or 
dependant of, or person connected to, such a person. The Board can 
also decide to contribute to a scheme or fund or to pay premiums to a 
third party for these purposes. The Company can only provide pensions 
and other benefits to people who are or were Directors but who have 
not been employed by, or held an office or executive position in, the 
Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings or former subsidiary 
undertakings or any predecessor in business of the Company or any 
such other company or to relations or dependants of, or persons 
connected to, these Directors or former Directors if the shareholders 
approve this by passing an ordinary resolution.
Directors' interests
Conflicts of interest requiring authorisation by Directors
The Board may, subject to the relevant quorum and voting requirements 
set out in the relevant Article, authorise any matter which would 
otherwise involve a Director breaching his duty under the legislation to 
avoid conflicts of interest. A Director seeking authorisation in respect of 
such a conflict of interest must tell the Board the nature and extent of 
his interest in the conflict of interest as soon as possible.
The Director must give the Board sufficient details of the relevant matter 
to enable it to decide how to address the conflict of interest, together 
with any additional information which it may request. Any Director 
(including the relevant Director) may propose that the relevant Director 
be authorised in relation to any matter which is the subject of such a 
conflict of interest. Such proposal and any authority given by the Board 
shall be effected in the same way as any other matter may be 
proposed to and resolved upon by the Board under the provisions of 
the Articles, except that: (i) the relevant Director and any other Director 
with a similar interest will not count in the quorum and will not vote on 
a resolution giving such authority; and (ii) the relevant Director and any 
other Director with a similar interest may, if the other members of the 
Board so decide, be excluded from any meeting of the Board while the 
conflict of interest is under consideration.
Where the Board gives authority in relation to a conflict of interest or 
where any of the situations described in (i) to (v) of "Other conflicts of 
interest" below applies in relation to a Director: (i) the Board may 
(whether at the relevant time or subsequently) (a) require that the 
relevant Director is excluded from the receipt of information, the 
participation in discussion and/or the making of decisions (whether at 
Directors' meetings or otherwise) related to the conflict or the relevant 
situation and (b) impose upon the relevant Director such other terms for 
the purpose of dealing with the conflict or relevant situation as they 
think fit; (ii) the relevant Director will be obliged to conduct himself in 
Governance
Other Regulatory and Statutory Information continued
206 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 208 ----
accordance with any terms imposed by the Board in relation to the 
conflict or relevant situation; (iii) the Board may also provide that, 
where the relevant Director obtains (other than through his position as 
a Director of the Company) information that is confidential to a third 
party, the Director will not be obliged to disclose that information to 
the Company, or to use or apply the information in relation to the 
Company's affairs, where to do so would amount to a breach of that 
confidence; (iv) the terms of the authority shall be recorded in writing 
(but the authority shall be effective whether or not the terms are so 
recorded); and (v) the Board may revoke or vary such authority at any 
time but this will not affect anything done by the relevant Director prior 
to such revocation in accordance with the terms of such authority.
Other conflicts of interest
If a Director knows that he or she is in any way directly or indirectly 
interested in a proposed contract with the Company or a contract that has 
been entered into by the Company, he must tell the other Directors of the 
nature and extent of that interest in accordance with the legislation. If the 
Director has so disclosed the nature and extent of his interest, a Director 
can do one or more of the following: (i) have any kind of interest in a 
contract with or involving the Company or another company in which the 
Company has an interest; (ii) hold any other office or place of profit with the 
Company (except that of auditor) in conjunction with his office of Director 
for such period and upon such terms, including as to remuneration, as the 
Board may decide; (iii) alone, or through a firm with which he is associated, 
do paid professional work for the Company or another company in which 
the Company has an interest (other than as auditor); (iv) be or become a 
Director or other officer of, or employed by a party to a transaction or 
arrangement with, or otherwise be interested in, any holding company or 
subsidiary company of the Company or any other company in which the 
Company has an interest; and (v) be or become a Director of any other 
company in which the Company does not have an interest and which 
cannot reasonably be regarded as giving rise to a conflict of interest at the 
time of his appointment as a Director of that other company.
Benefits
A Director does not have to hand over to the Company or the 
shareholders any benefit he receives or profit he makes as a result of 
any matter which would otherwise involve a direct breach of his or her 
duty under the legislation to avoid conflicts of interest but which has 
been authorised or anything allowed under (i) to (v) of "Other conflicts 
of interest" above, nor is any type of contract so authorised or so 
allowed liable to be avoided.
Quorum and voting requirements
Subject to certain exceptions, a Director cannot vote or be counted in 
the quorum on a resolution of the Board relating to appointing that 
Director to a position with the Company or a company in which the 
Company has an interest or the terms or the termination of the 
appointment, and a Director cannot vote or be counted in the quorum 
on a resolution of the Board about a contract in which he has an 
interest and, if he does vote, his vote will not be counted.
The Company can, by ordinary resolution, suspend or relax the 
provisions of the relevant article in the Articles to any extent or ratify 
any contract which has not been properly authorised in accordance 
with that relevant article.
Directors' indemnities
As far as the legislation allows this, the Company can indemnify any 
Director or former Director of the Company, of any associated 
company or of any affiliate against any liability and can purchase and 
maintain insurance against any liability for any Director or former 
Director of the Company, of any associated company or of any 
affiliate. A Director or former Director of the Company, of any 
associated company or of any affiliate will not be accountable to the 
Company or the shareholders for any benefit so provided. Anyone 
receiving such a benefit will not be disqualified from being or becoming 
a Director of the Company.
Rights attaching to shares
The Company can issue shares with any rights or restrictions attached 
to them as long as this is not restricted by any rights attached to 
existing shares. These rights or restrictions can be decided either by an 
ordinary resolution passed by the shareholders or by the Board as long 
as there is no conflict with any resolution passed by the shareholders.
Dividends
Currently, only ordinary shares are entitled to a dividend.
Under the legislation, dividends are payable only out of profits 
available for distribution, as determined in accordance with the Act 
and under IFRS. Subject to the Act, if the Directors consider that the 
Company's financial position justifies the payment of a dividend, the 
Company can pay a fixed or other dividend on any class of shares on 
the dates prescribed for the payments of those dividends and pay 
interim dividends on shares of any class of any amounts and on any 
dates and for any periods which it decides. Shareholders can declare 
dividends in accordance with the rights of shareholders by passing an 
ordinary resolution, although such dividends cannot exceed the amount 
recommended by the Board.
Dividends are payable to persons registered as the holder(s) of shares, 
or to anyone entitled in any other way, at a particular time on a 
particular day selected by the Board. All dividends will be declared 
and paid in proportions based on the amounts paid up on the relevant 
shares during any period for which that dividend is paid. Any dividend 
or other money payable in cash relating to a share can be paid: (i) by 
inter-bank transfer or by other electronic means (including payment 
through CREST) directly to an account with a bank or other financial 
institution (or other organisations operating deposit accounts if allowed 
by the Company) named in a written instruction from the persons 
entitled to receive the payment under the Articles, such account is to be 
an account in the United Kingdom unless the share on which the 
payment is to be made is held by Euroclear Nederland and the Dutch 
Securities Giro Act (Wet giraal effectenverkeer); (ii) by sending a 
cheque, warrant or similar financial instrument payable to the 
shareholder who is entitled to it by post addressed to his registered 
address; (iii) by sending a cheque, warrant or similar financial 
instrument payable to someone else named in a written instruction from 
the shareholder (or all joint shareholders) and sent by post to the 
address specified in that instruction; or (iv) in some other way if 
requested in writing by the shareholder (or all joint shareholders) and 
agreed with the Company. In respect of the payment of any dividend 
or other money, the Directors can decide and notify shareholders that: 
(i) one or more of the payment means described in paragraph above 
will be used for payment and, where more than one means will be 
used, a shareholder (or all joint shareholders) may elect to receive 
payment by one of the means so notified in the manner prescribed by 
the directors; (ii) one or more of such means will be used for the 
payment unless a shareholder (or all joint shareholders) elects for 
another means of payment in the manner prescribed by the Directors; 
or (iii) one or more of such means will be used for the payment and that 
shareholders will not be able to elect to receive the payment by any 
other means.
And for these purposes the Directors can decide that different means of 
payment will apply to different shareholders or groups of shareholders. 
If: (i) a shareholder (or all joint shareholders) does not specify an 
address, or does not (i) specify an account of a type prescribed by the 
Directors, or does not specify other details, and in each case that 
information is necessary in order to make a payment of a dividend or 
other money in the way in which, under the Article, the directors have 
decided that the payment is to be made or by which the shareholder 
Governance
Other Regulatory and Statutory Information continued
207 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 209 ----
(or all joint shareholders) has validly elected to receive the payment; or 
(ii) payment cannot be made by the company using the information 
provided by the shareholder (or all joint shareholders), then the 
dividend or other money will be treated as unclaimed for the purposes 
of these articles.
The Company will not be responsible for a payment which is lost or 
delayed. Unless the rights attached to any shares, the terms of any 
shares or the Articles say otherwise, a dividend or any other money 
payable in respect of a share can be declared and paid in whatever 
currency or currencies the Board decides using an exchange rate or 
exchange rates selected by the Board for any currency conversions 
required. The Board can also decide how any costs relating to the 
choice of currency will be met. The Board can offer shareholders the 
choice to receive dividends and other money payable in respect of 
their shares in alternative currencies on such terms and conditions as 
the Board may prescribe from time to time. Where any dividends or 
other amounts payable on a share have not been claimed, the Board 
can invest them or use them in any other way for the Company's benefit 
until they are claimed. The Company will not be a trustee of the money 
and will not be liable to pay interest on it. If a dividend or other money 
has not been claimed for 6 years after being declared or becoming 
due for payment, it will be forfeited and go back to the Company, 
unless the Board decides otherwise. If the company sells shares under 
the relevant Article, any dividend or other money unclaimed in respect 
of those shares will also be forfeited and go back to the Company 
when those shares are sold unless the Directors decide otherwise.
Prior to January 29, 2022, dividends in respect of B shares were paid 
under the dividend access mechanism described below. The Articles 
provide that if any amount paid by way of dividend by a subsidiary of 
the Company was received by the dividend access trustee on behalf of 
any holder of former B shares and paid by the dividend access trustee 
to such holder, the entitlement of such holder of former B shares to be 
paid any dividend declared pursuant to the Articles was reduced by 
the corresponding amount that has been paid by the dividend access 
trustee to such holder. Where amounts are paid by the dividend access 
trustee in one currency and a dividend was declared by the Company 
in another currency, the amounts so paid by the dividend access trustee 
was, for the purposes of the comparison required by the two 
immediately preceding sentences, converted into the currency in which 
the Company declared the dividend at such rate as the Board 
considered appropriate. For the purposes of the provisions referred to 
in this paragraph, the amount that the dividend access trustee has paid 
to any holder of B shares in respect of any particular dividend paid by 
a subsidiary of the Company (a "specified dividend") will be deemed to 
include: (i) any amount that the dividend access trustee may be 
compelled by law to withhold; (ii) a pro rata share of any tax that the 
subsidiary paying the specified dividend is obliged to withhold or to 
deduct from the same; and (iii) a pro rata share of any tax that is 
payable by the dividend access trustee in respect of the specified 
dividend. 
The Board can offer shareholders of ordinary shares (excluding any 
shareholder holding shares as treasury shares) the right to choose to 
receive extra ordinary shares, which are credited as fully paid up, 
instead of some or all of their cash dividend. Before the Board can do 
this, shareholders must have passed an ordinary resolution authorising 
the Board to make this offer.
Dividend access mechanism for B shares 
General
On January 29, 2022 one line of shares was established through 
assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share 
of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or 
dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on 
dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the 
ordinary shares following the assimilation. Prior to January 29, 2022, 
our A and B shares were identical, except for the dividend access 
mechanism, which only applied to B shares. 
In relation to the assimilation of the Company's Class A and B shares, 
the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust will continue in existence 
for the foreseeable future to facilitate the payment of unclaimed 
dividend liabilities for B shareholders, until these are either claimed or 
forfeited. Dividends which are unclaimed after 6 years will be forfeited 
and unconditionally revert to Shell Transport and BG, as appropriate.
Prior to January 29, 2022, it was the expectation and the intention, 
although there could be no certainty, that holders of B shares would 
receive dividends through the dividend access mechanism. Any 
dividends paid on the dividend access shares would have a UK source 
for UK and Dutch tax purposes. There would be no Dutch withholding 
tax on such dividends. For further details regarding the tax treatment of 
dividends paid, refer to "Shareholder information".
Description of dividend access mechanism
The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c., now The Shell 
Transport and Trading Company Limited (Shell Transport), and BG 
Group plc, now BG Group Limited (BG), have each issued a dividend 
access share to Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited as Trustee. 
Pursuant to a declaration of trust, the Trustee will hold any dividends 
paid in respect of the dividend access shares on trust for the holders of 
B shares and will arrange for prompt disbursement of such dividends to 
such holders. Interest and other income earned on unclaimed dividends 
will be for the account of Shell Transport and BG and any dividends 
which are unclaimed after 6 years will unconditionally revert to Shell 
Transport and BG, respectively, as appropriate. Holders of B shares 
will not have any interest in either dividend access share and will not 
have any rights against Shell Transport and BG as issuers of the 
dividend access shares. The only assets held on trust for the benefit of 
these holders will be dividends paid to the Trustee in respect of the 
dividend access shares.
The declaration and payment of dividends on the dividend access 
shares will require board action by Shell Transport and BG (as 
applicable) and will be subject to any applicable limitations in law or in 
the Shell Transport or BG (as appropriate) articles of association in 
effect. In no event will the aggregate amount of the dividend paid by 
Shell Transport and BG under the dividend access mechanism for a 
particular period exceed the aggregate of the dividend announced by 
the Board of the Company on B shares in respect of the same period 
(after giving effect to currency conversions).
In particular, under their respective articles of association, Shell 
Transport and BG are each only able to pay a dividend on their 
respective dividend access share which represents a proportional 
amount of the aggregate of any dividend announced by the Company 
on the B shares in respect of the relevant period, where such 
proportions are calculated by reference to, in the case of Shell 
Transport, the number of B shares in existence prior to completion of 
the Company's acquisition of BG (the Acquisition) and, in the case of 
BG, the number of B shares issued as part of the Acquisition, in each 
case as against the total number of B shares in issue immediately 
following completion of the Acquisition.
Operation of the dividend access mechanism
If, in connection with the announcement of a dividend by the Company 
on B shares, the Board of Shell Transport and/or the Board of BG 
elects to declare and pay a dividend on their respective dividend 
access shares to the Trustee, the holders of B shares will be beneficially 
entitled to receive their share of those dividends pursuant to the 
declaration of trust (and arrangements will be made to ensure that the 
Governance
Other Regulatory and Statutory Information continued
208 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 210 ----
dividend is paid in the same currency in which they would have 
received a dividend from the Company).
If any amount is paid by Shell Transport or BG by way of a dividend on 
the dividend access shares and paid by the Trustee to any holder of B 
shares, the dividend which the Company would otherwise pay on B 
shares will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to such 
holders of B shares by the Trustee.
The Company will have a full and unconditional obligation, in the event 
that the Trustee does not pay an amount to holders of B shares on a 
cash dividend payment date (even if that amount has been paid to the 
Trustee), to pay immediately the dividend announced on B shares. The 
right of holders of B shares to receive distributions from the Trustee will 
be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any payment actually 
made by the Company on account of any dividend on B shares. If for 
any reason no dividend is paid on the dividend access shares, holders 
of B shares will only receive dividends from the Company directly. Any 
payment by the Company will be subject to Dutch withholding tax 
(unless an exemption is obtained under Dutch law or under the 
provisions of an applicable tax treaty).
The Dutch tax treatment of dividends paid under the dividend access 
mechanism has been confirmed by the Dutch Revenue Service in an 
agreement (vaststellingsovereenkomst) with the Company and N.V. 
Koninklijke Nederlandsche Petroleum Maatschappij (Royal Dutch 
Petroleum Company) dated October 26, 2004, as supplemented and 
amended by an agreement between the same parties dated April 25, 
2005, and a final settlement agreement in connection with the 
Acquisition dated November 9, 2015. The agreements state, among 
other things, that dividend distributions on the dividend access shares 
by Shell Transport and/or BG will not be subject to Dutch withholding 
tax provided that the dividend access mechanism is structured and 
operated substantially as set out above.
The dividend access mechanism may be suspended or terminated at 
any time by the Company's Directors or the Directors of Shell Transport 
or BG, for any reason and without financial recompense. This might, for 
instance, occur in response to changes in relevant tax legislation.
The daily operations of the Trust are administered on behalf of the 
Company by the Trustee. Material financial information of the Trust is 
included in the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and is therefore 
subject to the same disclosure controls and procedures as Shell.
Pre-emption rights
Subject to the Act and the Listing Rules published by the UK's Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA), any equity securities allotted by the 
Company for cash must first be offered to shareholders in proportion to 
their holdings. The Act and the Listing Rules allow for the disapplication 
of pre-emption rights which may be waived by a special resolution of 
the shareholders, either generally or specifically.
Voting
Subject to applicable law and the Articles, the ordinary shares have 
voting rights on all matters that are subject to shareholder approval 
including the election of directors. Currently, the voting rights of each 
ordinary share carry one vote at a general meeting of the Company.
Major shareholders have no differing voting rights.
Changing the rights attached to the shares
The Act provides that the Articles can be amended by a special 
resolution.
The Articles provide that, if the legislation allows this, the rights 
attached to any class of shares can be changed in such manner as 
those rights may provide or (if no such provision is made) if this is 
approved either in writing by shareholders holding at least three-
quarters of the issued shares of that class by amount (excluding any 
shares of that class held as treasury shares) or by a special resolution 
passed at a separate meeting of the relevant shareholders. At each 
such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles relating to 
proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that: (i) a quorum will 
be present if at least one shareholder who is entitled to vote is present 
in person or by proxy who owns at least one-third in amount of the 
issued shares of the relevant class (excluding any shares of that class 
held as treasury shares); (ii) any shareholder who is present in person 
or by proxy and entitled to vote can demand a poll; and (iii) at an 
adjourned meeting, one person entitled to vote and who holds shares 
of the class, or his proxy, will be a quorum. These provisions are not 
more restrictive than required by law in England.
If new shares are created or issued which rank equally with any other 
existing shares, or if the company purchases or redeems any of its own 
shares, the rights of the existing shares will not be regarded as 
changed or abrogated unless the terms of the existing shares expressly 
say otherwise.
Redemption provisions
The Company's shares are not subject to any redemption provisions.
Disputes between a shareholder or American Depositary 
Share holder and Shell plc, any subsidiary, Director or 
professional service provider
The Articles generally require that, except as noted below, all disputes: 
(i) between a shareholder in such capacity and the Company and/or 
its Directors, arising out of or in connection with the Articles or 
otherwise; (ii) so far as permitted by law, between the Company and 
any of its Directors in their capacities as such or as the Company's 
employees, including all claims made by the Company or on behalf of 
the Company against any or all of its Directors; (iii) between a 
shareholder in such capacity and the Company's professional service 
providers (which could include the Company's auditors, legal counsel, 
bankers and ADS depositaries); and/or (iv) between the Company and 
its professional service providers arising in connection with any claim 
within the scope of (iii) above, shall be exclusively and finally resolved 
by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC), as amended from time to time. This 
would include all disputes arising under UK, Dutch or US law (including 
securities laws), or under any other law, between parties covered by 
the arbitration provision. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to 
obtain monetary or other relief, including in respect of securities law 
claims, may be determined in accordance with these provisions, and 
the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief may 
therefore be limited and their cost of seeking and obtaining recoveries 
in a dispute may be higher than otherwise would be the case.
The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators to be appointed in 
accordance with the ICC rules. The chairman of the tribunal must have 
at least 20 years' experience as a lawyer qualified to practise in a 
common-law jurisdiction which is within the Commonwealth (as 
constituted on May 12, 2005) and each other arbitrator must have 
at least 20 years' experience as a qualified lawyer. The place of

Pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction provision in the Articles, if a court 
or other competent authority in any jurisdiction determines that the 
arbitration requirement described above is invalid or unenforceable in 
relation to any particular dispute in that jurisdiction, then that dispute 
can only be brought in the courts of England and Wales, as is the case 
with any derivative claim brought under the Act. The governing law of 
the Articles is the substantive law of England.
Disputes relating to the Company's failure or alleged failure to pay all 
or part of a dividend which has been announced and which has fallen 
due for payment will not be subject to the arbitration and exclusive 
jurisdiction provisions of the Articles. Any derivative claim brought 
under the Act will not be subject to the arbitration provisions of the 
Articles.
Pursuant to the relevant depositary agreement, each holder of ADSs is 
bound by the arbitration and exclusive jurisdiction provisions of the 
Articles as described in this section as if that holder were a shareholder.
Calls on shares
The Board can call on shareholders to pay any money which has not 
yet been paid to the Company for their shares. This includes the 
nominal value of the shares and any premium which may be payable 
on those shares. The Board can also make calls on people who are 
entitled to shares by law.
Winding-up of the Company
If the Company is voluntarily wound up, the liquidator can distribute to 
shareholders any assets remaining after the liquidator's fees and 
expenses have been paid and all sums due to prior-ranking creditors 
(as defined under the laws of England) have been paid.
Sinking fund provisions
The shares are not subject to any sinking fund provision under the 
Articles or as a matter of the laws of England.
Discriminating provisions
There are no provisions in the Articles discriminating against a 
shareholder because of his ownership of a particular number of shares.
Limitations on rights to own shares
There are no limitations imposed by the Articles or the legislation on the 
rights to own shares, including the right of non-residents or foreign 
persons to hold or vote shares, other than limitations that would 
generally apply to all shareholders.
Transfer of shares
There are no significant restrictions on the transfer of shares.
Except as set out below, any shareholder can transfer some or all of his 
certificated shares to another person. A transfer of certificated shares 
must be made in writing and either in the usual standard form or in any 
other form approved by the Board. Except as set out below, any 
shareholder can transfer some or all of his CREST shares to another 
person. A transfer of CREST shares must be made through CREST and 
must comply with the uncertificated securities rules.
The Board can refuse to register the transfer of any shares which are 
not fully paid. Further rights to decline registration are as follows:
Certificated shares
A share transfer form cannot be used to transfer more than one class of 
share. Each class needs a separate form. Transfers cannot be in favour 
of more than four joint holders. The share transfer form must be 
properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty or 
certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be 
exempt from stamp duty and must be delivered to the Company's 
registered office, or any other place decided on by the Board. The 
transfer form must be accompanied by the share certificate relating to 
the share being transferred, unless the transfer is being made by a 
person to whom the Company was not required to, and did not send, a 
certificate. The Board can also ask (acting reasonably) for any other 
evidence to show that the person wishing to transfer the share is 
entitled to do so and, if the share transfer form is signed by another 
person on behalf of the person making the transfer, evidence of the 
authority of that person to do so.
CREST shares
Registration of a transfer of CREST shares can be refused in the 
circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules. Transfers 
cannot be in favour of more than four joint holders. Where a share has 
not yet been entered on the register, the Board can recognise a 
renunciation by that person of his right to the share in favour of some 
other person. Such renunciation will be treated as a transfer and the 
Board has the same powers of refusing to give effect to such a 
renunciation as if it were a transfer.
Partly paid shares
If a shareholder fails to pay the Company any amount due on his partly 
paid shares, the Board can enforce the Company's lien by selling all or 
any of the partly paid shares in any way they decide (subject to certain 
conditions).
Capital changes
The conditions imposed by the Articles for changes in capital are not 
more stringent than those required by the applicable laws of England.
Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other 
relief, including in respect of securities law claims, may be determined 
in accordance with these provisions, and the ability of shareholders to 
obtain monetary or other relief may therefore be limited and their cost 
of seeking and obtaining recoveries in a dispute may be higher than 
otherwise would be the case.
The tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators to be appointed in 
accordance with the ICC rules. The chairman of the tribunal must have 
at least 20 years' experience as a lawyer qualified to practise in a 
common-law jurisdiction which is within the Commonwealth (as 
constituted on May 12, 2005) and each other arbitrator must have at 
least 20 years' experience as a qualified lawyer. The place of 
arbitration must be London, United Kingdom; and the language of the 
arbitration must be English.
Pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction provision in the Articles, if a court 
or other competent authority in any jurisdiction determines that the 
arbitration requirement described above is invalid or unenforceable in 
relation to any particular dispute in that jurisdiction, then that dispute 
may only be brought in the courts of England and Wales, as is the case 
with any derivative claim brought under the Act. The governing law of 
the Articles is the substantive law of England.

Pursuant to the depositary agreement, each holder of ADSs is bound 
by the arbitration and exclusive jurisdiction provisions contained in the 
relevant depositary agreement, which are substantially similar to the 
Articles as described in this section as if that holder were a shareholder.
General Meetings
Under the applicable laws of England, the Company is required in 
each year to hold an AGM of shareholders in addition to any other 
meeting of shareholders that may be held. Each AGM must be held 
in the period six months from the date following the Company's 
accounting reference date.
Additionally, shareholders may submit resolutions in accordance 
with Section 338 of the Act.
Directors have the power to convene a general meeting of 
shareholders at any time. In addition, Directors are required to call 
a general meeting once requests to do so have been received by the 
Company from shareholders representing at least 5% of such paid-up 
capital of the Company as carries voting rights at general meetings of 
the Company (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury shares) 
pursuant to Section 303 of the Act. A request for a general meeting 
must state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the 
meeting and must be authenticated by the requesting shareholders. If 
Directors fail to call such a meeting within 21 days from receipt of such 
requests, and on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the 
notice convening the meeting, the shareholders that requested the 
general meeting, or any of them representing more than half of the 
total voting rights of all shareholders that requested the meeting, may 
themselves convene a general meeting which must be called for a date 
not more than three months after the date upon which the Directors 
became subject to the requirement to call a general meeting. Any such 
meeting must be convened in the same manner, as nearly as possible, 
as that in which meetings are required to be convened by the Directors 
of the Company.
Under the Act, the Company is required to give at least 21 clear days' 
notice of any AGM or, except where the conditions in Section 307A of 
the Act apply, any other general meeting of the Company. In addition, 
the Company complies with the Financial Reporting Council guidance 
which currently states that notices of AGMs should be sent to 
shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting.
The Articles require that, in addition to any requirements under the 
legislation, the notice for any general meeting must state where the 
meeting is to be held (the principal meeting place) and the location 
of any satellite meeting place, which shall be identified as such in the 
notice as well as details of any arrangements made for those persons 
not entitled to attend a general meeting to be able to view and 
hear the proceedings (making it clear that participation in those 
arrangements will not amount to attendance at the meeting to 
which the notice relates). 
A shareholder is entitled to appoint a proxy (who is not required 
to be another shareholder) to represent and vote on behalf of the 
shareholder at any general meeting of shareholders, including the 
AGM, if a duly completed form of proxy has been received by the 
Company within the relevant deadlines (in general, where a poll is 
not demanded, 48 hours (or such shorter time as the Board decides) 
before the meeting).
Before a general meeting starts to do business, there must be a 
quorum present. Save as in relation to adjourned meetings, a quorum 
for all purposes is two people who are entitled to vote. They can be 
shareholders who are personally present, proxies for shareholders, or 
a combination of both. If a quorum is not present, a chairman of the 
meeting can still be chosen and this will not be treated as part of the 
business of the meeting. If a quorum is not present within five minutes of 
the time fixed for a general meeting to start or within any longer period 
not exceeding one hour which the chairman of the meeting can decide, 
or if a quorum ceases to be present during a general meeting: (i) if the 
meeting was called by shareholders, it will be cancelled; (ii) any other 
meeting will be adjourned to a day (being not less than 10 days later, 
excluding the day on which it is adjourned and the day for which it is 
reconvened) with the time and place decided upon by the chairman of 
the meeting; and (iii) one shareholder present in person or by proxy 
and entitled to vote will constitute a quorum at any such adjourned 
general meeting and any notice of such adjourned meeting will 
say this.
Deemed delivery of documents
Under the Articles, if any notice, document or other information is 
given, sent or supplied by the Company by inland post, it is treated as 
being received the day after it was posted if first class post (or a service 
similar to first class post) was used, or 48 hours after it was posted if 
first class post (or a service similar to first class post) was not used. If a 
notice or document is sent by the Company by airmail, it is treated as 
being received 72 hours after it was posted. Any notice, document or 
other information left at a shareholder's registered address or a postal 
address notified to the Company in accordance with the Articles by a 
shareholder or a person entitled to a share by law is treated as being 
received on the day on which it was left.
Threshold for disclosure of share ownership
The Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the FCA impose an 
obligation on persons [A] to notify the Company of the percentage of 
voting rights held as a shareholder, or through the direct or indirect 
holding of financial instruments, if the percentage of voting rights held 
in the Company reaches, exceeds or falls below 3% or any 1% 
threshold above 3%.
[A] For this purpose “persons” includes companies, natural persons, legal persons 
and partnerships.
As noted in the Articles, Section 793 of the Act governs the Company’s 
right to investigate who has an interest in its shares. Under that section, 
a public company may give notice to any person it knows or has 
reasonable cause to believe is, or was at any time in the preceding 
three years, interested in its shares in order to obtain certain 
information about that interest.
The Articles provide that, when a person receives a statutory notice, he 
has the time stated in such notice to comply with it. If he does not do so 
or if he makes a statement in response to the notice which is false or 
inadequate in some important way, the Company can decide to restrict 
the rights relating to the identified shares and send out a further notice 
to the shareholder, known as a restriction notice, which will take effect 
when delivered. The restriction notice will state that the identified 
shares no longer give the shareholder any right to attend or vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders' meeting or to exercise any 
right in relation to shareholders' meetings. Where the identified shares 
make up 0.25% or more (in amount or in number) of the existing shares 
of a class at the date of delivery of the restriction notice, the restriction 
notice can also contain the following further restrictions: (i) the Board 
can withhold any dividend or part of a dividend (including scrip 
dividend) or other money which would otherwise be payable in respect 
of the identified shares without any liability to pay interest when such 
money is finally paid to the shareholder; and (ii) the Board can refuse 
to register a transfer of any of the identified shares which are 
certificated shares unless the Board is satisfied that they have been sold

outright to an independent third party (as specified in the Articles). 
Once a restriction notice has been given, the Board is free to cancel it 
or exclude any shares from it at any time the Board thinks fit. In 
addition, the Board must cancel the restriction notice within seven days 
of being satisfied that all of the information requested in the statutory 
notice has been given. Also, where any of the identified shares are sold 
and the Board is satisfied that they were sold outright to an 
independent third party, it must cancel the restriction notice within 
seven days of receipt of notification of the sale. The Articles do not 
restrict in any way the provision of the legislation which applies to 
failures to comply with notices under the legislation.
The UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the Takeover Code) 
imposes disclosure obligations on parties subject to the Takeover 
Code's disclosure regime. The Takeover Code requires that an opening 
position disclosure be made by: (i) an offeror company after the 
announcement that first identifies it as an offeror and after the 
announcement that first identifies a competing securities exchange 
offeror; and (ii) an offeree company after the commencement of an 
offer period and, if later, after the announcement that first identifies 
any securities exchange offeror. An opening position disclosure must 
be made by any person that is interested in 1% or more of any class of 
relevant securities of the offeree company or any securities exchange 
offeror. The Takeover Code also requires any person who is, or 
becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities 
of an offeree company or any securities exchange offeror to make a 
dealing disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the 
offeree company or any securities exchange offeror during an offer 
period. Where two or more persons act together pursuant to an 
agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or 
control an interest in relevant securities, they will normally be deemed 
to be a single person for the purpose of the relevant provisions of the 
Takeover Code.
Rule 13d-1 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that a 
person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of 
equity securities registered under the US Securities Exchange Act, and 
that is not eligible to file a short-form report, disclose such information 
to the SEC within five business days after the acquisition.

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of Shell plc 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Shell plc (Shell or the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and 
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the Consolidated Financial Statements). In our opinion, the 
Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in conformity with UK 
adopted international accounting standards. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 
13, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with 
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included 
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing 
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Critical audit matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were 
communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to 
the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit 
matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the 
critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 
The estimation of oil and gas reserves
Description of the 
matter
As described in Notes 11 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023, production assets amounted to 
$110.7 billion and had an associated depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A) charge of $18.2 billion and joint venture and 
associates (JVAs) amounted to $24.5 billion. As further described in Note 12, exploration and production impairment charges of $4.8 
billion and exploration and production impairment reversals of $0.5 billion were recorded during the year. Oil and gas reserves 
estimates are used in the calculation of DD&A and impairment testing. The risk is the inappropriate recognition of reserves that impacts 
these accounting estimates. 
Auditing the estimation of oil and gas reserves is complex. There is significant estimation uncertainty in assessing the quantities of 
reserves and resources in place. The estimates are based on the Company’s central group of experts’ assessments of petroleum initially 
in place, production curves and certain other inputs, including prices, license expiration date, capex and opex. Estimation uncertainty is 
further elevated given the transition to a low-carbon economy, which increases the risk of underutilised or stranded oil and gas assets. 
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's oil and gas reserves' estimation process. We then evaluated the design of 
these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested management's review controls over changes to year-on-
year estimated oil and gas reserves volumes.
We involved professionals with oil and gas reserves audit experience to assist us in evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies 
applied by management.
Our procedures included, amongst others, testing that significant additions or reductions in reserves had been made in the period in 
which new information became available, and assessing whether they were in compliance with Shell's reserves and resources guidance. 
Evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of management's reserves experts who performed the preparation of the 
reserve estimates and who are primarily responsible for providing independent review and challenge, and ultimately endorsement of, 
the reserve estimates. We observed the internal review and endorsement process at Shell's Upstream Reserves Committee meetings. 
These meetings are part of Shell's proved reserves assurance process.
We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the above-mentioned inputs used by management in estimating the oil and gas reserves 
by agreeing the inputs to source documentation and performed back testing of historical data to identify indications of estimation bias 
over time. 
In order to address the risk of stranded assets, among other procedures, we estimated the carbon intensity of Shell's Upstream and 
Integrated Gas fields to analyse assets that are currently forecast to be producing beyond 2030 and 2050 and the expected carbon 
intensity per barrel of those fields. For assets that we identified as carbon intensive that are expected to have material carrying value in 
2030 and 2050, we evaluated the risk that the carrying value of these assets will not be recovered. This included considering the 
decarbonisation plans of these assets and alignment to Shell's strategy.

Impairment of Property, plant & equipment (PP&E) and Joint venture and associates (JVA)
Description of the 
matter
As described in Notes 11 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023 Shell recognised $110.7 billion of 
production assets, $49.2 billion of manufacturing, supply and distribution assets (primarily refineries and petrochemical plants) and 
$24.5 billion of joint ventures and associates (JVAs). As disclosed in Note 12, Shell recognised $8.2 billion impairment losses and $0.6 
billion impairment loss reversals.
The recoverable amounts of PP&E and JVAs are sensitive to changes in key assumptions, therefore our audit effort was focused on the 
completeness and timely identification of indicators of impairment charges or impairment reversals. 
Auditing the impairment assessments of PP&E and JVAs is subjective due to the judgement involved in determining whether indicators of 
impairment or impairment reversal exist, particularly for longer term assets, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal. 
The key assumptions underpinning the impairment assessments include changes in future commodity price and refining margin 
assumptions. In addition, management forecast carbon prices, expected production volumes, the assumed weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC), changes in asset performance and future development plans and the expected useful lives of assets. The estimation of 
forecast commodity prices and refining and petrochemical margins are particularly judgmental because of, among other factors, 
increased demand uncertainty and pace of decarbonisation due to climate change and the energy transition.
How we addressed 
the matter in our 
audit
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's asset impairment process. We then evaluated the design of these controls 
and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested the controls over management's identification of indicators of 
impairment and reversals of impairment and the approval of oil and gas prices and refining margins.
We evaluated Shell's assessment of impairment and impairment reversal triggers, including changes in the forecast commodity price 
assumptions, movements in oil and gas reserves (see oil and gas reserves critical audit matter), changes in asset performance and 
changes in Shell's business and operating plan assumptions. We further considered assets with high carbon intensity as a potential 
indicator of impairment, given Shell's carbon emissions reductions targets. 
We considered potential impairment triggers related to climate change and energy transition by estimating the carbon intensity of Shell's 
Upstream and Integrated Gas fields and identifying the most carbon intensive assets. We performed correlation between reserves, 
production and emissions data and assessed management's plans to reduce the carbon intensity of these assets in the future to 
determine whether there is a material risk that reserves recognised will not be produced or if the carbon intensity limited the expected 
useful lives of the assets. We assessed consistency of Shell's plans to reduce the carbon intensity of these assets with their carbon 
emissions reductions targets and whether these actions have been reflected in Shell's operating plan, which impact Shell's financial 
statements and disclosures. Also, we assessed the operating and capital expenditure assumptions that were estimated necessary to 
achieve the emission reductions. This also involved assessing assumptions on acquisitions, divestments, investments in CCS technologies 
and Nature Based Solutions.
In addition, we considered contradictory evidence, such as the results of comparable market transactions by other energy companies in 
jurisdictions with similar environmental and regulatory focus that could indicate a material increase or decrease in the recoverable 
amount of Shell's assets. We also considered Shell's targets made in relation to emissions reductions and whether these could impact the 
future potential value of any assets. We performed a risk assessment on Shell's assets from a climate change physical risk perspective, 
considering asset and geographical specific factors to assess whether the existence of any increased physical risks represented a trigger 
for impairment. We then obtained an understanding of how management has incorporated historic, current and potential future asset 
integrity plans in the Shell operating plan. 
We also assessed potential operational changes that have or are expected to have a significant adverse effect on an asset and whether 
such unplanned shutdowns should be considered as impairment triggers. 
To test Shell's commodity price assumptions, amongst other procedures, we compared future short and long-term oil and gas prices to an 
independently developed reasonable range of forecasts based on consensus analysts' forecasts and those adopted by other 
international oil companies. To evaluate the impact of energy transition on Shell's commodity price forecasts applied in the preparation 
of the financial statements, we compared Shell's oil and gas price scenarios to the IEA's Net Zero Emissions 2050 (NZE) and to the IEA's 
Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) price assumptions. We evaluated the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin assumptions by 
comparing these to independent market and consultant forecasts. Through the IEA scenarios on World Energy Consumption, we 
considered the expected impact on demand for oil products and chemicals in a transition to a net zero economy. We also involved our 
oil and gas valuations specialists to assess the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin estimation methodology and assumptions, 
including evaluating long-run demand forecasts, incorporating the impacts of the energy transition, supply dynamics, and the speed of 
the industry's response to changing demand through either constructing new refineries or closing older refineries. Given the downward 
pressure on refining margins, we assessed whether this represented a trigger for impairment by assessing the impact of reduced margins 
in the context of the overall lives of Shell's petrochemicals facilities. 
To evaluate the accuracy of significant assumptions we performed a lookback by comparing actual performance of assets to the 
forecasts made in the prior year. 
We assessed the adequacy of Shell's disclosure of information about the assumptions Shell makes that could, in the future, have a 
significant risk of material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, including sensitivity disclosures. This included 
evaluating the sensitivity disclosures in Note 4 of the carrying value of Shell's Upstream, Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products 
PP&E assets against a range of future oil and gas price assumptions, reflecting reduced demand scenarios due to climate change and 
the energy transition, including the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario.

Accounting for complex transactions within Shell's Trading and Supply (T&S) function and the valuation of financial derivatives
Description of the matter As described in Note 25, Shell recognised derivative financial instrument assets of $15.9 billion and derivative financial instrument 
liabilities of $11.8 billion. As described in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2023 Shell recognised 
$317 billion of revenue. A subset of the consolidated revenue relates to T&S transactions, where there is a risk of unrealised revenues 
being inappropriately recorded. 
Shell's trading and supply function is integrated within the Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products and 
Renewables and Energy Solutions segments. The function executes and settles standard and non-standard complex trades. 
Auditing complex trades is challenging because of the significant judgement used in determining the appropriate accounting treatment, 
and the key assumptions used in valuing the trades. Also, trading is not always carried out in active markets where prices are readily 
available, increasing subjectivity used in determining the pricing curve and volatility assumptions, which are key inputs to valuing the 
trades and in determining unrealised gains and losses.
How we addressed the 
matter in our audit
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the recognition of revenue relating to unrealised trading gains 
and losses, including controls over management's complex deals accounting and valuations. We then evaluated the design of these 
controls and tested their operating effectiveness.
We involved audit professionals with experience auditing large commodity trading organisations.
We obtained an understanding of the commercial rationale of complex deals by analysing the executed agreements and through 
discussions with management. Also, we performed an independent assessment of the accounting treatment of each of the complex deals 
taking into consideration actual contract terms and previous accounting judgements.
We assessed the completeness of the list of complex deals by performing an independent search considering non-standard contractual 
terms, multiple commodity-based transactions, long term contracts, unobservable inputs and complex valuation models. Also, we 
performed external confirmation procedures for the existence and completeness of contract terms.
We assessed the reasonableness of Shell's derivative valuation methodology by comparing it to market practice, analysing whether a 
consistent framework was applied and checked the consistency of inputs used in deal valuations and other assumptions. 
We tested the forward pricing curve and volatility assumptions in management's valuation models, including comparison to external 
broker quotes, market consensus providers, and our independent assessments and further reviewed valuation reserve adjustment for a 
sample of material complex contracts. We involved EY valuation specialists to assist us in performing testing of the valuation models of 
Level 3 contracts, including the valuation of long-dated offtake contracts and those with illiquid tenor or price components. Our 
valuations were established using externally sourced inputs, where available.

To the shareholders and Board of Directors of Shell plc 
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Shell plc's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). 
In our opinion, Shell plc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2023, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, and our report dated March 13, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting as set out in the Other regulatory and statutory information section. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's 
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be 
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included 
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating 
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance 
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or 
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that 
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

220 Shell Form 20-F 2023

---- Page 222 ----
 
1. Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Shell") have been prepared 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable 
to companies reporting under those standards. As applied to Shell, there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. 
As described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on March 13, 2024.
Going concern
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. In assessing the appropriateness of the 
going concern assumption over the period to March 31, 2025 (the "going concern period"), management have stress-tested Shell's most recent 
financial projections to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering Shell's principal risks, further potential downside pressures 
on commodity prices and long-term demand, and cash preservation measures, including reduced future capital expenditure and shareholder 
distributions. This assessment confirmed that Shell has adequate cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet its 
obligations as they fall due in order to continue its operations during the going concern period. Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates
This Note describes Shell's material accounting policies. It allows for an understanding as to how material transactions, other events and conditions 
are reported. It also describes: (a) judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management makes in applying the policies that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (b) estimations, including assumptions about the 
future, that management makes in applying the policies. The sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are specifically identified as a significant estimate. 
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the adoption as from January 1, 2023, of IFRS 
17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17) and IAS 12 Income taxes (IAS 12) amendments.
The transition to the accounting pronouncements as listed below has no material impact on Shell's financial reporting.
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts
IFRS 17 as issued in 2017, with amendments published in 2020 and 2021, was adopted as from January 1, 2023. The IFRS 17 model combines a 
current balance sheet measurement of insurance contracts with recognition of profit over the period that services are provided. The general model 
in IFRS 17 requires insurance contract liabilities to be measured using probability-weighted current estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment to 
reflect the time value of money and financial and non-financial risk, and a contractual service margin representing the profit expected from fulfilling 
the contracts. Effects of changes in the estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment relating to future services are recognised over the 
period services are provided rather than immediately in profit or loss. 
The adoption of IFRS 17 has no significant impact on Shell's financial reporting.
Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)
IAS 12 amendments, published in May 2021, were adopted as from January 1, 2023 (see Note 22). These amendments require companies to 
recognise deferred tax on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary 
differences. The amendments typically apply to transactions where assets and liabilities are recognised from a single transaction, such as leases 
for the lessee and decommissioning and restoration provisions.
The adoption of these IAS 12 amendments has no significant impact on Shell's financial reporting.
International Tax Reform — Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12)
In May 2023, amendments to IAS 12 were published and adopted from that date. The amendments introduce a temporary mandatory relief from 
accounting for deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two Model Rules (Pillar Two or Pillar Two income taxes). On 
June 20, 2023, the UK substantively enacted Pillar Two. The adoption of Pillar Two by the jurisdictions in which Shell operates is not expected to 
have a significant impact (see Note 22). As required by the amendments to IAS 12, Shell has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing 
information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.
Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars (dollars) and comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable 
returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entities. Information about subsidiaries at December 31, 2023, can 
be found in "Exhibit 8.1: Significant subsidiaries and other related undertakings (audited)".

---- Page 223 ----
2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control ceases, using consistent accounting 
policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interest represents the 
proportion of income, other comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the Company's shareholders.
Currency translation 
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at quarter-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (including those in respect of inter-company balances, unless related to loans 
of a long-term investment nature) are recognised in income unless when recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow or 
net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses in income are presented within interest and other income or within purchases where 
not related to financing. Share capital issued in currencies other than the dollar is translated at the exchange rate at the date of issue. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of non-dollar entities are translated to dollars at year-end rates of exchange, while their statements of 
income, other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at monthly average rates. Prior to January 1, 2023, these currency translations 
were performed at quarterly average rates. This change has no significant impact on Shell's financial reporting. The resulting translation differences 
are recognised as currency translation differences within other comprehensive income. Upon sale of all or part of an interest in, or upon liquidation 
of, an entity, the appropriate portion of cumulative currency translation differences related to that entity is generally recognised in income. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of oil, natural gas, chemicals and other products is recognised at the transaction price to which Shell expects to be entitled, 
after deducting sales taxes, excise duties and similar levies. For contracts that contain separate performance obligations, the transaction price 
is allocated to those separate performance obligations by reference to their relative stand-alone selling prices. 
Revenue is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the customer. For sales by Integrated Gas and Upstream operations, 
this generally occurs when the product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism; for sales by refining operations, 
it is either when the product is placed onboard a vessel or offloaded from the vessel, depending on the contractually agreed terms; and for sales 
of oil products and chemicals, it is either at the point of delivery or the point of receipt, depending on contractual conditions. 
Revenue resulting from hydrocarbon production from properties in which Shell has an interest with partners in joint arrangements is recognised on 
the basis of Shell's volumes lifted and sold. Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) 
is recognised for those amounts relating to Shell's cost recoveries and Shell's share of the remaining production. Gains and losses on derivative 
contracts and the revenue and costs associated with other contracts that are classified as held primarily for the purpose of being traded are 
reported on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of hydrocarbons under exchange contracts that are 
necessary to obtain or reposition feedstocks for the refinery operations are presented net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Revenue resulting from arrangements that are not considered contracts with customers is presented as revenue from other sources.
Research and development 
Development costs that are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised as intangible assets. All other research 
and development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income as incurred.
Exploration costs 
Hydrocarbon exploration costs are accounted for under the successful efforts method: exploration costs are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income when incurred, except that exploratory drilling costs, including in respect of the recapitalisation of depreciation, are included 
in property, plant and equipment pending determination of proved reserves. Exploration costs capitalised in respect of exploration wells that are 
more than 12 months old are written off unless: (a) proved reserves are booked; or (b) (i) they have found commercially producible quantities 
of reserves; and (ii) they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way 
or firmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the assessing of reserves and the economic 
and operating viability of the project. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill
Recognition
Property, plant and equipment comprise assets owned by Shell, assets held by Shell under lease contracts, and assets operated by Shell as 
contractor in PSCs. They include rights and concessions in respect of properties with proved reserves ("proved properties") and with no proved 
reserves ("unproved properties"). Property, plant and equipment, including expenditure on major inspections, and intangible assets are initially 
recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost where it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits. This includes 
capitalisation of decommissioning and restoration costs associated with provisions for asset retirement (see "provisions"), certain development 
costs (see "research and development") and the effects of associated cash flow hedges (see "financial instruments") as applicable. Interest 
is capitalised as an increase in property, plant and equipment, on major capital projects during construction. The accounting for exploration 
costs is described separately (see "exploration costs"). Intangible assets other than goodwill include liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-take 
and sales contracts, environmental certificates, power purchase agreements, software costs, retail customer relationships and trademarks. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation (including any impairment). Gains and losses on sale are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amounts of assets sold and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income, within interest and other income.

An asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, which is 
when the sale is highly probable, and it is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
for sales of such assets. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount upon classification and the fair value 
less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale and the associated liabilities are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once assets are classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than 
goodwill are no longer subject to depreciation or amortisation.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation
Property, plant and equipment related to hydrocarbon production activities are in principle depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the 
proved developed reserves of the field concerned, other than assets whose useful lives differ from the lifetime of the field which are depreciated 
applying the straight-line method. For certain Integrated Gas and Upstream assets, the use of proved developed reserves, which are determined 
using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated yearly average oil and gas prices, could result in depreciation charges for these 
assets which do not reflect the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed as, for example, it may result in assets 
with long-term expected lives having accelerated or being fully depreciated within one year. Therefore, in these instances, other approaches are 
applied to determine a reserves base for the purpose of calculating depreciation, such as using management's expectations of future oil and gas 
prices rather than yearly average prices and using total proved reserves to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that more 
appropriately reflects the expected utilisation of the assets concerned. (See Note 11)
Rights and concessions in respect of proved properties are depleted on the unit-of-production basis over the total proved reserves of the relevant 
area. Where individually insignificant, unproved properties may be grouped and depreciated based on factors such as the average concession 
term and past experience of recognising proved reserves. 
Property, plant and equipment held under lease contracts, capitalised LNG off-take and sales contracts and power purchase agreements are 
depreciated or amortised over the term of the respective contract. Other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill 
are depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. They include energy and chemicals parks (for which the 
useful life is generally 20 years), retail service stations (for which the useful life is generally 15 years), onshore power infrastructure (for which the 
useful life is generally 30-35 years), offshore wind assets (for which the useful life is generally 25-30 years) and major inspection costs, which 
are depreciated over the estimated period before the next planned major inspection (three to five years).
On classification of an asset as held for sale, depreciation ceases. 
Estimates of the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed annually 
and adjusted if appropriate.
Impairment
Intangible assets other than goodwill and assets other than unproved properties (see "Exploration costs") are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the carrying amounts of those assets are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less
costs of disposal (see "Fair value measurements") and value in use.
Value in use is determined as the amount of estimated risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash-
generating units based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows. Estimates of future cash flows used in the evaluation of 
impairment of assets are made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with 
operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly related to CO₂, and forecast product, refining and chemical margins. In addition, 
management takes into consideration the expected useful lives of the manufacturing facilities, exploration and production assets, and expected 
production volumes. The latter takes into account assessments of field and reservoir performance and includes expectations about both proved 
reserves and volumes that are expected to constitute proved reserves in the future (unproved volumes), which are risk-weighted utilising 
geological, production, recovery and economic projections. Cash flow projections are based on management's most recent Operating Plan that 
represents management's best estimate and are risked as appropriate. The discount rate is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC). Using a
post-tax discount rate to calculate value in use does not result in a materially different outcome than using a pre-tax discount rate. (See Note 12).
Impairments are reversed as applicable to the extent that the events or circumstances that triggered the original impairment have changed.
Impairment losses and reversals are reported within depreciation, depletion and amortisation.
Upon classification of an asset as held for sale, the carrying amount is impaired if this exceeds the fair value less costs to sell.

Judgements and estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves
Unit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are principally measured based on management's estimates of proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. Also, exploration drilling costs are capitalised pending the results of further exploration or appraisal activity 
(successful efforts method), which may take place for several years before the final investment decision on a development project is taken 
and before any related proved reserves can be booked. 
Proved reserves are estimated by internal qualified professionals. The proved reserves are estimated with reasonable certainty by analysis 
of available geological and engineering data at the time of the estimation, and only include volumes for which access to market is assured 
with reasonable expectation. Yearly average oil and gas prices are used for the estimation of proved reserves unless prices are defined by 
contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Proved reserves are subject to regular revision, both upward 
or downward, based on new information from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing 
conditions, updates of development plans and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms, legislation or 
development plans.
Changes to estimates of proved developed reserves affect prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged 
and, consequently, the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets. Generally, in the normal course of business the diversity 
of the asset portfolio will limit the net effect of such revisions. The outcome of, or assessment of plans for, exploration or appraisal activity 
may result in the related capitalised exploration drilling costs being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in that period. 
Judgement is involved in determining when to use an alternative reserves base in order to appropriately reflect the expected utilisation 
of the assets concerned (see "Depreciation, depletion and amortisation"). 
Information about the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets and the amounts charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Income, including depreciation, depletion and amortisation and the quantitative impact of the use of an alternative reserves base, 
is presented in Note 11. 
Impairment 
For the purposes of determining whether impairment of assets has occurred, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal, the key 
assumptions management uses in estimating risk-adjusted future cash flows for value in use measures are future oil and gas prices and product 
margins including refining and chemical margins. In addition, management uses other assumptions such as potential costs associated with 
operational GHG emissions, market supply and demand, expected production volumes and forecast expenditure. These assumptions and the 
judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Changes in assumptions 
could affect the carrying amounts of assets, and any impairment losses and reversals will affect income. Changes in economic conditions can 
affect the rate used to discount future cash flow estimates or the risk adjustment in the future cash flows. Judgement is applied to conclude 
whether changes in assumptions or economic conditions are an indicator that an asset may be impaired or that an impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist, or may have decreased. 
Expected production volumes, which comprise proved reserves and unproved volumes, are used for impairment testing because management 
believes this to be the most appropriate indicator of expected future cash flows. Reserves estimates are inherently imprecise. Furthermore, 
projections about unproved volumes are based on information that is necessarily less robust than that available for mature reservoirs. 
Estimation is involved with respect to the expected life of energy and chemicals parks, including management's view on the future 
development of refining margins. 
The determination of cash-generating units requires judgement. Changes in this determination could impact the calculation of value in use 
and therefore the conclusion on the recoverability of assets' carrying amounts when performing an impairment test. 
Judgement, which is subject to change as new information becomes available, can be required in determining when an asset is classified 
as held for sale. A change in that judgement could result in impairment charges affecting income, depending on whether classification 
requires a write-down of the asset to its fair value less costs to sell. 
In assessing the value in use, the estimated risk-adjusted future post-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax 
discount rate that reflects Shell's post-tax WACC. (See Note 12). The level of risking reflected in the cash flow assumptions is a consideration 
in management's assessment of the discount rate to be applied in order to avoid duplication of systemic and asset-specific risking in 
calculating value in use, and to ensure the discount rate applied is commensurate with risks included in forecast cash flows.
Significant estimates 
Assumptions about future commodity prices and refining and chemical margins used in the impairment testing in, respectively, Integrated 
Gas and Upstream and Chemicals and Products (see Note 12) are regularly assessed by management, noting that management does not 
necessarily consider short-term increases or decreases in prices as being indicative of long-term levels. 
The price methodology applied is based on Shell management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals 
in the near term, taking into account various other factors such as industry rationalisation and energy transition in the long term.
Future commodity prices and refining margins used in impairment testing provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to 
in paragraph 125 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1.125).
Information about the carrying amounts of assets and impairments and their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in Note 12.

Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for any non-controlling 
interest over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date. The amount 
recognised for any non-controlling interest is measured as a percentage of the identified net assets of the acquiree based on the present 
ownership's proportionate share. At the acquisition date, acquired goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit (CGU), or groups of CGUs, 
expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. The CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level at which the goodwill 
will be monitored and managed. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is subsequently measured at the initial amount recognised less any accumulated impairment losses. (See Note 12).
Impairment 
The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable 
amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. An impairment loss is recognised when the CGU's recoverable amount is lower than its 
carrying amount.
Previously recognised impairment losses of goodwill are not reversed subsequently.
Leases
A contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for payments to 
be made to the owners (lessors) is accounted for as a lease. Contracts are assessed to determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the 
inception of a contract or when the terms and conditions of a contract are significantly changed. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a 
lease, together with contractual options to extend or to terminate the lease early, where it is reasonably certain that an extension option will be 
exercised or a termination option will not be exercised.
At the commencement of a lease contract, a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset are recognised, unless the lease term is 12 
months or less. The commencement date of a lease is the date on which the underlying asset is made available for use. The lease liability is 
measured at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The lease liability 
includes contingent rentals and variable lease payments that depend on an index, rate, or where they are fixed payments in substance. The lease 
liability is remeasured when the contractual cash flows of variable lease payments change due to a change in an index or rate when the lease 
term changes following a reassessment.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate is not readily available, the incremental borrowing rate 
is applied. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a 
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.
In general, a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any pre-paid 
lease payment relating to the specific lease contract. The depreciation on right-of-use assets is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income unless capitalised as exploration drilling cost (see "exploration cost") or capitalised when the right-of-use asset is used to construct another 
asset.
Where Shell is the lessor in a lease arrangement at inception, the lease arrangement will be classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. 
Classification is based on the extent to which the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset lie with the lessor or the lessee.
Where Shell, usually in its capacity as operator, has entered into a lease contract on behalf of a joint arrangement, a lease liability is recognised 
to the extent that Shell has primary responsibility for the lease liability. A finance sublease is subsequently recognised if the related right-of-use 
asset is subleased to the joint arrangement. This is usually the case when the joint arrangement has the right to direct the use and obtains 
substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset.
Impairment of the right-of-use asset
Right-of-use assets are subject to existing impairment requirements as set out in "Property, plant and equipment", above, and as presented
in Note 12.
Judgements and estimates 
A lease term includes optional lease periods where it is reasonably certain Shell will exercise the option to extend or not exercise the option 
to terminate the lease. Determination of the lease term is subject to judgement and has an impact on the measurement of the lease liability 
and related right-of-use asset. When assessing the lease term at the commencement date, Shell takes into consideration the broader 
economics of the contract. Reassessment of the lease term is performed upon changes in circumstances that may affect the probability 
that an option to extend or to terminate the lease will be exercised.
Where the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects 
the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Determination of the incremental borrowing 
rate requires estimation.

Joint arrangements and associates 
Arrangements under which Shell has contractually agreed to share control (see "Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements" for 
the definition of control) with another party or parties are joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, 
or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Investments in entities 
over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are classified as associates. Information about incorporated joint 
arrangements and associates at December 31, 2023, can be found in "Exhibit 8.1: Significant subsidiaries and other related undertakings 
(audited)".
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognised at 
cost and subsequently adjusted for the Shell share of post-acquisition income less dividends received and the Shell share of other comprehensive 
income and other movements in equity, together with any loans of a long-term investment nature. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of Shell. In an exchange of assets 
and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the non-Shell share of any excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred over 
the pre-exchange carrying amounts is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Unrealised gains on other transactions between 
Shell and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of Shell's interest in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly but 
may also result in an assessment of whether the asset transferred is impaired. 
Shell recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly and liabilities incurred 
jointly with other partners. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost comprises direct purchase costs (including transportation), 
and associated costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present condition and location, and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method for oil, gas and chemicals and by the weighted average cost method for materials. 
Taxation
The charge for current tax is calculated based on the income reported by the Company and its subsidiaries, as adjusted for items that are
non-taxable or disallowed and using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is determined, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and on unused tax losses and credits carried forward. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when an asset 
is realised or a liability is settled. They are not recognised where they arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction (other than in a business combination) that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, or in respect 
of taxable temporary differences associated with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the respective temporary 
difference can be controlled by Shell and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward can be utilised. 
Income tax receivables and payables as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities include provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments. 
Income taxes are recognised in income except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. Income tax assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except 
where there is a right of offset within fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle such balances on a net basis.
Judgements and estimates 
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority. In such 
cases, provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for uncertain 
income tax positions/treatments are measured at the most likely amount or the expected value, whichever method is more appropriate. 
Generally, uncertain tax treatments are assessed on an individual basis, except where they are expected to be settled collectively. It is 
assumed that taxing authorities will examine positions taken if they have the right to do so and that they have full knowledge of the 
relevant information. A change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow and/or in the expected amount to be settled would be 
recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. This requires the application of judgement as to the ultimate outcome, 
which can change over time depending on facts and circumstances. Judgements mainly relate to transfer pricing, including inter-company 
financing, interpretation of PSCs, expenditure deductible for tax purposes and taxation arising on disposal.

Judgements and estimates continued 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an 
assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available 
to offset the assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. To 
the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the amounts recognised in respect 
of deferred tax assets as well as in the amounts recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. 
Taxation information, including charges and deferred tax assets and liabilities, is presented in Note 22. Income taxes include taxes at higher 
rates levied on income from certain Integrated Gas and Upstream activities. 
Retirement benefits 
Benefits in the form of retirement pensions and health care and life insurance are provided to certain employees and retirees under defined benefit 
and defined contribution plans.
Obligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which takes into 
account employees' years of service and, for pensions, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and of a duration consistent with the 
plan obligations. Where plans are funded, payments are made to independently managed trusts; assets held by those trusts are measured at fair 
value. Defined benefit plan surpluses are recognised as assets to the extent that they are considered recoverable, which is generally by way of 
a refund or lower future employer contributions.
The amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit plans mainly comprise service cost and net interest. Service cost comprises 
principally the increase in the present value of the obligation for benefits resulting from employee service during the period (current service cost) 
and also amounts relating to past service and settlements or amendments of plans. Plan amendments are changes to benefits and are generally 
recognised when all legal and regulatory approvals have been received and the effects have been communicated to members. Net interest is 
calculated using the net defined benefit liability or asset matched against the discount rate yield curve at the beginning of each year for each 
plan. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset resulting from actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding 
the amount recognised in income, are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution plans, pension expense represents the amount of employer contributions payable for the period. 
Significant judgements and estimates 
Defined benefit obligations and plan assets, and the resulting liabilities and assets that are recognised, require significant estimation as these 
are subject to volatility as (actuarial) assumptions regarding future outcomes and market values change. Substantial judgement is required 
in determining the actuarial assumptions, which vary for the different plans to reflect local conditions but are determined under a common 
process in consultation with independent actuaries. The assumptions applied in respect of each plan are reviewed annually and adjusted 
where necessary to reflect changes in experience and actuarial recommendations. 
Actuarial assumptions applied in determining defined benefit obligations provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in IAS 1.125.
Information about the amounts reported in respect of defined benefit pension plans, assumptions applicable to the principal plans and their 
sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in Note 23. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised at the balance sheet date at management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. 
Non-current amounts are discounted at a rate intended to reflect the time value of money. The carrying amounts of provisions and the discount 
rate applied are regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts or changes in law, technology or financial markets.

Provisions for decommissioning and restoration costs, which arise principally in connection with hydrocarbon production facilities, oil products 
manufacturing facilities and pipelines, are measured on the basis of current requirements, technology and price levels; the present value is 
calculated using amounts discounted over the useful economic life of the assets. The liability is recognised (together with a corresponding amount 
as part of the related property, plant and equipment) once a legal or constructive obligation arises to dismantle an item of property, plant and 
equipment and to restore the site on which it is located and when a reasonable estimate can be made. The effects of changes resulting from 
revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of the provision are reflected on a prospective basis, generally by adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment. However, where there is no related asset, or the change reduces the carrying 
amount to nil, the effect, or the amount in excess of the reduction in the related asset to nil, is recognised in income. 
Shell reviews its energy and chemicals parks on a regular basis to determine whether any changes in assumptions, including expected life, 
trigger the need to recognise a provision for decommissioning and restoration.
Redundancy provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and 
number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs and an appropriate timeline, and the employees affected have been 
notified of the plan's main features. 
An onerous contract provision is recognised when the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable cost under a contract is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. 
Before an onerous provision is recognised Shell first recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.
Other provisions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which an obligation arises and the amount can be 
reasonably estimated. Provisions are measured based on current legal requirements and existing technology where applicable. Recognition 
of any joint and several liability is based on management's best estimate of the final pro rata share of the liability. Provisions are determined 
independently of expected insurance recoveries. Recoveries are recognised when virtually certain of realisation. 
Estimates 
Estimates of provisions for future decommissioning and restoration costs are recognised and based on current legal and constructive 
requirements, technology and price levels. Because actual cash outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, 
public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions 
are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of such changes. 
Significant estimate
The discount rate applied to reflect the time value of money in the carrying amount of provisions requires estimation. The discount rate used 
in the calculation of provisions is the pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Generally, the market 
assessments of the time value of money can be reflected in the risk-free rate and given the long-term investment nature of oil and gas business, 
Shell considers it appropriate to use the 20-year US Treasury bond yield return as the risk-free rate. The discount rate applied is reviewed 
regularly and adjusted following changes in market rates. 
The discount rate applied to determine the carrying amount of provisions provides a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in IAS 1.125.
Information about decommissioning and restoration provisions and their sensitivity to changes in estimates is presented in Note 24. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a legally enforceable right 
of offset and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
or fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets is determined by the contractual cash flows and where applicable the 
business model for managing the financial assets. 
Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost, if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual 
cash flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. It is initially recognised at fair value 
plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Subsequently, the financial asset is 
measured using the effective interest method less any impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired. 
All equity instruments and other debt instruments are recognised at fair value. For equity instruments, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election 
(on an instrument-by-instrument basis) can be made to designate these as at fair value through other comprehensive income instead of fair value 
through profit or loss. Dividends received on equity instruments are recognised as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when Shell benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case such 
gains are recorded in other comprehensive income.

Investments in securities
Investments in securities ("securities") comprise equity and debt securities. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Generally, unrealised holding 
gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive 
income are transferred to retained earnings. Debt securities are generally carried at fair value with unrealised holding gains and losses recognised 
in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in income.
Impairment of financial assets
The expected credit loss model is applied for recognition and measurement of impairments in financial assets measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income. The expected credit loss model is also applied for financial guarantee contracts to which IFRS 9 
applies and which are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss 
allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. Changes in loss allowances are recognised 
in profit or loss. For trade receivables, a simplified impairment approach is applied recognising expected lifetime losses from initial recognition. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including offsetting bank overdrafts, short-term bank deposits, money market funds, 
reverse repos and similar instruments that generally have a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, such as instruments 
held for trading, or Shell has opted to measure them at fair value through profit or loss. Debt and trade payables are recognised initially at fair 
value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost except for fixed rate debt subject to fair value 
hedging which is remeasured for the hedged risk (see below). Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method, and 
other than interest capitalised, is recognised in income. For financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option, the change in the fair 
value related to own credit risk is recognised in other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value change is recognised at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Derivative contracts and hedges 
Derivative contracts are used in the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, and foreign currency 
cash balances. Derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract in terms of economic characteristics and risks and the host contract of 
which is not a financial asset are separated from their host contract and recognised at fair value with the associated gains and losses recognised 
in income.
Contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash are accounted for as financial instruments, with the exception of those 
contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Shell's 
expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as 
effective hedging instruments are recognised in income.
Certain derivative contracts qualify and are designated either: as a fair value hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
or an unrecognised firm commitment; or as a cash flow hedge for the change in cash flows to be received or paid relating to a recognised asset 
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction; or as a net investment hedge of the change in foreign exchange rates associated with net 
investments in foreign operations with a different functional currency than Shell's functional currency.
A change in the fair value of a hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recognised in income, together with the consequential 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item. The effective portion of a change in fair value of a derivative contract designated as a 
cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs; any ineffective portion is recognised in income. 
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the asset or liability (reclassified to the balance sheet); a net investment hedge is accounted for similarly to a cash flow hedge. 
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income while any 
gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income. On disposal of the foreign operation, 
the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The effective portion of a change due to retranslation at quarter-end exchange rates in the carrying amount of debt and the principal amount of 
derivative contracts used to hedge net investments in foreign operations is recognised in other comprehensive income until the related investment 
is sold or liquidated; any ineffective portion is recognised in income.
All relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are documented, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for 
undertaking hedge transactions. The effectiveness of hedges is also continually assessed and hedge accounting is discontinued when there is 
a change in the risk management strategy.
Unless designated as hedging instruments, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items that can be settled net as if the contracts were financial 
instruments and that do not meet expected own-use requirements (typically, forward sale and purchase contracts for commodities in trading 
operations), and contracts that are or contain written options, are recognised at fair value; associated gains and losses are recognised in income.
Derivatives that are held primarily for the purpose of trading are presented as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Judgement
Judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell LNG are capable of being settled on a net basis. Due to the limited 
liquidity in the LNG market and the lack of net settlement history, contracts to buy or sell LNG are not considered capable of being settled 
on a net basis. As a result, these contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis and not as a financial instrument. 
Fair value measurements
Fair value measurements are estimates of the amounts for which assets or liabilities could be transferred at the measurement date, based on 
the assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use 
into account.
Estimate 
Where available, fair value measurements are derived from prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. In the absence of 
such information, other observable inputs are used to estimate fair value. Inputs derived from external sources are corroborated or otherwise 
verified, as appropriate. In the absence of publicly available information, fair value is determined using estimation techniques that take into 
account market perspectives relevant to the asset or liability, in as far as they can reasonably be ascertained, based on predominantly 
unobservable inputs. For derivative contracts where publicly available information is not available, fair value estimations are generally 
determined using models and other valuation methods, the key inputs for which include future prices, volatility, price correlation, counterparty 
credit risk and market liquidity, as appropriate; for other assets and liabilities, fair value estimations are generally based on the net present 
value of expected future cash flows. 
Share-based compensation plans
The fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) - 
Shell's main equity-settled plans - is estimated using the average Monte Carlo fair values and is recognised in income from the date of grant over 
the vesting period with a corresponding increase directly in equity. The model projects and averages the results for a range of potential outcomes 
for the vesting conditions, the principal assumptions for which are the share price volatility and dividend yields for Shell and four of its main 
competitors using respectively three years and 10 years of historical data.
Shares held in trust
Shares in the Company, which are held by employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities, are not included in assets but are reflected 
at cost as a deduction from equity as shares held in trust.
Acquisitions and sales of interests in a business 
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed when control is obtained over a business, and when an interest or an additional interest is acquired in 
a joint operation which is a business, are recognised at their fair value at the date of the acquisition; the amount of the purchase consideration 
above this value is recognised as goodwill. When control is obtained, any non-controlling interest is recognised as the proportionate share of the 
identifiable net assets. The acquisition of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and the sale of an interest while retaining control are accounted 
for as transactions within equity. The difference between the purchase consideration or sale proceeds after tax and the relevant proportion of the 
non-controlling interest, measured by reference to the carrying amount of the interest's net assets at the date of acquisition or sale, is recognised 
in retained earnings as a movement in equity attributable to Shell plc shareholders. 
Emission schemes and related environmental programmes
Emission certificates, biofuel certificates and renewable power certificates (together "environmental certificates") held for trading purposes are 
recognised at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower, and classified under inventory.
Emission trading schemes
Emission certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost and classified under intangible assets. In the schemes 
where a cap is set for emissions, the associated emission certificates granted are recognised at cost, which may be zero. An emission liability 
is recognised under other liabilities when actual emissions occur that give rise to an obligation. To the extent the liability is covered by emission 
certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these emission certificates held and for the 
remaining uncovered portion at market value. The associated expense is presented under "Production and manufacturing expenses". Both 
the emission certificates and the emission liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.
Biofuel programmes
Biofuel certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost under intangible assets. Self-generated biofuel 
certificates are recognised at nil value, as they primarily offset the obligation. A biofuel liability is recognised under other liabilities when the 
obligation arises under local regulations. To the extent covered by biofuel certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with 
reference to the value of these certificates held and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. The associated expense is presented 
under "purchases". Biofuel certificates and the biofuel liability are both derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Renewable power programmes
Renewable power certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost as an intangible asset. Self-generated renewable 
power certificates are generally transferred to the customer upon sales of electricity. A renewable power liability is recognised under other 
liabilities when electricity sales take place that give rise to an obligation to retire renewable power certificates. The associated cost is recognised 
in "purchases" in the income statement. If the obligation relates to power consumed in business operations, it is presented in other liabilities with 
cost reflected in "Production and manufacturing expenses". To the extent covered by renewable power certificates held for compliance purposes, 
the liability is measured with reference to the value of these renewable power certificates and for the remaining uncovered portion at market 
value. Renewable power certificates and the renewable power liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.
Consolidated Statement of Income presentation 
Purchases reflect all costs related to the acquisition of inventories and the effects of the changes therein, and include associated costs incurred in 
conversion into finished or intermediate products. Production and manufacturing expenses are the costs of operating, maintaining and managing 
production and manufacturing assets. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses include direct and indirect costs of marketing and selling 
products.

4. Climate change and energy transition continued
Note 2 Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates describes uncertainties, including those that have the potential to have a material effect 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the next 12 months. This note describes the key areas of climate impacts that potentially have short-, medium- 
and longer-term effects on amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. Where relevant, this note contains 
references to other notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and aims to provide an overarching summary of the energy transition impact. 
In 2021, Shell launched its Powering Progress strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. The strategy aims to deliver more 
value with less emissions. Targets include reduction of absolute emissions from operations and the energy Shell buys to run them, compared with 
2016 baseline. Shell's targets include reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a net basis under operational control by 50% by 2030, compared with 
2016 baseline, achieving near-zero methane emissions for operated oil and gas assets by 2030 and eliminating routine gas flaring from Shell's 
upstream-operated assets by 2025 (subject to the completion of the divestment of Shell's interest in The Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
Nigeria Limited (SPDC)). Shell's target is to reduce the net carbon intensity of energy products sold by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% 
by 2030 and 100% by 2050, compared to a 2016 baseline. In March 2024, Shell set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions (Scope 3, 
Category 11) related to the use of oil products sold by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021.
Financial planning and assumptions
This section provides an overview of key assumptions used for financial planning related to climate change and the energy transition. These 
assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in these financial statements -- such as future oil and gas prices, future chemical and refining 
margins, discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, carbon emission cost and deferred tax assets - take climate change and 
energy transition into account and are similarly used for impairment testing of carrying amounts of assets. The areas described focus on those most 
pertinent to Shell's business and how financial planning and assumptions interact with scenarios. Subsequently, the sensitivity of carrying amounts 
to commodity prices, carbon emission costs, chemical and refining margins, discount rates and demand, if different assumptions were applied, is 
described.
There is no one single scenario that underpins the financial statements. Shell scenarios are designed to challenge management's perspectives on 
the future business environment and stretch management to consider events that may be only remotely possible. As a result, these scenarios are 
not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and are not the basis for Shell's financial statements and Operating Plans. 
Shell scenarios and the range of possible outcomes inform the development of Shell's strategy and Shell's view on future oil and gas price 
outlooks, refining margins and chemical margins. The oil and gas price outlooks are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's financial 
statements. Shell's scenarios inform high-, mid- and low-price outlooks. The mid-price outlook represents management's reasonable best estimate 
and is the basis for Shell's financial statements, Operating Plans and impairment testing. Impairment testing applies management's reasonable best 
estimates across the full life cycle of assets, which may go beyond the operating plan period.
Shell's targets including to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a net basis [A] by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 baseline, and a 
15-20% reduction of net carbon intensity [B] by 2030 have been included in Shell's Operating Plan. The Operating Plan also includes expected 
costs for evolving carbon regulations (see section "Carbon price sensitivities" below) based on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions from 
operated and non-operated assets, also taking into account the estimated impact of free allowances. For impairment testing purposes key 
assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, such as future oil and gas prices, refining margins, chemical 
margins, discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, carbon emission cost and tax rates, all go beyond the planning horizon 
in the Operating Plan and do take climate change and energy transition into account.

For Integrated Gas and Upstream, sensitivity to commodity prices and carbon prices has been tested (see below) covering the carrying amount 
of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and joint ventures and associates. Sensitivity testing was performed applying 
alternative price scenarios to the forecasted cash flows for the whole period until the end of life of the asset tested. For Chemicals and Products, 
sensitivity to chemical margins, refining margins and carbon prices has been tested (see below). Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions 
are expected to be resilient through the energy transition with limited exposure of stranded assets. 
In addition, sensitivity to changes in the discount rate applied in impairment testing has also been tested (see below).
In calculating recoverable value, key assumptions are not determined in isolation, to ensure relevant interdependencies are appropriately 
reflected. In particular, management considers the relationship between discount rates, forecast commodity prices and cash flow risking to ensure 
impairment testing assumptions result in an implicit expected return which is balanced and appropriate for the asset under review. Each of the 
sensitivities described above has been tested under a ceteris paribus assumption where all other factors remain unchanged, and as such do 
not reflect the potential offsetting effects of corresponding changes in other assumptions.

Within Integrated Gas and Upstream, the assets potentially most sensitive to the energy transition are production assets and exploration and 
evaluation assets. Both production assets of $111 billion and exploration and evaluation assets of $5 billion are recognised within Property, 
plant and equipment within Integrated Gas and Upstream.
Portfolio composition and changes
Since 2016, the carrying amount of production assets in Integrated Gas and Upstream decreased from $169 billion as at December 31, 2016, 
to$111 billion as at December 31, 2023. Over this period, depreciation was higher than additions for each year, and disposals of property, 
plant and equipment with a carrying amount of $26 billion occurred. The carrying amount of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenses 
decreased from $19 billion as at December 31, 2016, to $5 billion at December 31, 2023. This is the result of final investment decisions, 
reclassifications to production assets and amounts charged to expenses exceeding additions.
Estimated useful life
The energy transition and the pace at which it progresses may impact the remaining life of assets. Integrated Gas and Upstream assets are 
generally depreciated using a unit-of-production methodology where depreciation generally depends on production of SEC proved reserves 
(see Note 2). Based on production plans of existing assets, 43%, 7% and 1% of SEC proved reserves as at December 31, 2023, would currently 
be left by 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. Based on the unit-of-production depreciation methodology applied, carrying amounts for 
individual assets are depreciated to nil in the same pattern as the depletion of reserves towards nil. An analysis of Integrated Gas and Upstream 
production assets of $111 billion as at December 31, 2023, based on planned reserves depletion shows that these assets would be significantly 
further depreciated under the unit-of-production method by 2030 and nearly fully depreciated by 2050. This provides a further perspective on 
the risk of stranded assets carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2023. 
Price sensitivities using climate pricelines
As noted, in accordance with IFRS, Shell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent 
management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. The mid-price outlook informed 
by Shell's scenario planning represents management's best estimate. A change of -10% or +10% to the mid-price outlook, as an average 
percentage over the whole life cycle of assets, would result in around $5-8 billion (2022: $2-5 billion) impairment or $2-5 billion
(2022: $2-4 billion) impairment reversal respectively in Integrated Gas and Upstream (see Note 12). Compared with the prior year, the higher 
impact of a 10% decrease in commodity prices is mainly driven by lower headroom for certain assets between carrying value and recoverable 
value at December 31, 2023.  
The energy transition will continue to bring volatility and there is significant uncertainty as to how commodity prices will develop over the next 
decades. Some pricelines see a structurally lower price during the transition period, while other pricelines see structurally higher commodity prices 
as a result of changes in supply and demand. As the risk of stranded assets is prevalent with downside price risk in energy transition scenarios, 
sensitivities have only been undertaken for such downside scenarios. If different price outlooks from external and often normative climate change 
scenarios were used, this would impact the recoverability of certain assets recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 
2023. These external scenarios are not representative of management's mid-price reasonable best estimate.
Sensitivity of carrying amounts to commodity prices described below is under the assumption that all other factors in the models used -- such 
as cost levels, volumes, mid-price CO2 assumptions and the discount rate -- to calculate recoverability of carrying amounts remain unchanged. 
Sensitivity testing has been performed by applying the alternative commodity price scenarios to cash flows for the whole period until the end of life 
of the assets tested, which may extend beyond the operating plan period. The alternative commodity prices were applied in the local cash flow 
models and thereafter aggregated by segment. Changes to commodity prices are applied because of the significant impact on Shell's business. 
It should be noted that a significant decrease in long-term forecasted commodity prices would probably lead to further changes, such as in 
portfolio choices and cost levels.
Sensitivity to changes in commodity prices in value in use calculations has been tested as follows:
Priceline 1 – Average prices from three 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change scenarios: in view of the broad range of price outlooks 
across the various scenarios, the average of three external price outlooks was taken.

￮ IHS Markit/ACCS 2023 – under this scenario oil prices (real terms 2023 (RT23)) gradually decrease towards $25 per barrel (/b) in 2037, 
gradually recovering to $63/b in 2045 with subsequent levels until 2050 ranging between $62/b and $69/b. Gas prices (RT23) are around 
$3 per million British thermal units (/MMBtu) until 2050 for Henry Hub. For Europe, prices decrease from $17/MMBtu in 2024 towards around 
$3/MMBtu in 2030, remaining around that level until 2050. For Asia, prices decrease from $18/MMBtu in 2024 towards around $3/MMBtu 
in 2031, staying at a level between $3 and $4/MMBtu until 2050.
￮ Woodmac WM AET-1.5 degree – under this scenario oil prices (RT23) gradually decrease towards $28/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT23) are 
around $3/MMBtu until 2033 and subsequently some $4/MMBtu until 2046, thereafter some $3/MMBtu until 2050 for Henry Hub. For 
Europe, gas prices (RT23) decrease gradually from around $15/MMBtu in 2024 to some $5/MMBtu in 2050. For Asia, gas prices decrease 
from$15/MMBtu in 2024 to $7/MMBtu in 2031, subsequently ranging between $6/MMBtu and $10/MMBtu until 2050.
￮ IEA NZE50 – under this scenario oil prices (RT23) gradually decrease towards some $26/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT23) decrease from 
some$5/MMBtu in 2024 to around $2/MMBtu for Henry Hub in 2030, remaining slightly below that level until 2050. For Europe and Asia, 
gas prices (RT23) decrease from some $26/MMBtu and $14/MMBtu respectively in 2024 to some $4/MMBtu and $6/MMBtu respectively 
around 2030 staying at that level until 2050.
This average priceline provides an external view of the development of commodity prices under 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change 
scenarios over the whole period under review. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion (2022: $75 billion) and Upstream assets of $84 billion (2022: $88 billion) as at 
December 31, 2023, shows recoverable amounts that are $12-16 billion (2022: $4-6 billion) and $3-5 billion (2022: $1-2 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. For Integrated Gas the change in sensitivity compared with 2022 reflects lower 
near-term gas prices applied in the priceline for Europe and Asia, alongside lower headroom for certain assets between carrying value and 
recoverable value at December 31, 2023. For Upstream the change in sensitivity compared with 2022 reflects lower oil prices applied in the 
priceline alongside lower headroom for certain assets between carrying value and recoverable value at December 31, 2023 
Priceline–2 - Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: this priceline applies Shell's mid-price outlook for the next 10 years (see Note 12). Because of 
the greater uncertainty for the period after 10 years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied. 
This gives less weight to the price-risk uncertainty in the first 10 years reflected in the operating plan period and applies more risk to the more 
uncertain subsequent periods. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion (2022: $75 billion) and Upstream assets of $84 billion (2022: $88 billion) as at 
December 31, 2023, shows recoverable amounts that are $8-10 billion (2022: $4-6 billion) and $1-3 billion (2022: $1-2 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. For Integrated Gas the change in sensitivity compared with 2022 is largely 
driven by lower near-term Shell mid-prices applied, an increased differential between the Shell mid-price and the gas prices applied in sensitivity 
testing for Europe and Asia from 2034 onwards and lower headroom for certain assets between carrying value and recoverable value at 
December 31, 2023. 
Priceline–3 - IEA NZE50: this priceline applies the IEA normative Net Zero Emissions scenario over the whole period under review. This priceline 
has been applied in order to also reflect the sensitivity to a pure net-zero emissions scenario from the IEA.
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion (2022: $75 billion) and Upstream assets of $84 billion (2022: $88 billion) as at 
December 31, 2023, shows recoverable amounts that are $15-20 billion (2022: $9-12 billion) and $3-5 billion (2022: $8-11 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. For Integrated Gas the change in sensitivity compared with 2022 is largely 
driven by an increased differential between the Shell mid-price and the gas prices applied in sensitivity testing for Europe and Asia from 2030 
onwards and lower headroom for certain assets between carrying value and recoverable value at December 31, 2023. For Upstream the change 
in sensitivity compared with 2022 is largely driven by higher near-term oil prices applied in the priceline, partly offset by lower headroom for 
certain assets between carrying value and recoverable value at December 31, 2023.

 Oil price assumptions
[A] The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is a group of 127 central banks and supervisors and 20 observers committed to sharing best practices, contributing to the 
development of climate– and environment–related risk management in the financial sector and mobilising mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy. 
This scenario results from the NGFS GCAM model. This model embodies certain assumptions on the relationships between economic and energy output and climate interactions. 
This NGFS scenario shows a decline in world oil demand relative to the current policies baseline, in part a response to substitution away from fossil fuels. At the same time prices 
increase due to supply constraints. 
[B] All figures are presented on RT23 basis unless noted differently.
The graph above shows the oil pricelines on a real-terms basis applied for the period until 2050 for Shell's mid-price outlook in comparison 
with the IEA announced pledges (IEA APS) scenario, the NGFS GCAM NZE 2050 scenario, the average prices from three 1.5-2 degrees Celsius 
external climate change scenarios (Priceline 1, above) and the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario (IEA NZE50, Priceline 3 above). The 
development of future oil prices is uncertain and oil prices have been subject to significant volatility in the past. Future oil prices may be impacted 
by future changes in macroeconomic factors, available supply, demand, geopolitical and other factors. The pricelines as per the scenarios NGFS 
GCAM NZE 2050, IEA APS, the average prices from three 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change scenarios and IEA NZE50 differ from 
Shell's best estimate and view of the future oil price.

Carbon price sensitivities
Carbon costs in the Operating Plan
The Operating Plan includes capital expenditure and operating costs to achieve Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets (see above). These 
include asset level abatement project costs that drive efficiencies and reduce emissions, expected costs for evolving carbon regulations based 
on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions and costs of offsets for any residual amounts. 
The total capital expenditure for abatement projects in relation to efficiency improvements, energy and chemicals parks transformations and 
use of renewable power included in the Operating Plan is in excess of $5 billion (2022: $4 billion). Total yearly carbon emission costs in Shell's 
Operating Plan gradually increase from $1 billion in 2024 to $4 billion in 2033 using the mid-price scenario. The sensitivity of carrying values 
of assets to changes in carbon prices is described in the section below. 
Methods for estimating costs vary, depending on the nature of the cost. Abatement projects costs to improve efficiencies and reduce emissions 
are estimated by applying a bottom-up approach where individual opportunities on an asset-level, project-by-project basis are identified. 
Costs for evolving carbon regulations are based on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions and are included in the Operating Plan at Shell's
mid-price outlook on a country-by-country basis and represent management's best estimate. In the short and near term, up to around 2030, costs 
for carbon emissions estimates are largely policy driven, through emission trading schemes or taxation levied by governments which currently 
vary significantly on a country-by-country basis. Beyond 2030, where policy predictions are more challenging, the costs for carbon emissions 
are estimated based on the expected costs of abatement technologies required for 2050. The estimated costs are trending towards $125 or 
$170 per tonne (RT23), depending on the country [A], in 2050. This outlook used for the Operating Plan sits within the middle of abatement costs 
range of $100-200 which incorporates a broad range of technologies.
[A] Except for the Netherlands and Norway where the estimated mid-price assumption is around $220 per tonne in 2050.

Sensitivity to changes in carbon price assumptions
There is significant uncertainty as to how carbon costs will develop over the next decades. These will depend on policies set by countries and 
the pace of the energy transition. In accordance with IFRS, Shell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
that represent management's current best estimate, which is policy based up to 2030 and then based on the mid-price outlook beyond 2030. As 
the risk of stranded assets is prevalent with higher carbon emission prices than anticipated, sensitivity analyses have only been undertaken for such 
a downside scenario. If the IEA NZE 2050 outlook is applied, this would impact the recoverability of certain assets recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2023. This scenario is not representative of management's mid-price reasonable best estimate.
Sensitivity of carrying amounts to carbon emission costs as described below is under the assumption that all other factors in the value in use 
models used to calculate recoverability of carrying amounts remain unchanged. Changes to carbon emission costs are applied for Integrated Gas, 
Upstream and Chemicals and Products because of the potential impact on Shell's business. 
Applying the IEA NZE 2050 carbon price scenario to Integrated Gas assets of $72 billion (2022: $75 billion) and Upstream assets of $84 billion 
(2022: $88 billion), up to the end of life of these assets, shows recoverable amounts that are $2-4 billion (2022: $2-5 billion) lower for Integrated 
Gas and up to $1 billion lower for Upstream than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. 
Applying the IEA NZE 2050 carbon price scenario to Chemicals and Products assets of $44 billion shows recoverable amounts that are $3-4 
billion lower than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023. For Chemicals and Products, increased carbon cost could however potentially 
be recovered partially through increased product sale prices.

4. Climate change and energy transition continued
Within Chemicals and Products, the assets potentially most sensitive to the energy transition are refineries. 
Portfolio composition and changes
Since 2016, Shell's Chemicals and Products portfolio has evolved, shifting from 15 refineries at the end of 2016 to eight at the end of 2023. During 
that period, Shell assumed the sole ownership of two refineries through the dissolution of the Motiva joint venture, and disposed of, converted 
or closed nine refineries. Further, during 2023 Shell agreed to sell one refinery (under assets held for sale at the end of 2023, see Note 18), 
announced the intention to sell the Singapore refining and chemicals assets and subsequently announced plans to repurpose the Rheinland 
refinery in Germany into a base oil manufacturing plant. The carrying amount of refineries decreased from $10 billion as at December 31, 2016, 
to less than $6 billion as at December 31, 2023. In line with Shell's strategy, Shell's refining footprint continues its transformation into energy and 
chemicals parks that will provide feedstocks for the chemicals and lubricants business, as well as other low-carbon energy products, including 
biofuels and hydrogen. This transformation will involve investments in assets within these energy and chemicals parks that will be recognised 
as separate cash-generating units and are expected to be resilient in the energy transition, and hence their carrying amounts may increase. 
Estimated useful life
Refineries in the Chemicals and Products segment (carrying amount as at December 31, 2023, $6 billion (2022: $6 billion)) may be impacted 
under a two-degrees-Celsius or less external climate scenario. 
For refineries in Chemicals and Products, depreciation of assets is on a straight-line basis over the life of the assets, starting at the date the asset 
becomes available for use, over a period of 20 years (see Note 2). Over the course of the energy transition, the current carrying amount of 
refineries will be fully depreciated, offset by anticipated investments in assets that are expected to be resilient in the energy transition as described 
above. Based on current depreciation of the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2023, and assuming no further investment, all refineries would 
be fully depreciated between four and 11 years. 
In addition to refineries, further assets of $38 billion include $25 billion of assets in relation to Chemicals. This includes $15 billion for the new 
Pennsylvania chemical plant, which started operations in November 2022 and being a more efficient plant, it is expected to be more resilient in 
the energy transition. Chemical products are not produced with the aim to combust and consequently do not generate GHG emissions. Under the 
IEA NZE 2050 scenario chemical production volumes are not expected to decrease towards 2050, compared with current levels and hence 
chemical assets are expected to be resilient through the energy transition.
Other assets of $13 billion include $8 billion of assets mainly related to storage tanks, vessels, terminals and depots in trading and supply that are 
also expected to be resilient in the energy transition. Another $3 billion of assets relates to oil sands. Based on production plans for oil sands 
assets, 82%, 57% and 32% of SEC proved reserves for oil sands as at December 31, 2023, would currently be left by 2030, 2040 and 2050, 
respectively. Taking into consideration the carrying amount as at December 31, 2023 and depreciation under the unit-of-production methodology, 
this provides a further perspective on the risk of stranded oil sands assets carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2023. 
Price sensitivities
Where available Shell uses external climate scenarios for sensitivity testing. In relation to chemical and refining margin forecasts, no credible 
climate scenarios have been identified and consequently sensitivity testing is performed by providing sensitivity to changes in margins. 
Chemical margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $252/tonne (20-year average). A change 
of -$30/tonne or +$30/tonne in long-term chemical margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in up to 
$2 billion impairment or no impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products (see Note 12).
Refining margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $7.6/bbl (20-year). A change of -$1/bbl or +
$1/bbl to the refining margin outlook over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in $1-2 billion impairment or up to $1 
billion impairment reversal respectively in Chemicals and Products (see Note 12).
Sensitivities to carbon prices are described in the section above.

Portfolio composition and changes
Assets in the Marketing segment are expected to be resilient through the energy transition with a change in the product mix as the energy 
transition progresses. The demand for products sold — such as chemicals, lubricants, biofuels, bitumen, electric vehicle charging and convenience 
retail -- is not expected to decrease and is expected to increase for a variety of these products in many markets. Shell is expanding networks of 
refuelling stations offering low-carbon fuels, including biofuels and various gaseous fuels, such as LNG and bio-LNG. As a result, the carrying value 
of these assets is not expected to be impacted by the energy transition or lower commodity price scenarios.

Other energy transition considerations
Discount rate sensitivity 
The discount rate applied for value in use impairment testing is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and is 
determined at 7.5% except for the power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment where 6% is applied. The discount rate 
includes generic systematic risk for energy transition risk. In addition, cash flow projections applied in individual assets include specific asset risks, 
including risk of transition. An increase in systematic climate risk could lead to a higher WACC and consequently to a higher discount rate to be 
applied in impairment testing. An increase of the discount rate applied for impairment testing of 1% under the assumption that all other factors 
(such as commodity prices, product margins and carbon prices) in the models used to calculate recoverability of carrying amounts remain 
unchanged would lead to a change in the carrying amount of $2-4 billion in Integrated Gas and Upstream, and up to $1 billion in Chemicals 
and Products, and no significant impairment in other segments.
Global oil and gas demand considerations 
A decrease in global demand and unchanged supply of oil and gas would likely lead to a decrease in price (see price sensitivity above). During 
2023 Shell's production of oil and gas accounted for 1.5% and 2% of total global production of oil and gas respectively. Changes in global oil 
and gas demand are therefore not expected to directly impact the ability to sell volumes of oil and gas produced by Shell at market prices. 
Deferred tax assets
In general, it is expected that sufficient deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable profits within the planning period of 10 years are available for 
recovery of the deferred tax assets recognised at December 31, 2023. Integrated Gas and Upstream deferred tax assets recognised are expected to 
be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of $241 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: $303 million) 
this period extends beyond 10 years. Deferred tax assets in Chemicals and Products and in Marketing expected to be recovered in more than 10 
years (between 11 and 20 years) are $455 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: $382 million) for which the forecasted taxable profits to 
determine recoverability have been risked. (See Note 22). 
Decommissioning and other provisions
The energy transition may result in decommissioning and restoration occurring earlier than expected. The risk on the timing of decommissioning 
and restoration activities for Integrated Gas and Upstream fields is limited, supported by production plans in the foreseeable future (see 
"Estimated useful life" above). Acceleration of decommissioning and restoration activities has also been reflected in the assessment of the 
appropriate discount rate. In 2021, the discount rate was revised from a 30-year to a 20-year term in line with the average remaining life of 
Integrated Gas and Upstream assets. On an undiscounted basis the provision for decommissioning and restoration as at December 31, 2023 
was $33 billion (2022: $33 billion), recognised on a discounted basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2023 at $19 billion 
(2022: $20 billion). Sensitivity to changes in the discount rate is provided in Note 24.
Historically, in Chemicals and Products, it was industry practice not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with 
manufacturing facilities. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefinite lives, so it was considered remote that an 
outflow of economic benefits would be required. In 2020, Shell considered the changed macroeconomic fundamentals, together with Shell's plans 
to rationalise the Group's manufacturing portfolio. Shell also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not to recognise decommissioning and 
restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities. Since 2020, decommissioning and restoration provisions are recognised for certain shorter-lived 
manufacturing facilities (see Notes 24 and 31). The energy and chemicals parks are considered longer-lived facilities that are expected to be 
resilient in the energy transition, and decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away.
Onerous contracts
Closure or early termination of activities may lead to supply contracts becoming onerous. Onerous contract provisions (see Note 24) have been 
recognised as at December 31, 2023, to reflect changes in expected future utilisation of certain assets. These include contracts in relation to 
unused terminals and refineries. The total carrying amount of the provision for onerous contracts as at December 31, 2023 was $1.1 billion (2022: 
$1.5 billion) principally related to contracts in relation to unused terminals and refineries.
Dividend resilience
External stakeholders have requested disclosures on how climate change affects dividend-paying capacity. If a further impairment had been 
recognised in 2023 using any of the climate change scenarios described above, this would not have impacted the ability to pay dividends in 
this financial year because of strong cash flow generation and financial reserves. Had Shell applied the IEA NZE50 scenario (see above), and if 
this had led to a decrease in the recoverable amount of Integrated Gas and Upstream assets of $18-25 billion and recognition of an equivalent 
impairment, this would not have impacted the distributable reserves available to Shell from which to pay dividends in 2023. This is on the basis 
that such impairment would have resulted in part-realisation of the merger reserve recognised by the Company of $234 billion
as at December 31, 2023.
A forward-looking statement regarding future dividend-paying capacity cannot be provided because of unknown risks and uncertainties that 
could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.

Physical risks
Mitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, is considered and embedded in the design and construction of Shell's 
projects, and/or operation of Shell's assets to minimise the risk of adverse incidents to Shell's employees and contractors, the communities where 
Shell operates, and Shell's equipment. The potential impact of physical changes comes from both acute and chronic physical risks. Acute risks, such 
as flooding and droughts, wildfires and more severe tropical storms, and chronic risks, such as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, could 
potentially impact some of Shell's facilities, operations and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards and impacts is expected to increase in 
certain high-risk locations. Extreme weather events, whether or not related to climate change, could have a negative impact on Shell's earnings, 
cash flows and financial condition.
In 2023 Shell carried out a detailed review to assess the impact of a range of changing climatic conditions including changes in temperature, 
precipitation, wind and sea levels across segments and geographies for our significant assets. Shell used IPCC climate modelling data covering 
three future climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) across the time-horizons 2025, 2030 and 2050. In the short to medium term, the 
risks were found to be related to factors that Shell is already aware of (whether or not related to climate change) and the assets are actively 
managing to mitigate, e.g. hurricane impacts in the US Gulf Coast, rising air temperatures in the Middle East and water scarcity in Europe and 
Asia. As an example, in recent years the Rhine river in Europe has seen historic lows during the summer months leading to challenges in the use of 
barges for transportation of our products. Dredging of harbours and investment in shallower-draft barges have helped to mitigate the risk. In the 
long term, the results of the exercise indicated that while we have evaluated against current known risk factors and our current asset portfolio, the 
frequency and severity of the identified risk factors may increase by 2050. The level of predictability is such that the need for investment in climate 
adaptation measures at the assets is not immediate and the results mean we are in a position to monitor the assets and determine whether there is 
any need for adaptation action, e.g. the impact of potential water scarcity on various assets. Shell tested over 70% of the carrying amount of 
Shell's physical assets as at December 31, 2022, to assess the potential impact of climate-related changes on Shell's significant assets. 13% (based 
on the carrying value) of physical assets tested are considered to be exposed to climate-related physical risks in the short to medium term which 
the assets are already actively managing to mitigate. In addition, we reviewed significant acquisitions made in 2023 of which none are 
considered to be exposed to climate-related physical risks in the short to medium term. Shell's plan reflects the impact of mitigating actions in the 
short to medium term. Shell will continue to monitor and assess the future exposure of Shell's assets in the longer term to changing climatic 
conditions to establish the need for any further adaptation actions and related metrics.
Additionally, the impact of physical climate change on Shell's operations is unlikely to be limited to the boundaries of Shell's assets. The overall 
impact, including how supply chains, resource availability and markets may be affected, also needs to be considered for a holistic assessment 
of this risk. Shell's assets manage this risk as part of broad risk and threat management processes as required by Shell's HSSE & SP Control 
Framework part of the wider Shell Performance Framework.

5. Emission schemes and related environmental programmes
Emission trading and related schemes
In general, emission trading schemes (ETS) are mandated governmental schemes to control emission levels and enhance clean energy transition, 
allowing for the trading of emission certificates. In most ETS, governments set an emission cap for one or more sectors. Generally, entities in scope 
of the scheme are allowed to buy emission certificates to cover shortages or sell surplus emission certificates. In certain countries, emissions are 
priced through a carbon tax. For Shell, the most significant carbon pricing mechanisms are established in Europe, Canada and Singapore.
Biofuel programmes
Biofuel programmes are mandated governmental schemes that set binding national targets on the share of renewables in fuel consumption 
or measures on reducing GHG emissions by fuel suppliers. Biofuels are blended with existing fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, to reduce net 
emissions. The share of biofuels in the total sales mix of fuel is used to comply with regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by the blending 
of biofuels in refineries and/or distribution depots (self-blending), through import of biofuels (for jurisdictions that grant biofuels certificates at the 
point of import) or by the purchasing of certificates from third parties (for jurisdictions that have a tradable biofuel certificates mechanism). Biofuel 
programmes also include regulatory requirements to pay a levy for the combustion of fossil fuels, based on CO₂ emitted – mainly related to the 
German Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) which has applied since January 1, 2021. 
Renewable power programmes
Renewable power programmes create a financial incentive to consume power that is sourced from renewable origins or require that a minimum 
percentage of power sold meets the green definition of the relevant standard. These regulations are typically accompanied by schemes supporting 
investments in the renewable technology. Renewable power programmes generally use certificates to monitor compliance, where renewable 
power certificates are granted for each MWh of energy generated that meets the predefined renewable criteria. Shell's compliance obligation 
under renewable power programmes comes primarily from energy supply and results from regulations applying in Europe, North America 
and Australia.

[A] Emission certificates that were allocated free of charge at an equivalent fair value at grant date.
Environmental certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are recognised at cost under other intangible assets (see Note 10). 
In addition, a portfolio of environmental certificates is held for trading purposes and classified under inventory (see Note 2 and Note 16). 
Environmental certificates held for trading purposes can be redesignated for compliance purposes and then used to settle compliance obligations.
Cost recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents the compliance cost associated with emissions or with products sold during 
the year. The liability at year-end represents the compliance cost recognised over current and past compliance periods to the extent not settled 
to date. Liabilities are settled in line with compliance periods, which depend on the scheme and may not coincide with the calendar year. 
The figures present compliance schemes only, excluding voluntary activities.

7. Segment information
General information 
Shell is an international energy company engaged in the principal aspects of the energy and petrochemicals industries and reports its business 
through segments: Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, Renewables and Energy Solutions, and Corporate. 
The Integrated Gas segment includes liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products. It 
includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver 
these to market. The segment also includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of LNG, including LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles.
The Upstream segment includes exploration and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil 
and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to the market.
The Marketing segment comprises the Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors & Decarbonisation businesses. The Mobility business operates Shell's 
retail network, including electric vehicle charging services. The Lubricants business produces, markets and sells lubricants for road transport, 
and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and construction. The Sectors & Decarbonisation business sells fuels, 
speciality products and services, including low-carbon energy solutions, to a broad range of commercial customers, including the aviation, marine, 
and agricultural sectors.
The Chemicals and Products segment includes chemicals manufacturing plants, with their own marketing network, and refineries, which turn crude 
oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products which are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. 
The segment also includes the pipeline business, trading and optimisation of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and oil sands activities 
(the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into synthetic crude oil).
The Renewables and Energy Solutions segment includes renewable power generation, the marketing and trading and optimisation of power 
and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits, and digitally enabled customer solutions. The segment also includes production and marketing 
of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon capture and storage hubs, investment in nature-based projects that avoid or reduce carbon 
emissions, and Shell Ventures, which invests in companies that work to accelerate the energy and mobility transformation.
The Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting Shell, comprising Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, its self-
insurance activities and its headquarters and central functions. All finance expense and income and related taxes are included in Corporate 
segment earnings rather than in the earnings of business segments.

7. Segment information continued
Basis of segmental reporting
Sales between segments are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially available prices. Third-party revenue and non-current assets 
information by geographical area are based on the country of operation of the Group subsidiaries that report this information. Separate disclosure 
is provided for the UK as this is the Company's country of domicile. 
Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings). On this basis, the purchase price of volumes sold during the 
period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings therefore exclude 
the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. CCS earnings attributable to Shell plc shareholders is the earnings measure 
used by the Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. 
Finance expense and income related to core financing activities, as well as related taxes, are included in the Corporate segment earnings rather 
than in the earnings of the business segments.
Information by segment on a current cost of supplies basis is as follows:

Discount rate and other assumptions
The discount rates applied in determining value in use reflect a current market assessment of the time value of money, adjusted for risks not 
included in forecast cash flows. The discount rate applied is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), derived from 
the following key assumptions:
[A] The peer group of comparable energy companies is tailored to reflect relevant integrated power companies (for power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment) and 
integrated oil and gas companies (for the rate applied to all other assets). The proportion of debt and equity in the WACC calculation reflects a target gearing ratio, tailored for power 
activities and oil and gas activities as appropriate.
This rate is reassessed throughout the reporting period, with adjustments made when changes in assumptions applied would lead to a change 
in an investor's expected rate of return on a portfolio of similar assets. This assessment considers a range of factors, including macroeconomic 
forecasts, the historical volatility of key assumptions and the level of risking reflected in cash flow forecasts, including the extent to which systemic 
risks have been reflected in Shell's Operating Plan, which forms the basis of forecast cash flows in determining value in use. 
Cash flow projections used in the determination of value in use were made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply 
and demand, forecast expenditures, potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions, product margins including forecast refining 
margins, chemical margins and expected production volumes (see Note 2). The level of risking reflected in these assumptions is a consideration 
in management's assessment of the discount rate to be applied in order to avoid duplication of systemic and asset-specific risking in calculating 
value in use, and to ensure the discount rate applied is commensurate with risks included in forecast cash flows.
The discount rate increased in 2023, predominantly as a result of sustained increases in US Treasury yields. The discount rate applied was a 
nominal post-tax WACC of 6% (2022: 5%) for the power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment and a nominal post-tax 
WACC of 7.5% (2022: 6.5%) for all other businesses.

12. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets continued
Recoverable value was predominantly assessed by reference to value in use. The pre-tax discount rates applied for value in use impairment 
testing vary according to the characteristics of the asset, including its useful life and cash flow profiles. The weighted average pre-tax discount 
rate applied in the recognition of impairment charges during the year was 9.9% for the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment and 12.9% 
for all other businesses. Prior year impairment charges were predominantly related to the withdrawal from Russia where value in use calculations 
were not applicable.
The near-term commodity price assumptions applied in impairment testing were as follows:
Commodity price assumptions [A]
2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Brent crude oil ($/b)  70  70  70  74 
Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu)  4.00  4  4  4 
2022 2023 2024 2025 2026
Brent crude oil ($/b)  80  70  70  71 
Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu)  4.00  3.50  3.50  3.98 
[A] Money of the day.
For periods after 2027, the real-terms price assumptions applied were: $70 per barrel (/b) (2022: $65/b) for Brent crude oil, $4.00 per million 
British thermal units (/MMBtu) (2022: $4.00/MMBtu) for Henry Hub natural gas. 
Oil and gas price assumptions applied for impairment testing are reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted on a periodic basis. Reviews include 
comparison with available market data and forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, 
policy measures and, in supply, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply, and behaviour of major 
resource holders. 
For certain assets in the Chemicals and Products and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments, the recoverable value was determined by 
reference to fair value less costs of disposal. In determining fair value, adjustments are made to forecast cash flows to reflect assumptions used 
by market participants. These adjustments predominantly relate to the discount rate applied and commodity price assumptions. For certain assets 
in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment, the valuation methodology incorporates other adjustments to reflect comparable transactions. 
The total carrying value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2023 for which recoverable 
value was determined by reference to fair value less costs of disposal was $2.6 billion related to assets in Renewables and Energy Solutions and 
$2.5 billion in Chemicals and Products. The weighted average post-tax discount rate applied to impairments recognised during the year is 12% for 
Renewables and Energy Solutions and 10% for Chemicals and Products.
Goodwill
Goodwill impairments of $635 million in 2023 are mainly recognised in Renewables and Energy Solutions primarily related to an asset in 
North America, triggered by annual goodwill impairment testing reflecting factors including the impact of the deteriorated macro environment. 
Property, plant and equipment
Exploration and production
Impairment losses recognised in Exploration and production in 2023 of $4,820 million related to various assets in Integrated Gas ($3,472 
million) and Upstream ($1,348 million). Impairments recognised in Integrated Gas mainly related to an asset located in North America, triggered 
by a change in the discount rate applied, and a project in Australia, triggered by factors including revised production estimates and regulatory 
changes. Impairment losses recognised in Upstream principally relate to projects in North America, Nigeria and the UK triggered by factors 
including revised reserves estimates and portfolio choices.
Manufacturing, supply and distribution
Impairment losses recognised in Manufacturing, supply and distribution in 2023 of $2,785 million mainly related to chemical assets in Singapore 
in Chemicals and Products, triggered by lower expected chemical margins and associated with portfolio choices.
Other
Other impairment losses in 2023 of $577 million related to various assets in Marketing ($292 million) and assets in Renewables and Energy 
Solutions mainly in Europe ($273 million).
Impairment reversals in 2023 of $627 million are mainly triggered by the reassessment of fair value less costs of disposal in Integrated Gas
($325 million) and revised reserves estimates in Upstream ($203 million).
Impairment losses in 2022 mainly related to the withdrawal from Russia ($854 million), the classification of an Upstream asset as held for sale 
($320 million) and an impairment of capital expenditure additions in fully impaired sites in Chemicals and Products ($257 million).

12. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets continued
The recognition of impairment reversals in 2022 was mainly triggered by the revision of Shell's mid- and long-term commodity price assumptions 
reflecting the energy market demand and supply fundamentals. They are related to: i) Integrated Gas for $3,449 million, mainly relating to the 
Queensland Curtis LNG asset; and ii) Upstream for $2,504 million, mainly related to two offshore projects in Brazil and an asset in the US Gulf of 
Mexico.
Impairment losses in 2021 were predominantly triggered by reclassifications of assets held for sale and portfolio developments. They were mainly 
related to three refineries in the USA within Chemicals and Products impaired on classification as held for sale ($1,537 million), and exploration 
and evaluation assets both within Integrated Gas ($600 million) and Upstream ($373 million).
Sensitivities
The main sensitivities in relation to value in use impairment assessment are the commodity price assumptions in Integrated Gas and Upstream, 
refining and chemical margins in Chemicals and Products, and discount rates in all segments.
Commodity price assumptions
A change of -10% or +10% in the commodity price assumptions over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in 
$5-8 billion impairments or $2-5 billion impairment reversal, respectively, in Integrated Gas and Upstream. 
Refining margins
Refining margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $7.6/bbl. A change of -$1/bbl or +$1/bbl
in long-term refining margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in $1-2 billion impairments or up to $1 billion 
impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products. 
Chemical margins
Chemicals margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $252/tonne. A change of -$30/tonne or +
$30/tonne in long-term chemical margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in up to $2 billion impairments or 
no impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products. 
Discount rates
A change of +1% in the discount rate would ceteris paribus result in $2-4 billion impairments in Integrated Gas and Upstream, and up to
$1 billion in Chemicals and Products, and would have no significant impact in other segments. 
Where carrying values have been supported by reference to fair value less costs of disposal, recoverable amounts are less sensitive to Shell's 
planning assumptions. This is on the basis that key assumptions (including discount rates and commodity prices) have been adjusted to reflect 
those used by market participants. 
In calculating recoverable value, key assumptions are not determined in isolation, to ensure relevant interdependencies are appropriately 
reflected. In particular, management considers the relationship between discount rates, forecast commodity prices and cash flow risking to ensure 
impairment testing assumptions result in an implicit expected return which is balanced and appropriate for the asset under review. Each of the 
sensitivities described above have been tested under a ceteris paribus assumption where all other factors remain unchanged, and as such do 
not reflect the potential offsetting effects of corresponding changes in other assumptions.

The fair value of financial assets included above approximates the carrying amount and was determined from predominantly unobservable inputs. 
Other receivables at December 31, 2023, included receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint arrangement partners of 
$296 million (2022: $717 million), after provisions for impairments, that are overdue in part or in full. Recoverability and timing thereof are subject 
to uncertainty, however, the ultimate risk of default on the carrying amount is considered to be low. Other receivables at December 31, 2023, 
also included current income tax receivables of $558 million (2022: $363 million) and non-current income tax receivables of $568 million 
(2022: $469 million).
Current prepayments and deferred charges at December 31, 2023, mainly decreased compared to prior year due to lower gas and power prices 
and a lower outstanding collateral position.
Provisions for impairments deducted from trade and other receivables amounted to $1,251 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: $1,510 million).
Allowance for expected credit losses - trade receivables
Shell uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables. The provision matrix is initially based on Shell's 
historical observed default rates. Shell calculates the ECL to adjust the historical credit loss experienced with forward-looking information.
The ECL at December 31, 2023, was $185 million (2022: $214 million), which represents 0.51-0.54% (2022: 0.45-0.54%) of all 
trade receivables. 
A loss allowance provision of $415 million (2022: $841 million) was established in addition to all other impairments to trade receivables
as at December 31, 2023, that are outside of the provision matrix calculations. 
Lease receivables
Lease contracts where Shell is the lessor are classified as finance leases or operating leases. Receivables for lease contracts classified as finance

Net debt is the sum of current and non-current debt, less cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
used to hedge the volatility caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. 
Net debt is a non-GAAP measure, providing additional information to help demonstrate the economic impacts of debt, associated hedges,

20. Debt continued
Shell has access to international debt capital markets via two commercial paper (CP) programmes, a Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme 
and a US universal shelf (US shelf) registration. Issuances under the CP programmes are supported by a committed credit facility and cash. 
Under the CP programmes, Shell can issue debt of up to $10,000 million with maximum maturities ranging between 183 days and 364 days 
depending on the form of the notes issued; and $10,000 million with maturities not exceeding 397 days.
The EMTN programme is updated each year, most recently in November 2023. During 2023, no debt was issued under this programme
(2022: no debt issued).
The US shelf registration provides Shell with the flexibility to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants. 
The registration is updated once every three years and was last updated in December 2023. During 2023, no debt was issued under the US 
shelf registration (2022: no debt issued).
On December 13, 2019, Shell refinanced its revolving credit facilities (RCF), which are linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), at 
pre-agreed margins. In December 2023, Shell extended the short-dated tranche of the facility of $1,920 million until December 2024. The facility 
retains a further one-year bank extension option, taking final maturity to 2025. The additional RCF tranche is $8,000 million expiring in 2026 
(2022: $320 million expiring in 2025 and $7,680 million expiring in 2026). The terms and availability are not conditional on Shell's financial 
ratios nor its financial credit ratings. The interest and fees related to these facilities are linked to Shell's progress towards reaching its short-term 
Net Carbon Intensity target.
The following tables compare contractual cash flows for debt, excluding lease liabilities at December 31, with the carrying amount in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contractual amounts reflect the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates; differences from carrying amounts 
reflect the effects of discounting, premiums and, where fair value hedge accounting is applied, fair value adjustments. Interest is estimated 
assuming that interest rates applicable to variable-rate debt remain constant and there is no change in aggregate principal amounts of debt 
other than repayment at scheduled maturity, as reflected in the table.

the prices quoted for those securities. The difference between the fair value of debt and the carrying amount is predominantly related to fixed 
rate debt.

[A] Future cash outflows in respect of leases may differ from lease liabilities recognised due to future decisions that may be taken by Shell in respect of the use of leased assets. These decisions 
may result in variable lease payments being made. In addition, Shell may reconsider whether it will exercise extension options or termination options, which are not reflected in the lease 
liabilities. There is no exposure to these potential additional payments in excess of the recognised lease liabilities until these decisions have been taken by Shell.

Adjustments in respect of prior periods relate to events in the current period and reflect the effects of changes in rules, facts or other factors 
compared with those used in establishing the current tax position or deferred tax balance in prior periods. 
Adjustments in respect of changes in tax rates and legislation in 2022 principally relate to the introduction of the UK Energy Profits Levy Act 2022 
(EPL) on July 14, 2022.
On December 20, 2021, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS released the Pillar Two Model Rules aimed to address the tax challenges 
of the digitalisation of the economy. The Pillar Two rules are designed to ensure large multinational enterprises (meeting certain conditions) pay 
a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate. On June 20, 2023, the UK substantively enacted Pillar Two. 
Shell has established a Group-wide Pillar Two Project, with oversight from senior executives, to prepare and implement these new tax rules.
Shell has applied the exception, as set out in the amendments to IAS 12, to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets 
and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The adoption of Pillar Two by the jurisdictions in which Shell operates is not expected to have 
a significant impact (see also Note 2).

22. Taxation continued
Other movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities relates to acquisitions, sales of non-current assets and businesses.
The deferred tax category Other primarily includes deferred tax positions in respect of leases, financial assets and liabilities, inventories, intangible 
assets other than goodwill and investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
The deferred tax category Property, plant and equipment also includes deferred tax positions in respect of investments in partnerships in the USA 
which are considered pass-through entities by its parent for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets of $6,454 million (2022: $7,815 million) are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will 
be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to be recovered, and a judgement as to whether or not there will 
be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets. It is considered probable based on business forecasts that such taxable profits will be 
available. For Marketing, as well as Chemicals and Products, additional judgement is required; in some jurisdictions the assessment of forecasted 
taxable profits resulting in deferred tax asset recognition of $455 million (2022: $382 million) extends for an additional 10 years beyond Shell's 
regular 10-year planning horizon. In those situations, additional risking has been applied to the forecast of taxable profits. For Integrated Gas and 
Upstream, deferred tax assets recognised are expected to be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of 
$241 million (2022: $303 million) as at December 31, 2023, this period extends beyond 10 years. 
The amount of deferred tax assets which are dependent on future taxable profits not arising from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, 
and which relate to tax jurisdictions where Shell has suffered a loss in the current or preceding year, was $2,027 million at December 31, 2023 
(2022: $4,202 million). The decrease compared with 2022 is primarily attributable to the utilisation of deferred tax assets in 2023 and a higher 
number of entities which have generated profit in both the current and preceding year.

Unrecognised taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed retained earnings of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates amounted to $5,311 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: $5,521 million). These retained earnings are subject to withholding tax upon 
distribution.
Excluding unrecognised tax losses for PRRT, the unrecognised deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward 
amounted to $28,460 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: $32,491 million), and included amounts of $25,489 million (2022: $28,199 million) 
that are subject to time limits for utilisation of five years or later, or are not time limited. 
23. Retirement benefits 
Retirement benefits are provided in most of the countries where Shell has operational activities. Shell offers these benefits through funded 
and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The most significant pension plans are in the Netherlands, UK and USA. 
Other post-employment benefits (OPEB) comprising retirement health care and life insurance are also provided in certain countries. The most 
significant OPEB plan is in the USA.

Characteristics of significant defined benefit and defined contribution plans and regulatory framework
The Netherlands
The principal defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands is a funded career-averaged pension arrangement with retired employees drawing 
benefits as an annuity, with a surplus of $3,520 million reported as at December 31, 2023, (2022: $3,378 million surplus). While the plan was 
closed to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 2013, it currently remains open for ongoing accrual for existing active members. Active members 
account for 23% (2022: 23%) of the total defined benefit liability in the Netherlands. From July 1, 2013 onwards, new employees in the 
Netherlands are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan. 
In line with Dutch regulations, the defined benefit pension plan has a joint Trustee Board with trustee representatives nominated by the Company, 
the Central Staff Council and retired members. The defined benefit pension plan also has an Accountability Council comprised of members 
nominated by the Company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. Furthermore, there is a Supervisory Committee, which includes 
external experts from the pension industry, to oversee management, compliance and operations of the fund. The defined contribution pension 
plan has a one-tier Trustee Board with an independent chair, trustee representatives nominated by the Company and the Central Staff Council, 
as well as two executive board members. The defined contribution fund also has an Accountability Council comprised of members nominated 
by the Company and the Central Staff Council. Both Trustee Boards are responsible for administering the plans in line with the Dutch "Pensioen 
Wet" (PW), including corporate governance, investment strategy for the pension plans' assets and paying member benefits, and are required 
to act in the best interests of the members.
As per July 1, 2023, new pension legislation ("Wet Toekomst Pensioenen") came into effect in the Netherlands which needs to be implemented 
latest January 2028. This legislation aims to create a more resilient and adaptable pensions system that can better accommodate demographic 
changes and economic fluctuations while providing adequate retirement income. The legislation requires all future pension accruals to be in a 
defined contribution framework and also intends that benefits accrued in pension funds are converted into a defined contribution framework. The 
new regulatory framework will have an impact on both the defined benefit pension plan and the defined contribution pension plan. The necessary 
changes to the pension plans require Central Staff Council consent and acceptance by the Trustee Boards of the pension plans. It is our 
expectation that consent will be obtained during 2024 and that following this, a transition plan will be offered to the Trustee Boards for 
acceptance. Shell will continue to monitor and take appropriate actions when and as necessary, as required by the law. There remains a 
degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome and impact on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial position.
UK
The three largest defined benefit pension plans for employees in the UK are funded final salary pension arrangements with retired employees 
mainly drawing benefits as an annuity with the option to take a portion as a lump sum. The three plans are separate and independent plans 
and cannot be netted against each other. In total, the plans reported a surplus of $3,246 million as at December 31, 2023 (2022: surplus of 
$4,172 million), which is after netting of unfunded plans of $340 million (2022: $317 million) which are reported as non-current liabilities on the 
balance sheet. All three plans were closed to new employees hired or rehired. However, two plans currently remain open for ongoing accrual 
for existing active members. Active members account for 16% (2022: 17%) of the total defined benefit liability in the UK. From March 1, 2013, 
onwards new employees in the UK are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.
In line with UK regulations, the principal defined benefit pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of four trustee 
directors nominated by the Company, including the chair and four member-nominated trustee directors. The defined contribution pension plan is 
governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of three company-nominated directors, including the chair and two member-nominated 
trustee directors. The trustees are responsible for administering the plans in line with the Trust Deed and Regulations, including setting the investment 
strategy for the pension plans' assets and paying member benefits, and are required to act in the best interests of the members of the pension plans.
USA
The principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA is a funded final average pay pension plan with a surplus of $140 million reported as at 
December 31, 2023 (2022: $318 million surplus). After retirement, all retirees can choose to draw their benefits as an annuity, whereas others 
also have the choice to take their benefit in a lump sum. There is also an unfunded defined benefit pension plan with a deficit of $884 million 
(2022: $868 million deficit). The benefits under this plan are taken primarily in a lump sum. In addition, the Company provides a defined 
contribution benefit plan. The funded defined benefit, unfunded defined benefit, and Shell's defined contribution pension plans are subject 
to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Active members account for 23% (2022: 24%) of the total defined 
benefit liability in the USA.
Both the funded defined benefit pension plan and the defined contribution pension plan are governed by trustees who are appointed by the Plan 
Sponsor and are named fiduciaries with respect to the plans. The trustees are generally responsible for investment-related matters, appointing 
the Plan Administrator, maintaining general oversight and deciding appeals of participants.
In line with Shell group's strategic objectives and risk management, on January 30, 2024, the principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA, 
Shell Pension Plan, entered into a contract with "The Prudential Insurance Company of America" to settle $5,052 million of pension liabilities. The 
settlement price consisted of $4,920 million of pension assets. As a result of this transaction, all legal and constructive obligations for a tranche 
of benefits provided by the Shell Pension Plan have been eliminated. A gain on settlement of $101 million (after tax) will be recognised in Shell's 
Consolidated Statement of Income in 2024.

USA OPEB 
The Company also sponsors "other post-retirement employee benefits" (OPEB), mainly in the USA. The OPEB plans in the USA provide medical, 
dental and vision benefits, as well as life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the Company and retirees 
share the costs with a deficit of $2,267 million reported as at December 31, 2023 (2022: $2,135 million deficit). The plan that provides post-
retirement medical benefits in the USA is closed to employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Certain life insurance benefits are 
paid by the Company.
Significant funding requirements: 
￮ Additional contributions to the Dutch defined benefit pension plan would be required if the 12-month rolling average local funding percentage 
falls below 105% for six months or more. At the most recent (2023) funding valuation, the local funding percentage was above this level. 
￮ There are no set minimum statutory funding requirements for the UK plans. A professional qualified independent actuary, appointed by the 
trustee board, undertakes a local funding valuation typically every three years. The most recent completed funding valuation for the principal 
defined benefit plan was undertaken as at December 31, 2020, and revealed a funding ratio of 103% and therefore no sponsor contributions 
(except for salary sacrifice contributions) were payable under the schedule of contributions. 
￮ Under the Pension Protection Act, US pension plans are subject to minimum required contribution levels based on the funding position.
No contributions are required based on the most recent funding valuation.
Associated risks to which retirement benefits are exposed
There are inherent risks associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. These risks are related to various assumptions made on valuation 
of the liabilities and the cash funding requirement of the underlying plans. Volatility in capital markets or government policies, and the resulting 
consequences for investment performance, interest and inflation rates, as well as changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or 
pensionable remuneration at retirement, could result in significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. In case of a shortfall, 
there could be a requirement to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations).
These inherent risks are managed by a pension forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell's pension strategy, policy 
and operations. The forum is supported by a risk committee in reviewing the results of the assurance process with respect to pension risk.
Investment strategies
Long-term investment strategies of plans are generally determined by the relevant pension plan trustees using a structured asset/liability 
modelling approach to define the asset mix that best meets the objectives of optimising returns within agreed risk levels, while maintaining 
adequate funding levels.
Principal and actuarial assumptions
The principal assumptions applied in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations and their bases were as follows: 
￮ rates of increase in pensionable remuneration, pensions in payment and health-care costs: historical experience and management's
long-term expectation;
￮ discount rates: prevailing long-term AA corporate bond yields, chosen to match the currency and duration of the relevant obligation; and 
￮ mortality rates: published standard mortality tables for the individual countries concerned adjusted for Shell experience where statistically 
significant. 
The weighted averages for those assumptions and related sensitivity information as at December 31, 2023 are presented below. Sensitivity 
information indicates by how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease 
with no change in other assumptions. The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as 
it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another. The weighted averages are at nominal terms and based on 
market expectations at December 31, 2023.

The amount and timing of settlement in respect of these provisions are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are not always within 
management's control. Reviews of estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs and the discount rate applied are carried out regularly. 
The discount rate applied at December 31, 2023, was 4.5% (2022: 3.25%). In 2023, there was a decrease of $2,916 million in total provisions 
due to the change in discount rate. Of this total, $2,777 million relates to a decrease in the decommissioning and restoration provision, partly 
offset by an increase resulting from changes in cost estimates of $1,340 million, reported within remeasurements and other movements. This net 
decrease is predominantly reflected in the carrying amount of the related asset.
An increase of 0.5% or a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate could result in a decrease of $0.9 billion (2022: $1.2 billion) or an increase of 
$1 billion (2022: $1.3 billion) in decommissioning and restoration provisions, respectively. Where applicable, the carrying amount of the related 
asset is to be tested for impairment. 
Other provisions at December 31, 2023, include amounts recognised in respect of employee benefits.

25. Financial instruments
Financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet include investments in securities (see Note 14), cash and cash equivalents (see Note 17), 
debt (see Note 20) and derivative contracts.
Risks
In the normal course of business, financial instruments of various kinds are used for the purposes of managing exposure to interest rate, foreign 
exchange and commodity price movements.
Treasury standards are applicable to all subsidiaries and each subsidiary is required to adopt a treasury policy consistent with these standards. 
These policies cover: financing structure; interest rate and foreign exchange risk management; insurance; counterparty risk management; and use 
of derivative contracts. Wherever possible, treasury operations are carried out through specialist regional organisations without removing from 
each subsidiary the responsibility to formulate and implement appropriate treasury policies.
Apart from forward foreign exchange contracts to meet known commitments, the use of derivative contracts by most subsidiaries is not permitted 
by their treasury policy.
Other than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative contracts is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that 
have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.
Shell's operations expose it to market, credit and liquidity risk, as described below.
Market risk
Market risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the prices of crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, 
chemical feedstocks, power and environmental certificates will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
Interest rate risk
Most debt is raised from central borrowing programmes. Shell's policy continues to be to have debt principally denominated in dollars and to 
maintain a largely floating interest rate exposure profile. However, Shell has issued a significant amount of fixed rate debt in recent years, taking 
advantage of historically low interest rates available in debt markets. As a result, the majority of the debt portfolio at December 31, 2023, is at 
fixed rates and this reduces Shell's adverse exposure to rising floating dollar interest rates (see Note 2). 
The financing of most subsidiaries is structured on a floating-rate basis, and any further interest rate risk management is only applied under 
exceptional circumstances. 
On the basis of the floating-rate net cash position at December 31, 2023, (both issued and hedged), and assuming other factors (principally 
foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further interest rate management action was taken, an increase 
in interest rates of 1% would have increased 2023 income before taxation by $226 million (2022: $234 million increase).
The carrying amounts and maturities of debt and borrowing facilities are presented in Note 20. Interest expense is presented in Note 9.
Foreign exchange risk 
Many of the markets in which Shell operates are priced, directly or indirectly, in dollars. As a result, the functional currency of most Integrated Gas 
and Upstream entities and those with significant cross-border business is the dollar. For Chemicals and Products entities, the functional currency is 
typically the local currency. Consequently, Shell is exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk: when an entity enters into transactions that 
are not denominated in its functional currency; when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date; and 
as a result of holding net investments in operations that are not dollar-functional. Each entity is required to adopt treasury policies that are 
designed to measure and manage its foreign exchange exposures by reference to its functional currency.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
276 Shell Form 20-F 2023

25. Financial instruments continued
Foreign exchange gains and losses arise in the normal course of business from the recognition of receivables and payables and other monetary 
items in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. Foreign exchange risk may also arise in connection with capital expenditure. For 
major projects, an assessment is made at the final investment decision stage of whether to hedge any resulting exposure. 
Assuming other factors (principally interest rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further foreign exchange risk management 
actions were taken, a 10% appreciation against the dollar at December 31 of the main currencies to which Shell is exposed would have the 
following effects:

Australian dollar  (129)  (65)  780  837 
Canadian dollar  9  (44)  1,392  1,575 
The above sensitivity information was calculated by reference to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at December 31 only. The effect on 
income before taxation arises in connection with monetary balances denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency; the 
effect on net assets arises principally from the translation of assets and liabilities of entities that are not dollar-functional. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses included in income are presented in Note 8.
Commodity price risk 
Certain subsidiaries have a mandate to trade crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and environmental 
certificates, and to use commodity derivative contracts (forwards, futures, swaps and options) as a means of managing price and timing risks 
arising from this trading activity. In effecting these transactions, the entities concerned operate within procedures and policies designed to ensure 
that risks, including those relating to the default of counterparties, are managed within authorised limits. A department that is independent from 
Shell's traders monitors market risk exposures daily.
Value-at-risk (VAR) techniques based on variance/covariance or Monte Carlo simulation models are used to make a statistical assessment of the 
market risk arising from possible future changes in market values for commodity positions held by these subsidiaries over a 1-day holding period 
and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions, the history of price movements 
and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is 
maintained. The VAR average and year-end positions in respect of commodities traded in active markets, which are presented in the table 
below, are calculated on a diversified basis in order to reflect the effect of offsetting risk within combined portfolios.
Value-at-risk (pre-tax)

Europe gas and power  31  12  54  40 
Australia gas and power  4  2  12  12 
Environmental certificates  9  4  10  13 
Furthermore, commodity derivative hedge contracts are used to partially mitigate price volatility on future LNG sales and purchases. 
As contracts to buy and sell physical LNG are accounted for on an accrual basis (see Note 2) and commodity derivatives are accounted for on a 
fair-value basis, this creates an accounting mismatch over periods. The fair value accounting of commodity derivatives can result in gains or losses 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
These derivative contracts are based on a mix of European and North American gas price indices, global crude price indices and Asian LNG price 
indices. In previous years, Shell has seen high volatility in these markets. On that basis, a sensitivity analysis has been performed for a 50% price 
increase or decrease of this basket of derivative contracts at year-end 2023, which would result in a gain or loss of $1.5 billion (pre-tax) in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income (2022: $2.7 billion), whereas the same sensitivity analysis applied to the average exposures for the period 
was $0.8 billion (2022: $2.5 billion).

Credit risk 
Policies are in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. These policies include credit 
analysis and monitoring of trading partners against counterparty credit limits. Credit information is regularly shared between business and finance 
functions, with dedicated teams in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration. Mitigation measures are defined and 
implemented for higher-risk business partners and customers, and include shortened payment terms, collateral or other security posting and 
vigorous collections. In addition, policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution. 
A defined portfolio credit risk appetite is in place to manage credit risk concentrations. It includes a set of thresholds and alerts set at different 
portfolio levels (e.g. country, industry sector, creditworthiness). Utilisation against these thresholds is actively monitored, and actions are taken 
to ensure compliance where appropriate. In 2023, there were no material concentrations of credit risk, with individual customers or 
geographically. In 2022, elevated commodity prices, mainly in relation to strategic long-term contracts in the gas portfolios resulted in a material 
concentration of risk representing around 25% of total Shell net credit exposure after offsetting for cash collateral and other instruments held.
Surplus cash is invested in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse 
repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or 
counterparty. Management monitors the investments regularly and adjusts the investment portfolio in light of new market information where 
necessary to ensure credit risk is effectively diversified.
In commodity trading, counterparty credit risk is managed within a framework approved by the CEO and CFO, and for which delegations are 
in place to other executives in the business. Credit limits are defined and their utilisation is regularly reviewed. Credit risk exposure is continuously 
monitored and the acceptable level of credit exposure is determined in accordance with the approved delegations. Credit checks are performed 
by a department independent of traders, and are undertaken before contractual commitment. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit 
insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage specific risks.
Shell routinely enters into offsetting, master netting and similar arrangements with trading and other counterparties to manage credit risk. Where 
there is a legally enforceable right of offset under such arrangements and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously, the net asset or liability is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, otherwise assets and liabilities are 
presented gross. These amounts, as presented net and gross within trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivative

The carrying amount of financial assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities at December 31, 2023, presented within trade 
and other receivables, was $3,437 million (2022: $11,133 million). The decrease in financial assets pledged as collateral is driven by the reduction 
in overall derivative exposure, mainly due to the decline in gas and power forward prices. The carrying amount of collateral held at December 31, 
2023, presented within trade and other payables, was $1,404 million (2022: $1,648 million). Collateral mainly relates to initial margins held with 
commodity exchanges and over-the-counter counterparty variation margins. Some derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby 
eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for Shell's business activities may not be available. Management believes that it has access 
to sufficient cash and cash equivalents, debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable 
requirements. Information about borrowing facilities is presented in Note 20.
Derivative contracts and hedges
Derivative contracts are used principally as hedging instruments. However, because hedge accounting is not always applied, movements in the 
carrying amounts of derivative contracts that are recognised in income may not be matched in the same period by the recognition of the income 
effects of the related hedged items.

Net gains before tax on derivative contracts, excluding those designed as hedges, were $5,189 million in 2023 (2022: $1,331 million gains; 
2021: $8,377 million losses). 
Certain contracts, mainly to hedge price risk relating to forecast commodity transactions, were designated in cash flow hedging relationships 
and are presented after the offset of related margin balances with exchanges. Contracts to hedge foreign exchange risks were also designated 
in cash flow hedging relationships and the net carrying amount of these contracts at December 31, 2023, was a liability of $373 million 
(2022: $828 million liability). See Note 28 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.
Certain interest rate and currency swaps were designated in fair value hedges, principally in respect of debt for which the net carrying amount 
of the related derivative contracts, net of accrued interest, at December 31, 2023, was a liability of $1,441 million (2022: $2,191 million liability). 
At December 31, 2023, no debt instruments (2022: €3 billion) were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, relating to the 
foreign exchange risk arising between certain intermediate holding companies and their subsidiaries. See Note 28 for the accumulated balance 
recognised within other comprehensive income.
In the course of trading operations, certain contracts are entered into for delivery of commodities that are accounted for as derivatives. 
The resulting price exposures are managed by entering into related derivative contracts. These contracts are managed on a fair value basis 
and the maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the undiscounted fair value of derivative liabilities. 
For a minority of commodity derivatives contracts, carrying amounts cannot be derived from quoted market prices or other observable inputs, 
in which case fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, such as Black-Scholes; option spread models; and extrapolation, using quoted 
spreads with assumptions developed internally based on observable market activity.
Other contracts include certain contracts that are held to sell or purchase commodities and others containing embedded derivatives, which 
are required to be recognised at fair value because of pricing or delivery conditions, even though they were entered into to meet operational 
requirements. These contracts are expected to mature in 2024-2025, with certain contracts having early termination rights (for either party). 
Valuations are derived from other observable inputs.

sterling deferred shares were treated as cancelled and the Company's issued share capital was reduced by the nominal value of the shares redeemed in accordance with section 688 
of the UK Companies Act 2006.
On January 29, 2022, as part of the Simplification announced on December 20, 2021, the Company's A and B shares were assimilated into 
a single line of ordinary shares. This is reflected in the above table.
At the Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 23, 2023, the Board was authorised to allot ordinary shares in the Company, and to 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into ordinary shares in the Company, up to an aggregate nominal amount of approximately 
€161 million (representing approximately 2,307 million ordinary shares of €0.07 each), and to list such shares or rights on any stock exchange. 
This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 22, 2024, and the end of the AGM to be held in 2024, unless previously 
renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting.

26. Share capital continued
At the May 23, 2023, AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase (i) up to 692 million ordinary shares "on-
market" (excluding any treasury shares), less the number of ordinary shares purchased or committed to be purchased in terms of the buyback 
contracts ("off-market"), made under the authority in (ii); and (ii) up to 692 million ordinary shares off-market, less any on-market purchases 
made under the authority in (i).
In the case of both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares, the minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for 
an ordinary share is €0.07 and the maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount 
equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid in relation to ordinary shares on the trading 
venues where the purchase is carried out. The authorities for both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares will expire at the 
earlier of the close of business on August 22, 2024, and the end of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2024. Ordinary shares purchased 
by the Company pursuant to these authorities will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are 
owned by the Company itself.

Dutch Petroleum Company and The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company, plc, now The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited, in 2005. 
The merger reserve increased in 2016 following the issuance of shares for the acquisition of BG Group plc. 
The capital redemption reserve was established in connection with repurchases of shares of the Company. 
The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 27). The movement comprises the net of the 
charge for the year and the release as a result of vested awards.

[B] Dividends paid on A shares totalled in 2021: $3,330 million and dividends paid on B shares totalled in 2021: $2,991 million.
On February 1, 2024, the Directors announced a further interim dividend in respect of 2023 of $0.3440 per ordinary share. The total dividend 
is estimated to be $2,230 million and is payable on March 25, 2024, to shareholders on the register at February 16, 2024.
Shareholders will be able to elect to receive their dividends in US dollars, sterling or euros.
30. Earnings per share
2023 2022 2021
Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders ($ million)  19,359 42,309 20,101
Weighted average number of shares used as the basis for determining:
Basic earnings per share (million of shares)  6,733.5  7,347.5  7,761.7 
Diluted earnings per share (million of shares)  6,799.8  7,410.5  7,806.8 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the income attributable to Shell plc shareholders for the year by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of shares outstanding excludes shares held in trust.
Diluted earnings per share are based on the same income figures. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is 
increased by dilutive shares related to share-based compensation plans. If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares could decrease diluted 
loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted 
earnings per share.
31. Legal proceedings and other contingencies
General
In the ordinary course of business, Shell subsidiaries are subject to a number of contingencies arising from litigation and claims brought by 
governmental authorities, including tax authorities, and private parties. The operations and earnings of Shell subsidiaries continue, from time to 
time, to be affected to varying degrees by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to the protection of the 
environment and indigenous groups in the countries where they operate. The industries in which Shell subsidiaries are engaged are also subject to 
physical risks of various types.
The amounts claimed in relation to such events and, if such claims against Shell were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in 
the various cases could be substantial. Based on information available to date and taking into account that in some cases it is not practicable to 
estimate the possible magnitude or timing of any resultant payments, management believes that the foregoing are not expected to have a material 
adverse impact on Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty around these contingencies, 
as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
In certain divestment transactions, liabilities related to decommissioning and restoration are de-recognised upon transfer of these obligations to the 
buyer. For certain of these obligations Shell has issued guarantees to third parties and continues to be liable in case the primary obligor is not able 
to meet its obligation. These potential obligations arising from issuance of these guarantees are assessed to be remote.
Decommissioning and restoration of manufacturing facilities
For long-lived manufacturing facilities, where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away, while there is a present obligation 
that has arisen from past events, the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. This is because the settlement dates are indeterminate; 
and other estimates, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, cannot be reliably determined. 
Consequently, the decommissioning and restoration obligation that exists for such long-lived manufacturing facilities cannot be reliably quantified 
and is disclosed as a contingent liability. There remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning such obligations and their potential effects on 
future operations, earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.

Pesticide litigation 
Shell USA, Inc. (Shell USA), along with another agricultural chemical pesticide manufacturer and several distributors, has been sued by public 
and quasi-public water purveyors, water storage districts and private landowners alleging responsibility for groundwater contamination caused by 
applications of chemical pesticides. There are approximately 24 such cases currently pending, four claims made but not yet filed, and an active 
subpoena for records. These matters assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, seeking to recover actual damages, including drinking 
well treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. While Shell USA continues to vigorously defend these actions, in 
January 2018 an environmental regulatory standard became effective in the State of California, where a majority of the suits are pending. The 
2018 standard requires public water systems state-wide to perform quarterly or monthly sampling of their drinking water sources for a chemical 
contained in certain pesticides. Water systems deemed out of compliance with the regulatory standard must take corrective action to resolve the 
exceedance or take the potable water source out of service. In response to this regulatory standard, Shell USA monitors the sampling results to 
determine the number of wells potentially impacted. Based on the claims asserted and Shell USA's history with regard to amounts paid to resolve 
varying actions, management does not expect the outcome of the matters pending at December 31, 2023, to have a material adverse impact on 
Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their 
potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
Climate change litigation
In the USA, energy companies (including Shell), industry associations, and others have been named in several matters alleging responsibility for 
the impacts of climate change due to the use of fossil fuels. These matters assert a number of different theories of liability for a wide variety of 
harms, including but not limited to, impacts to public and private infrastructure, natural resources, and public health and services. As of December 
31, 2023, 24 lawsuits naming Shell as a defendant were pending, three claims were filed but not yet served, and one petition to preserve 
testimony was pending. 
In the Netherlands, in a case against Shell brought by a group of environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) and individual 
claimants, the Court found that while Shell is not currently acting unlawfully, Shell must reduce the aggregate annual volume of CO2 emissions of 
Shell operations and energy-carrying products sold across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 45% (net) by the end of 2030 relative to its 2019 emissions levels 
(the "Dutch Court Order"). For Scopes 2 and 3, this is a significant best-efforts obligation. Shell appealed that ruling and a hearing is scheduled to 
take place before the Dutch Court of Appeal of The Hague in April 2024. 
Management believes the outcome of these matters should be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell, but there remains a high degree of 
uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's 
financial condition. 
NAM (Groningen gas field) litigation
Since 1963, NAM – a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50%:50%) – has been producing gas from the Groningen field, the largest 
gas field in Western Europe. After smaller tremors in the 1990s and the late 2000s, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale occurred 
in 2012, causing damage to properties in the affected area, and the area continues to experience tremor/earthquake-type events. NAM has 
successfully settled close to 80,000 claims for physical damage to property. The Dutch State has taken over the damage-claim-handling from 
NAM for all claim categories, and the strengthening operation in the region, while NAM remains financially responsible insofar as the costs 
corresponded to NAM's liability. In 2022, NAM started arbitrations with the Dutch government to have its financial liability determined for costs 
which the Dutch government compensated to claimants and subsequently charged to NAM. These claims include but are not limited to physical 
damage to property, housing value loss, emotional damage and loss of living enjoyment. 
Shell and ExxonMobil seek to reach a final, all-encompassing settlement with the Dutch government on the new design of the Dutch "Gasgebouw" 
and the wind-down of natural gas production in Groningen. Shell, ExxonMobil and the Dutch government reached agreements in 2018 (Heads of 
Agreement) and 2019 (Interim Agreement) and subsequently have been engaged in discussions on the interpretation and implementation of these 
agreements and on a final and all-encompassing settlement. As these discussions have not led to such a settlement, in December 2023, the NAM 
shareholders asked an independent arbitration panel to rule on the interpretation and implementation of the agreements made in 2018/2019. The 
purpose of this arbitration is for a neutral third party to assess the situation and provide clarity. The arbitration is expected to take several years 
and the judgement will be binding. The arbitration does not preclude a final and all-encompassing settlement, provided Shell, ExxonMobil and 
the Dutch government agree to pursue such a settlement.
There remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning the ultimate outcome of these disputes and their potential effect on future operations, 
earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.

Kazakhstan
Shell has several matters in dispute involving the Republic of Kazakhstan. One litigation matter involving a Shell NOV relates to a Sulphur 
permitting inspection outcome. An unfavourable ruling was issued by the Administrative Collegium of Astana City Court in February 2024. The 
Shell NOV is assessing its next steps, including filing an appeal to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court. 
The other matters are two Shell NOVs concerning disputes as to cost recovery for the period 2010 to 2019 under the applicable production 
sharing contracts. In March 2023, the Republic of Kazakhstan appointed its arbitrator in each of the disputes, formally starting the arbitration 
process. No Statement of Claim has been filed in either matter.

matters above or whether any payments will be due. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcomes, as well as the 
potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
Nigerian litigation
Shell subsidiaries and associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various environmental, non-environmental and contractual disputes brought 
in the courts of Nigeria and England. These disputes are at different stages in litigation, including at the appellate stage, where judgements have 
been rendered against Shell entities in some of these disputes. If taken at face value, the aggregate amount of these judgements could be seen 
as material. Management, however, believes that the outcomes of these disputes, once determined, will be favourable to Shell. However, there 
remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding these cases, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's 
financial condition.
OPL 245
On January 27, 2017, the Nigeria Federal High Court issued an Interim Order of Attachment for Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), pending 
the conclusion of the investigation of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd.'s (SNEPCO's) investment in the Nigeria oil block OPL 
245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block with regard to potential anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering 
laws. SNEPCO applied for and was granted a discharge of this order on constitutional and procedural grounds. Also in Nigeria, in March 2017, 
criminal charges alleging official corruption and conspiracy to commit official corruption were filed against SNEPCO, one then current now former 
Shell employee and third parties including ENI SpA and one of its subsidiaries. Those proceedings are in abeyance. In January 2020, criminal 
charges alleging disobeying direction of law related to tax waivers were filed in Nigeria against Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Ltd., SNEPCO, and third 
parties including Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (NAE). Those proceedings are ongoing. In March 2017, parties alleging to be shareholders of 
Malabu Oil and Gas Company Ltd. (Malabu) filed two actions to challenge the 2011 settlement and the award of OPL 245 to SNEPCO and an 
ENI SpA subsidiary by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Both actions are currently stayed awaiting the outcome of appeals filed against 
procedural decisions. Those appeal proceedings are ongoing. On May 8, 2018, Human Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) sought 
permission from the Federal High Court of Nigeria to apply for an order to direct the Attorney General of the Federation to revoke OPL 245 on 
grounds that the entire Malabu transaction in relation to the OPL is unconstitutional, illegal and void as it was obtained through fraudulent and 
corrupt practice. On July 3, 2019, the Nigerian Federal High Court upheld objections from SNEPCO and NAE and struck the lawsuit filed by 
HEDA. The suit was struck because of the statute of limitations and lack of jurisdiction to hear the matter. HEDA has appealed the judgement, 
which is ongoing.
On a separate OPL 245 matter, pre-trial criminal proceedings are pending against an individual who also did not work for or on behalf of Shell.
On July 21, 2022, the Dutch Public Prosecutor's office announced it had dismissed its investigation into bribery allegations related to OPL 245. 
On October 24, 2022, Re:Common, HEDA and The Corner House announced that they filed a complaint at the Court of Appeal in The Hague, 
pursuant to Article 12 of the Dutch Code for Criminal Procedure, challenging the decision by the Dutch Public Prosecutor to dismiss its investigation. 
There remains a high degree of uncertainty around the OPL 245 matters and contingencies discussed above, as well as their potential effect on 
future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. Accordingly, at this time, it is not possible to reliably estimate the possible 
obligations and timing of any payments. Any violation of anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering legislation could have a material 
adverse effect on Shell plc's earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

35. Post-balance sheet events
On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell its Nigerian onshore subsidiary The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
Limited (SPDC) for a consideration of $1.3 billion with additional cash payments up to $1.1 billion as well as further contingent payments. Under 
the agreed deal structure, economic performance accrues to the buyer with effect from December 31, 2021, however, Shell will continue to 
consolidate SPDC until control transfers at completion. At completion Shell will provide secured term loans of up to $1.2 billion and additional 
financing of up to $1.3 billion over future years. Completion of the transaction is subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and 
other conditions.
On January 30, 2024, the principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA, Shell Pension Plan, entered into a contract with "The Prudential 
Insurance Company of America" to settle $5,052 million of pension liabilities. The settlement price consisted of $4,920 million of pension assets. 
As a result of this transaction, all legal and constructive obligations for a tranche of benefits provided by the Shell Pension Plan have been 
eliminated. This transaction will have no significant impact on the Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet 
or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
On February 1, 2024, Shell announced the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback programme covering an aggregate contract term of 
approximately three months (the "programme"). The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. All shares 
repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that, subject to market conditions, the programme will be completed prior 
to the Company's first quarter 2024 results announcement, scheduled for May 2, 2024. The Company has entered into an arrangement with a 
single broker consisting of three irrevocable, non-discretionary contracts, to enable the purchase of ordinary shares.

About this section
The purpose of this section is to comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) "Extractive Activities – Oil and 
Gas (Topic 932)". Extractive activities for this purpose include exploration and production activities to extract oil, condensates, natural gas liquids, 
oil sands and natural gas from their natural reservoirs.
In Shell, extractive activities, or oil and gas exploration and production activities, are undertaken within the Integrated Gas, Upstream and 
the Chemicals and Products (includes oil sands) segments. Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of Integrated Gas, Upstream 
and Chemicals and Products activities, and exclude GTL, some LNG activities, trading and optimisation, as well as other non-extractive activities. 
As a result, the information in this extractive activities section is not suitable for modelling Shell's integrated businesses, for which we refer to the 
segment information. Full segment information to the Consolidated Financial Statements is available on pages 246-251.
The information set out on pages 291-309 is referred to as "unaudited" as a means of clarifying that it is not covered by the audit opinion of the 
independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Proved reserves
Proved reserves estimates are calculated pursuant to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules and the FASB's Topic 932. 
Proved reserves can be either developed or undeveloped. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4–10 (a) of Regulation S-X. 
We include proved reserves associated with future production that will be consumed in operations. 
Proved reserves shown are net of any quantities of crude oil or natural gas that are expected to be (or could be) taken as royalties in kind. Proved 
reserves outside North America include quantities that will be settled as royalties in cash. Proved reserves include certain quantities of crude oil or 
natural gas that will be produced under arrangements that involve Shell subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in risks and rewards but do not 
transfer title of the product to those entities. 
Subsidiaries' proved reserves at December 31, 2023, were divided into 76% developed and 24% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) 
basis. For the Shell share of joint ventures and associates, the proved reserves at December 31, 2023, were divided into 34% developed and 66% 
undeveloped on a boe basis. 
Proved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements. Shell's proved reserves volumes at December 31, 2023, present 
in agreements such as production-sharing contracts (PSC), tax/variable royalty contracts or other forms of economic entitlement contracts, where 
the Shell share of reserves can vary with commodity prices, were 2,095 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, and 10,443 thousand 
million standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas. 
Proved reserves cannot be measured exactly because estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement (see "Risk factors" on page 20 and 
our "Proved reserves assurance process" below). These estimates remain subject to revision and are unaudited supplementary information. 
Proved reserves assurance process
A central group of reserves experts, who on average have around 28 years' experience in the oil and gas industry, undertake the primary 
assurance of the proved reserves bookings. This group of experts is part of the Resources Assurance and Reporting (RAR) organisation within Shell. 
A Vice President with 38 years' experience in the oil and gas industry currently heads the RAR organisation. He is a member of the Society of 
Petroleum Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and holds a BA in mathematics from Oxford University and an MEng in Petroleum 
Engineering from Heriot-Watt University. The RAR organisation reports directly to an Executive Vice President of Finance, who is a member of the 
Upstream Reserves Committee (URC). The URC is a multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior representatives from the Finance, Legal, 
Integrated Gas and Upstream organisations. The URC reviews and endorses all major (larger than 20 million barrels of oil equivalent) proved 
reserves bookings and debookings and endorses the total aggregated proved reserves. Final approval of all proved reserves bookings remains 
with Shell's CEO, and all proved reserves bookings are reviewed by Shell's Audit and Risk Committee. The Internal Audit function also provides 
secondary assurance through audits of the control framework. 
Crude oil, natural gas liquids, synthetic crude oil and bitumen
Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic crude oil and bitumen at the end of the year; their share of 
the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the end of the year; and the changes in such reserves during the year are set out on pages 
292-295. Significant changes in these proved reserves are discussed below (except where specific disclosures are prohibited), where "revisions 
and reclassifications" are changes based on new information that resulted from development drilling, production history and changes in 
economic factors.

Natural gas
Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves of natural gas at the end of the year, their share of the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the 
end of the year, and the changes in such reserves during the years are set out on pages 296-299. Significant changes in these proved reserves
are discussed below (except where specific disclosures are prohibited).
Volumes are not adjusted to standard heat content. Apart from integrated projects, volumes of gas are reported on an "as-sold" basis. The price 
used to calculate future revenue and cash flows from proved gas reserves is the contract price or the 12-month average on "as-sold" volumes. 
Volumes associated with integrated projects are those measured at a designated transfer point between the upstream and downstream portions 
of the integrated project. Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel.

---- Page 301 ----
Standardised measure of discounted future cash flows 
The SEC Form 20-F requires the disclosure of a standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows, relating to proved reserves quantities 
and based on a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average sales price, calculated on a first-day-of-the-month basis, with cost factors based on those 
at the end of each year, currently enacted tax rates and a 10% annual discount factor. In our view, the information so calculated does not provide 
a reliable measure of future cash flows from proved reserves, nor does it permit a realistic comparison to be made of one entity with another 
because the assumptions used cannot reflect the varying circumstances within each entity. In addition, a substantial but unknown proportion of 
future real cash flows from oil and gas production activities is expected to derive from reserves which have already been discovered, but which 
cannot yet be regarded as proved.

Oil and gas exploration and production activities earnings
In Shell, extractive activities, or oil and gas exploration and production activities, are undertaken within the Integrated Gas, Upstream and 
Chemicals and Products segments. Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of Integrated Gas, Upstream and Chemicals 
and Products activities, and exclude GTL, some LNG activities, trading and optimisation, as well as other non-extractive activities.
The earnings disclosed in this "extractive activities" section are only a subset of Shell's total earnings and as a result are not suitable for modelling 
Shell's integrated businesses, for which we refer to the full segment earnings and descriptions of Integrated Gas, Upstream and Chemicals and 
Products. These are available on pages 40, 46 and 67 respectively. The earnings disclosed in this "extractive activities" section are not adjusted 
for items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges and charges for onerous contract provisions. Full segment information to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements is available on pages 246-251.
The results of operations for oil and gas producing activities are shown in the tables below. Taxes other than income tax include royalties in cash 
to governments, without option to pay in kind outside USA and Canada.

The EU Taxonomy
Introduction
Regulation EU 2020/852 (the "EU Taxonomy Regulation") is a 
classification system for determining when an economic activity 
can be considered environmentally sustainable according to 
European Union (EU) standards. It aims to encourage investment 
in a low-carbon economy by creating common definitions of 
sustainability and mandatory disclosures to help investors make 
informed decisions.
Non-financial companies screen their eligible activities against the 
taxonomy's technical criteria for environmental sustainability and 
minimum safeguards. This allows them to calculate the share of 
revenue (turnover), capital expenditure (capex) and operating 
expenditure (opex) that can be classified as aligned. 
Shell supports the EU's ambition to achieve net zero emissions, 
which aligns with our own target to become a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050. We report against the taxonomy 
voluntarily because we recognise the importance of increasing 
transparency about how companies are progressing in the energy 
transition, even if the regulation is still evolving. 
Reporting scope
The taxonomy's reporting scope covers Shell's global business, 
based on the financial consolidation boundary. Shell's eligible 
activities include elements of our chemicals, power generation and 
storage, hydrogen, biogas and biofuels, electric vehicle charging, 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nature-based solutions 
(NBS) businesses. Our remaining businesses are non-eligible. 
The taxonomy's reporting basis differs from that used in our financial 
statements, which are based on International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). 
For example, the taxonomy does not recognise our interests in 
equity-accounted joint ventures and associates, goodwill, feasibility 
expenses or integrated value chains. These and other differences 
result in lower reported turnover, capex and opex under the 
taxonomy compared with our other disclosures. 
Technical criteria
The taxonomy’s technical criteria recognise stringent levels of 
environmental performance rather than transitional steps or 
alternative pathways. The complexity of the criteria and their 
reliance on EU standards can make the criteria difficult to interpret 
and apply, especially for activities outside the EU. 
Eligible and aligned share of Shell's business
In 2023, Shell's eligible turnover was $8,445 million or 2.7% 
(2022: $11,986 million or 3.1%), capex was $6,032 million or 
19.2% (2022: $6,744 million or 20.9%) and opex was $1,382 
million or 25.9% (2022: $796 million or 16.1%). 
In 2023, our aligned turnover was $542 million or 0.2%, capex 
was $4,173 million or 13.3% and opex was $30 million or 0.6%, 
comparing with zero alignment reported in 2022. The increase in the 
alignment was attributable to further development of our approach 
to technical screening based on evolving market practices and the 
acquisition of a biogas business. Our taxonomy-aligned activities 
include elements of our hydrogen, wind, solar, battery storage, 
biogas and biofuels and EV charging business, excluding 
individual assets that are not currently aligned with the 
technical screening criteria. 
The taxonomy does not provide a complete picture of our low-carbon 
business. Nevertheless, we support efforts to improve the framework 
and advance climate-related disclosure more broadly. For more 
information, see "Our journey to net zero" on pages 80-113.

The taxonomy framework
The taxonomy establishes technical criteria for environmental 
sustainability across more than 150 economic activities and six 
environmental objectives. 
An activity is taxonomy-eligible if it is described in a delegated 
act adopted under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Such an activity 
is eligible regardless of whether it complies with the technical 
screening criteria. 
An activity is taxonomy-aligned if it contributes substantially to one 
or more environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of 
the other objectives, is carried out in compliance with minimum human 
and labour rights safeguards, and complies with the relevant technical 
screening criteria.
The EU has stated that the taxonomy will develop over time. It notes 
that the fact an activity is not recognised as substantially contributing 
to one of the EU's environmental objectives does not necessarily mean 
it is not sustainable, and that not all activities with the potential to make 
a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are yet 
included in the framework.
As a UK company with its registered office and headquarters in 
London, Shell plc is not currently subject to the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation. We expect to come into scope in 2024 via the EU's 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which extends 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation's reporting obligation to third-country 
issuers that are listed on European exchanges. 
Our eligibility and alignment
In 2023, Shell's eligible turnover was $8,445 million or 2.7% 
(2022: $11,986 million or 3.1%), capex was $6,032 million or 19.2% 
(2022: $6,744 million or 20.9%) and opex was $1,382 million or 
25.9% (2022: $796 million or 16.1%). 
Eligible turnover decreased by $3,541 million, mainly due to lower 
prices and lower demand for Chemicals products. Capex was 
comparable to capex reported in 2022. Lower capex for wind 
and solar was offset by an increase in capex for the biogas and 
biofuels businesses. Opex was higher by $586 million compared with 
2022, mainly driven by commencement of operations at the Shell 
Polymers Monaca polyethylene production facility in Pennsylvania.
In 2023, Shell's taxonomy-aligned turnover was $542 million or 0.2%, 
capex was $4,173 million or 13.3% and opex was $30 million or 0.6%. 
In 2022, Shell elected to report zero alignment for all economic 
activities due to uncertainty in the market about how to interpret 
various aspects of the technical criteria. Several activities were, 
however, assessed as close to aligned, including solar, wind, hydrogen, 
low-carbon road transport and renewable energy technology.
In 2023, five economic activities were assessed as taxonomy-aligned, 
including manufacture of hydrogen, electricity from wind, electricity 
from solar, storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon 
road transport. For a sixth activity, manufacture of biogas and biofuels, 
we assessed some elements of our activities as taxonomy-aligned and 
some as non-aligned.
We further developed our approach to technical screening based 
on evolving market practices and internal efforts to improve alignment 
with the technical screening criteria. For example, we carried out a 
review of physical climate risks for our eligible activities in line with the 
requirements of the Generic criteria for Do No Significant Harm to 
Climate Change Adaptation (Appendix A). Completion of this review 
made it possible to report several activities that were close to 
alignment in 2022 as aligned in 2023. 
Basis of preparation
Shell seeks to prepare its disclosure in accordance with Delegated 
Regulation EU 2021/2178 (the "Disclosures Delegated Act") as well 
as several Commission Notices containing answers to frequently asked 
questions about taxonomy reporting issued between 2021 and 2023.
Shell has adopted a three-step process to prepare its taxonomy 
disclosure: 
￮ we identify our eligible activities and map these to our assets and 
projects; 
￮ we screen those activities for alignment with the technical criteria 
and the minimum safeguards; and
￮ we calculate the metrics for eligibility and alignment, based on 
the screening results. 
Each step is discussed below. 
Identification of eligible activities
Shell has assessed its business against the economic activities 
qualifying for the taxonomy's six environmental objectives. These 
include the activities listed in Delegated Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the 
"Climate Delegated Act", as amended), the gas-related activities listed 
in Delegated Regulation EU 2022/1214 (the "Complementary Climate 
Delegated Act") and the activities listed in EU 2023/2486 (the 
"Environmental Delegated Act").

---- Page 313 ----
The taxonomy does not provide criteria for determining when an 
economic activity is in scope for reporting. According to EU guidance, 
an economic activity takes place when resources — such as capital, 
goods, labour, manufacturing techniques or intermediary products — 
are combined to produce specific goods or services. Based on this 
definition, Shell treats economic activities as in scope for reporting if 
they correspond to final goods or services offered for sale to customers, 
or if they are intended to be offered for sale in the future, based on 
current business plans. We do not report on factors of production 
or overheads, such as real estate or IT, since these do not represent 
a final good or service. We also do not report on activities which are 
immaterial to our results and are not intended to operate as stand-
alone businesses, such as sales of waste heat or electricity from 
refineries and chemical plants.
For 2023, we identified a total of 13 economic activities as eligible 
for reporting. The only addition to our activities since last year was 
Storage of electricity, which became an eligible activity due to the 
development of new power storage projects. Although we screen our 
activities against all applicable environmental objectives, the discussion 
of our performance against the technical screening criteria focuses 
on the climate mitigation objective.
Alignment screening
Shell has developed an internal process to assess its eligible activities 
for alignment with the technical screening criteria and minimum 
safeguards, based on our understanding of the requirements of 
the Disclosures Delegated Act.
For each eligible activity, we begin by identifying the assets in scope 
for reporting. An asset is typically a discrete element of physical plant 
or equipment that contributes to an economic activity, such as a 
chemical plant or a wind farm, or a project in development that is 
intended to become an asset in the future. 
Once the assets for each activity have been defined, we review the 
Substantial Contribution and Do No Significant Harm criteria and 
proceed to screen the assets. Screening is carried out by subject 
matter experts and subject to cross-checking at various levels.
The technical criteria are highly detailed, with extensive references 
to European standards and regulations, which are not widely used 
outside the region. Applying them poses several challenges including: 
￮ where it is difficult to translate EU standards or regulations to a non-
EU context; 
￮ where Shell is materially aligned with a complex technical standard 
but varies in certain details; 
￮ where the criteria are expressed in qualitative terms that are open 
to interpretation; or 
￮ where the criteria are designed for a narrower range of applications 
than the one implied by the activity description.
These situations require us to apply judgement in determining whether 
the criteria are met.
Sometimes it is not possible to associate eligible turnover, capex or 
opex with a specific asset. For example, this can happen when we incur 
research and development expenses for an activity but the expenditure 
cannot be tied to a specific project for screening purposes. If alignment 
cannot be reasonably established according to our alignment 
screening process, the relevant amounts are classified as eligible 
but non-aligned.
Situations can arise where we may not be able to screen all assets in 
scope of an activity. This can occur when an activity contains a large 
number of early-stage projects and it is more efficient to focus on the 
most material projects and treat the remaining ones as eligible but
non-aligned. This situation can also arise when assets are acquired
late in the reporting cycle and there is insufficient time to conduct a 
high-quality screening, or when it has not been possible to obtain 
information about a non-operated asset from joint-venture partners. 
Such assets are treated as eligible but non-aligned by default. 
Assets that do not have eligible turnover, capex or opex to report 
are non-eligible and are not subject to technical screening. In practice, 
many early-stage projects are non-eligible because they have no 
turnover or capex to report, while feasibility expenditures incurred 
prior to a final investment decision (FID) are non-eligible under the 
opex performance indicator. Technical screening outcomes described 
in this disclosure apply only to eligible assets that have been screened 
in 2023.
Where some assets or products in scope of an economic activity are 
assessed as fully aligned with the technical screening criteria while 
others are not, an allocation method is applied so that only the aligned 
portion is included. For example, this can occur when some biofuels 
or biogas production is assessed as taxonomy-aligned and some 
is assessed as non-aligned. 
Where there is uncertainty with regard to how to interpret or apply any 
of the technical screening criteria in our alignment screening process, 
the relevant assets are assessed as non-aligned. In such cases, we 
intend to monitor future developments and update our approach 
as appropriate.
Substantial Contribution
The Substantial Contribution criteria are designed to ensure that an 
economic activity either has a substantial positive impact on one of the 
environmental objectives or substantially reduces negative impacts on 
the environment. The criteria vary from activity to activity.
Shell screened its eligible economic activities against all relevant 
environmental objectives. For five activities, assets in scope for 
screening were assessed as aligned with the Substantial Contribution 
criteria for climate mitigation, including solar, wind, hydrogen 
manufacturing, storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-
carbon road transport. For a sixth activity, manufacture of biogas and 
biofuels, some elements were assessed as aligned and some as non-
aligned, based on the proportion of feedstock meeting the Substantial 
Contribution criteria. 
Assets in scope for our remaining activities were assessed as non-
aligned. For two activities, alignment could not be established due to 
uncertainty about how to interpret and apply the technical screening 
criteria. This was the case for carbon transport and storage, where 
there are questions as to whether local standards are equivalent to 
the international and EU standards referenced by the criteria, and 
for conservation forestry, where the technical criteria differ from 
internationally recognised carbon credit standards.
Do No Significant Harm
The Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria are designed to ensure 
that an economic activity does not impede other environmental 
objectives being reached. The combination of the Substantial 
Contribution and Do No Significant Harm criteria is intended to ensure 
coherence between the taxonomy's objectives and to avoid progress 
towards one objective being made at the expense of another.
The DNSH criteria for activities contributing to climate change 
mitigation include detailed requirements for climate change 
adaptation, water, circular economy, pollution prevention and 
biodiversity. The criteria vary for each environmental objective 
and activity.

Shell screened its eligible economic activities against all relevant 
environmental objectives. For five activities, assets in scope for 
screening were assessed as aligned with the DNSH criteria for climate 
mitigation, including solar, wind, hydrogen manufacturing, storage of 
electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport. Some 
elements of our manufacture of biogas and biofuels activities were 
assessed as aligned and some as non-aligned.
In 2023 we carried out a review of physical climate risks for our eligible 
activities in line with the requirements of the Generic criteria for Do No 
Significant Harm to Climate Change Adaptation (Appendix A). The 
completion of this review made it possible to report several activities 
that were close to alignment in 2022 as aligned in 2023. For more 
information, see "Climate Related Physical Risk" on page 90.
In assessing alignment with the DNSH criteria, we were required to 
apply judgement to our electric vehicle charging activities. Electric 
vehicle charging is referenced by multiple economic activities in the 
taxonomy, each of which has a different set of technical screening 
criteria. There is a lack of consensus in the market about which one 
to apply. Shell categorised all its electric vehicle charging businesses 
under the activity with the most stringent criteria, "6.15 Infrastructure 
Enabling Low-Carbon Road Transport and Public Transport".
For this activity, we assessed the DNSH criteria for waste management 
to be more applicable to medium- or large-scale infrastructure projects 
than to distributed, small-scale electric vehicle charging infrastructure 
with a small construction footprint. Our operating standards for electric 
vehicle charging include measures to limit waste generation and 
encourage re-use and recycling, which we assess as materially 
equivalent.
Our remaining eligible activities were assessed as non-aligned with one 
or more of the DNSH criteria. In several cases, we assessed ourselves 
as non-aligned due to uncertainty about how to interpret various 
aspects of the technical screening criteria.
Minimum safeguards
The taxonomy defines the minimum safeguards as procedures 
implemented by a company to ensure alignment with the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, including the eight fundamental 
conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour 
Organisation on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the 
International Bill of Human Rights.
Respect for human rights is embedded in the Shell General 
Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. We have an integrated 
approach to human rights that is embedded into our policies and 
processes, which are applicable to all employees and contractors. 
This approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights.
We assessed our taxonomy-eligible activities as compliant with the 
minimum safeguards. For more information, see "Human Rights" 
on page 125.
Capex Plan assessment
As specified in the Disclosures Delegated Act, capex and opex can be 
treated as aligned when such expenditures form part of a Capex Plan 
aimed at expanding an aligned activity or upgrading an eligible 
activity to enable it to become aligned. 
To qualify, a Capex Plan must be approved by management and 
disclosed at the economic activity aggregated level. The expansion 
or upgrade must take place within five years unless a longer period 
is justified by the specific features of the activity and the upgrade 
concerned. This can be up to a maximum of 10 years. The justification for 
a longer transition period must feature in the Capex Plan and be included 
in the disclosure. If the Capex Plan fails to meet the conditions within 
the specified timeframe, previously published KPIs must be restated.
A lack of consensus exists in the market about how to interpret various 
aspects of the technical screening criteria. There is also uncertainty 
about how the criteria might apply to future performance conditions. 
Shell has therefore decided not to recognise any capex or opex as 
aligned under the Capex Plan provision in 2023.
Enabling and transitional activities 
The taxonomy designates a subset of aligned activities as "enabling" 
or "transitional". 
Transitional activities are those for which low-carbon alternatives are 
not yet available and which:
￮ have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best 
performance in the sector or industry;
￮ do not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon 
alternatives; and
￮ do not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the 
economic lifetime of those assets. 
Enabling activities are those which directly enable others to make a 
substantial contribution to an environmental objective, provided they:
￮ do not lead to a lock-in of assets that undermine long-term 
environmental goals, considering the economic lifetime of those 
assets; and
￮ have a substantial positive impact on the basis of life-cycle 
considerations. 
An economic activity is only transitional or enabling if it complies 
with the technical screening criteria. In 2023, two of Shell's activities, 
storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon road 
transport, qualified as enabling. 
Calculating the key performance indicators
The taxonomy KPIs consist of separate measures for eligible and 
aligned turnover, capex and opex. Each measure is calculated as 
the amount associated with eligible or aligned economic activities 
(numerator) divided by the total (denominator). In 2023, there was 
no change in the approach to calculate KPIs.
Turnover
The turnover KPI comprises the Revenue line from the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. This measure is reconciled as follows.
 EU Taxonomy turnover 2023
 
$ million
2023 2022
Revenue from contracts with customers  301,013  369,606 
Revenue from other sources  15,607  11,708 
Total EUT Turnover  316,620  381,314 
Shell's reporting of revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income 
follows the IFRS definition, under which realised and unrealised gains 
and losses from hedging are recognised in revenue. We follow the 
same principles when calculating the numerator and denominator for 
the turnover KPI. In 2023, excluding hedging effects would have an 
immaterial impact on the numerator and denominator.

Capex
The capex KPI comprises the Additions line from the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" Note 10 – Goodwill and other intangible assets; 
and the Additions line from the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
Note 11 – Property, plant and equipment. Goodwill is excluded from 
the measure.
When business combinations involving an eligible activity occur in a 
prior reporting period but Purchase Price Allocation takes place within 
the current period, we recognise the resulting movements to property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets as an addition. These 
amounts are contained within Note 10 – Goodwill and other intangible 
assets and Note 11 – Property, plant and equipment in the Sales, 
retirements and other movements line and are added to the numerator 
and denominator.
This measure is reconciled as follows.
 EU Taxonomy capex 2023

Additions to property, plant and equipment  25,831  28,254 
Additions to goodwill and other intangible 
assets  6,994  5,555 
Less: Goodwill  1,436  1,954 
Add: Other movements  83  445 
Total EUT Capex  31,472  32,300 
The numerator for aligned capex comprises the part of eligible capex 
that is (a) associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities; (b) 
part of a Capex Plan to expand an aligned activity or to enable a non-
aligned activity to become aligned; and (c) related to the purchase of 
output from taxonomy-eligible activities. Due to limited guidance about 
how (c) should be calculated, our reporting focuses on (a) and (b) only. 
The capex KPI as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation differs from 
Shell's cash capital expenditure measure. The latter monitors investing 
activities on a cash basis, excluding items such as lease additions, 
which do not necessarily result in cash outflows in the period. This 
measure comprises the following lines from the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows: Capital expenditure, investments in joint ventures and 
associates and investments in equity securities. The cash capex 
measure is presented on page 332.
Opex
The taxonomy defines the opex KPI as costs associated with 
maintenance and repair, research and development and short-term 
leases. This is narrower than Shell's definition of operating expenses 
and does not capture all of our expenditure on otherwise eligible 
activities. This measure is reconciled as follows:
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 329).

Total EUT Opex  5,333  4,934 
The numerator for aligned opex comprises the part of eligible opex that 
is (a) associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities; (b) part of 
a Capex Plan to expand an aligned activity or to enable a non-aligned 
activity to become aligned; and (c) related to the purchase of output 
from taxonomy-eligible activities. Due to limited guidance about how 
(c) should be calculated, our reporting focuses on (a) and (b) only.
Other accounting policies
Eligibility and alignment are calculated separately for each 
economic activity. 
The reporting boundary for each economic activity is determined by 
the description contained in the relevant delegated act. This boundary 
frequently differs from our integrated value chains and segmental 
reporting. As a result, various adjustments are needed to calculate the 
required figures. For example, we exclude sales of third-party products 
as well as trading and retailing from the calculation of the KPIs. These 
are significant for Shell's integrated business model but are not eligible 
for the taxonomy. Although intra-group sales are non-eligible, sales to 
our trading business are used in certain circumstances to calculate the 
turnover attributable to eligible parts of the value chain. 
When a reporting entity is engaged in multiple economic activities, 
an allocation method is applied so that only the appropriate part is 
included. Reconciliation is made to total turnover, capex and opex 
to avoid double counting.
In some cases, a subsidiary or other related undertaking may have 
interests in more than one economic activity but there insufficient data 
are available to disaggregate turnover, capex and opex. In these 
cases, we allocate the KPIs to the activity that best describes the 
primary business of the entity. 
Shell's eligible and aligned turnover, capex and opex are presented on 
pages 317-319 in accordance with templates specified in Annex II of 
the Disclosures Delegated Act as amended. Disclosures concerning our 
gas-related activities are presented on pages 320-323 in accordance 
with the requirements of the Disclosures Delegated Act, Articles 8(6) 
and (7), including the templates specified in Annex XII.

Contextual information on the KPIs
This section provides additional contextual information to accompany 
the presentation of the turnover, capex and opex KPIs on pages 
317-319.
Turnover
In 2023, Shell's taxonomy-eligible turnover was $8,445 million or 2.7% 
of the total, which was a decrease in absolute terms of $3,541 million 
compared with 2022. The economic activities that made the biggest 
contribution to eligible turnover were chemicals and plastics, 
renewable power (including wind, solar and installation of renewable 
energy technologies) and manufacture of biogas and biofuels.
Eligible turnover for renewable power increased to $842 million 
in 2023 from $462 million in 2022. Additional eligible revenue of 
$246 million was generated by manufacture of biogas and biofuels. 
The main drivers for increases were acquisitions and organic growth 
of the above businesses, offset by lower prices and lower demand 
for Chemicals products.
Aligned turnover of $542 million was generated by renewable power, 
low-carbon road transport and manufacture of biogas and biofuels.
Capex
In 2023, Shell's taxonomy-eligible capex was $6,032 million or 
19.2% of the total, which was comparable to capex reported in 2022. 
The economic activities that made the biggest contribution to eligible 
capex included manufacture of biogas and biofuels, low-carbon road 
transport, chemicals and renewable power (solar and wind).
Eligible capex for biogas and biofuels was $2,078 million in 2023 
compared with $580 million in 2022 driven by the business acquisition 
and the construction of the biofuels facility in Rotterdam. Solar and 
wind was a combined $1,596 million in 2023 compared with $2,862 
million in 2022 due to capital relocation in the renewable power 
business compared with material acquisitions in 2022. Eligible capex 
for low-carbon transport, which includes electric vehicle charging and 
hydrogen mobility, was $ 991 million in 2023 compared with $346 
million in 2022, driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Eligible 
capex for hydrogen was $199 million in 2023 compared to $139 
million in 2022. Eligible capex for plastics fell to $131 million in 2023 
from $1,914 million in 2022, reflecting the completion of construction 
activity at our Shell Polymers Monaca polyethylene production facility 
in Pennsylvania. A new activity, Storage of electricity, was added in 
2023 due to the development of new power storage projects, which 
added additional capex of $82 million. 
Aligned capex of $4,173 million was mainly driven by acquisition of 
the biogas business and growth of the biofuels business, by low-carbon 
road transport via its further growth and acquisitions, and by further 
developments in renewable power and manufacture of hydrogen. 
Capex additions related to acquisitions through business combinations 
are aggregated with other capex additions.
Opex
In 2023, Shell's taxonomy-eligible opex was $1,382 million or 25.9% 
of the total, which was higher by $586 million compared with 2022. 
The economic activities that made the biggest contribution to eligible 
opex include chemicals and plastics, biofuels and hydrogen. Our 
chemicals business is relatively mature compared with our other eligible 
activities and therefore accounts for the largest share of opex.
Eligible opex for chemicals increased to $776 million in 2023 from 
$658 million in 2022. Opex for plastics increased to $357 million due 
to commencement of operations at the Shell Polymers Monaca 
polyethylene production facility in Pennsylvania. An increase in 
opex in biofuels and hydrogen was mainly related to research 
and development expenditure.
Aligned opex of $30 million was incurred by wind power generation 
and low-carbon road transport and related to research and 
development work.

Shell plc (the Company) was incorporated in England and Wales on 
February 5, 2002, as a private company under the Companies Act 
1985, as amended. On October 27, 2004, the Company was re-
registered as a public company limited by shares and changed its 
name from Forthdeal Limited to Royal Dutch Shell plc. On January 21, 
2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to 
Shell plc. The Company is registered at Companies House, Cardiff, 
under company number 4366849. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
issued by the London Stock Exchange is 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70. 
The business address for the Directors and Senior Management is 
Shell Centre, London, SE1 7NA.
On December 31, 2021, the Company became tax resident in the 
United Kingdom. Its primary objective is to carry on the business of a 
holding company. It is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by 
another corporation or by any government and does not know of any 
arrangements that may result in a change of control of the Company.
Nature of trading market
On January 29, 2022, the Company established one single line of 
ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of €0.07. All shares are 
listed and able to trade at Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock 
Exchange. Furthermore, all shares are transferable between these two 
markets. This makes both these exchanges primary exchanges for the 
ordinary shares. 
Ordinary shares are traded in registered form. 
The Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange [A]. A depositary receipt is a certificate 
that evidences ADSs. Depositary receipts are issued, cancelled and 
exchanged at the office of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 383 Madison 
Avenue, New York, New York 10179, USA, as depositary (the 
Depositary), under Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement 
and Amendment No. 1 thereto (Deposit Agreement) between the 
Company, the Depositary and the holders of ADSs. Each ADS is 
equivalent to two ordinary shares of Shell plc deposited under the 
Deposit Agreement. All ordinary shares are capable of being 
deposited with the Depository in exchange for the corresponding 
amount of ADSs which may be traded at the New York Stock 
Exchange. This makes the New York Stock Exchange the primary 
exchange for the Company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). 
More information relating to ADSs is given on page 325.
[A] At February 19, 2024, 552,715,284 ADSs were outstanding, representing 17.07% of the 
ordinary share capital, held by holders of record with an address in the USA. In addition 
to holders of ADSs, at February 19, 2024, 888,197 ordinary shares of €0.07 each were

Designation of the Netherlands as EU Home Member 
State for regulatory purposes
Following the exit of the UK from the EU and the end of the transition 
period, the Company announced that the EU Home Member State of 
the Company for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive would 
be the Netherlands as from January 1, 2021. As a consequence, the 
Company files Transparency Directive and Market Abuse Regulation-
related regulatory information with the Netherlands Authority for the 
Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, or AFM). Major 
shareholders are required to report substantial holdings in Shell to the 
AFM in accordance with applicable Dutch law, in addition to their 
ongoing disclosure obligations under the UK Disclosure Guidance 
and Transparency Rules (DTR).
Method of holding shares or an interest in shares
There are several ways in which Shell plc registered shares or an 
interest in these shares can be held, including:
￮ directly as registered shares either in uncertificated form or in 
certificated form in a shareholder's own name;
￮ indirectly through Euroclear Nederland (in respect of which the 
Dutch Securities Giro Act (Wet giraal effectenverkeer) is applicable);
￮ through the Shell Corporate Nominee Service;
￮ through another third-party nominee or intermediary company; and 
￮ as a direct or indirect holder of either ADS with the Depositary.
American Depositary Shares
The Depositary is the registered shareholder of the shares underlying 
the ADSs and enjoys the rights of a shareholder under the Articles. 
Holders of ADSs will not have shareholder rights. The rights of the 
holder of an ADS are specified in the Deposit Agreement with the 
Depositary and are summarised below.
The Depositary will receive all cash dividends and other cash 
distributions made on the deposited shares underlying the ADSs 
and, where possible and on a reasonable basis, will distribute such 
dividends and distributions to holders of ADSs. Rights to purchase 
additional shares will also be made available to the Depositary 
who may make such rights available to holders of ADSs. All other 
distributions made on the Company's shares will be distributed by the 
Depositary in any means that the Depositary thinks is equitable and 
practical. The Depositary may deduct its fees and expenses and the 
amount of any taxes owed from any payments to holders and it may 
sell a holder's deposited shares to pay any taxes owed. The Depositary 
is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make 
a distribution available to holders of ADSs.
The Depositary will notify holders of ADSs of shareholders' meetings
of the Company and will arrange to deliver voting materials to such 
holders of ADSs if requested by the Company. Upon request by a 
holder, the Depositary will endeavour to appoint such holder as proxy 
in respect of such holder's deposited shares entitling such holder 
to attend and vote at shareholders' meetings. Holders of ADSs may 
also instruct the Depositary to vote their deposited securities and the 
Depositary will try, as far as practical and lawful, to vote deposited 
shares in accordance with such instructions. The Company cannot 
ensure that holders will receive voting materials or otherwise learn 
of an upcoming shareholders' meeting in time to ensure that holders 
can instruct the Depositary to vote their shares.
Upon payment of appropriate fees, expenses and taxes: 
(i) shareholders may deposit their shares with the Depositary and 
receive the corresponding class and amount of ADSs; and (ii) holders 
of ADSs may surrender their ADSs to the Depositary and have the 
corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account.
Further, subject to certain limitations, holders may, at any time, cancel 
ADSs and withdraw their underlying shares or have the corresponding 
class and amount of shares credited to their account.
Fees paid by holders of ADSs
The Depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs 
directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for 
the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. 
The Depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors 
by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling 
a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The Depositary 
may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees 
for those services are paid. See page 326.
Payments by Depositary to the Company 
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Depositary, has agreed to share 
with the Company portions of certain fees collected, less ADS 
programme expenses paid by the Depositary. For example, these 
expenses include the Depositary's annual programme fees, transfer 
agency fees, custody fees, legal expenses, postage and envelopes for 
mailing annual and interim financial reports, printing and distributing 
dividend cheques, electronic filing of US federal tax information, 
mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimile and 
telephone calls and the standard out-of-pocket maintenance 
costs for the ADSs. From January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, 
the Company received $1,405,209.34 from the Depositary.

Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) which enables Shell plc shareholders to elect 
to have their dividend payments used to purchase Shell plc ordinary 
shares. More information can be found at shareview.co.uk/info/drip 
or by contacting Equiniti.
ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. also operate

Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders
Other than restrictions affecting those individuals, entities, government 
bodies, corporations, or activities that are targeted by European Union 
(EU) or UK sanctions for example, regarding Syria, Russia or North 
Korea, and the general EU prohibition to transfer funds to and from 
for example, North Korea or Syria and the more recent EU financial 
restrictions affecting Russia, we are not aware of any other legislative 
or other legal provision currently in force in the UK, the Netherlands, 
the EU or arising under the Articles restricting remittances to holders 
of the Company's ordinary shares who are non-residents of the UK, 
or affecting the import or export of capital.
Taxation
General
The Company is incorporated in England and Wales. The Company 
changed tax residence from the Netherlands to the UK on December 
31, 2021.
As a tax resident of the Netherlands, it is generally required by Dutch 
law to withhold tax at a rate of 15% on dividends on its ordinary shares 
and ADSs, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax convention 
or domestic law. Depending on their particular circumstances, non-
Dutch tax-resident holders may be entitled to a full or partial refund of 
Dutch withholding tax. The following sets forth the operation of other 
provisions on dividends on the Company's various ordinary shares and 
ADSs to UK and US holders, as well as certain other tax rules pertinent 
to holders during or prior to the 2021 financial year. Holders should 
consult their own tax adviser if they are uncertain as to the tax 
treatment of any dividend.
Dividends paid on the dividend access shares
As part of the Simplification, the A ordinary shares and B ordinary 
shares were assimilated into one single line of ordinary shares. Prior 
to the assimilation, there was no Dutch withholding tax on dividends 
on B shares or B ADSs, provided that such dividends are paid on the 
dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism (see 
dividend access mechanism for B shares on page 208). Dividends paid 
on the dividend access shares are treated as UK-source for tax 
purposes and there is no UK withholding tax on them.
In 2021, all dividends with respect to B shares and B ADSs were 
paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend 
access mechanism.

Dutch withholding tax 
On January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through 
assimilation of each A share and each B share into one single line of 
ordinary shares of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on 
voting rights or dividend entitlements. Dutch dividend withholding tax, 
applied previously on dividends on A shares, no longer applies on 
dividends paid on the now assimilated ordinary shares following 
the move of the Company's tax residence to the UK. 
The following applies to dividends paid in 2021 and prior financial 
years and is included in the report for reference:
When Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to a US holder 
(that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B shares or B ADSs 
that are not paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the 
dividend access mechanism), the US holder will be subject to Dutch 
withholding tax at the rate of 15%. A US holder who is entitled to the 
benefits of the 1992 Double Taxation Convention (the Convention) 
between the USA and the Netherlands as amended by the protocol 
signed on March 8, 2004, will be entitled to a reduction in the Dutch 
withholding tax, either by way of a full or a partial exemption at source 
or by way of a partial refund or a credit as follows:
￮ if the US holder is an exempt pension trust as described in article 35 
of the Convention, or an exempt organisation as described in article 
36 thereof, the US holder will be exempt from Dutch withholding tax; 
or
￮ if the US holder is a company that holds directly at least 10% of the 
voting power in the Company, the US holder will be subject to Dutch 
withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 5%.
In general, the entire dividend (including any amount withheld) will 
be dividend income to the US holder and the withholding tax will 
be treated as a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against 
the US holder's income tax liability or a deduction subject to certain 
limitations. A "US holder" includes, but is not limited to, a citizen or 
resident of the USA, or a corporation or other entity organised under 
the laws of the USA or any of its political subdivisions.
When Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to UK tax-
resident holders (that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B 
shares or B ADSs that are not paid on the dividend access shares 
pursuant to the dividend access mechanism), the dividend will typically 
be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15%. Such UK tax-resident 
holder may be entitled to a credit (not repayable) for withholding tax 
against their UK tax liability. However, certain corporate shareholders 
are, subject to conditions, exempt from UK tax on dividends. 
Withholding tax suffered cannot be offset against such exempt 
dividends. UK tax-resident holders should also be entitled to claim a 
refund of one-third of the Dutch withholding tax from the Dutch tax 
authorities in reliance on the tax convention between the Netherlands 
and the UK. Pension plans meeting certain defined criteria can, 
however, be entitled to claim a full refund or exemption at source of 
the dividend tax withheld. Also, UK tax-resident corporate shareholders 
holding at least a 5% shareholding and meeting other defined criteria 
are exempted at source from dividend tax.
For holders who are tax-resident in any other country, the availability 
of a whole or partial exemption or refund of Dutch withholding tax is 
governed by Dutch tax law and/or the tax convention, if any, between 
the Netherlands and the country of the holder's residence.
There may be other grounds on which holders who are tax-resident in 
the UK, the USA or any other country can obtain a full or partial refund 
of the Dutch withholding tax, depending on their particular 
circumstances; see "Taxation: General" above.
Dutch capital gains taxation
Capital gains on the sale of shares of a Dutch tax-resident company by 
a US holder are generally not subject to taxation by the Netherlands 
unless the US holder has a permanent establishment therein and the 
capital gain is derived from the sale of shares that are part of the 
business property of the permanent establishment.
Dutch succession duty and gift taxes
Shares of a Dutch tax-resident company held by an individual 
who is not a resident or a deemed resident of the Netherlands 
will generally not be subject to succession duty in the Netherlands
on the individual's death.
A gift of shares of a Dutch tax-resident company by an individual who 
is not a resident or a deemed resident of the Netherlands is generally 
not subject to Dutch gift tax.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Sales or transfers of the Company's ordinary shares within a clearance 
service (such as Euroclear Nederland) or of the Company's ADSs within 
the ADS depositary receipts system will not give rise to a stamp duty 
reserve tax (SDRT) liability and should not in practice require the 
payment of UK stamp duty.
The transfer of the Company's ordinary shares to a clearance service 
(such as Euroclear Nederland) or to an issuer of depositary shares 
(such as ADSs) will generally give rise to a UK stamp duty or SDRT 
liability at the rate of 1.5% of consideration given or, if none, of the 
value of the shares. A sale of the Company's ordinary shares that are 
not held within a clearance service (for example, settled through the 
UK's CREST system of paperless transfers) will generally be subject 
to UK stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount of the 
consideration, normally paid by the purchaser.

The activities listed below have been conducted outside the USA by 
non-US affiliates of Shell plc. None of the payments disclosed below 
were made in US dollars, nor are any of the balances disclosed below 
held in US dollars; however, for disclosure purposes, all have been

In February 2022, Shell Development Iran BV signed an extension to 
the contract for provision of accounting services with Bayat Rayan 
Chartered Accountants, an Iranian accounting firm, extending their 
services to 2024. A payment was made in 2023 for the amount of 
$801,986.34 for services covering the period 2022 to 2024. There 
was no gross revenue or net profit associated with this transaction. 
Payment for services may continue in the future.
We maintain accounts with Karafarin Bank where our cash deposits 
(balance of $5,254,128.26 at December 31, 2023) generated non-
taxable interest income of $261,273.60 in 2023 and we paid $9.55 in 
bank charges and $0.24 in tax stamp. As the accounts with Karafarin 
Bank will be maintained for the foreseeable future, we expect that the 
receipt of non-taxable interest income and the payment of bank 
charges and tax stamp to continue in the future.

These non-GAAP measures, also known as alternative performance measures, are financial measures other than those defined in International 
Financial Reporting Standards, which Shell considers provide useful information. 
Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis
Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive 
Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes 
sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings 
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. The current cost of supplies adjustment does not impact 
cash flow from operating activities in the "Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows". For "Reconciliation of CCS earnings to income for the period", 
please refer to Note 7 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".
Adjusted Earnings per share
Adjusted Earnings per share were calculated as Adjusted Earnings (see below), divided by the weighted average number of shares used as the 
basis for basic earnings per share (see Note 30 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). Adjusted Earnings per share were $4.20 in 2023 
(2023 Adjusted Earnings: $28,250 million; 2023 weighted average number of shares 6,733.5 million) and $5.43 in 2022 (2022 Adjusted 
Earnings $39,870 million; 2022 weighted average number of shares: 7,347.5 million).
Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), and Cash flow 
from operating activities
The "Adjusted Earnings" measure is presented on a CCS basis and aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance 
from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items 
adjusted for current cost of supplies. These items are in some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder 
the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period.
The "Adjusted EBITDA" measure is presented on a CCS basis and used by management to evaluate Shell's performance in the period and over 
time. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as "Income/(loss) for the period" adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/(credit); 
depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense. All items include the non-controlling interest 
component.

on net income/loss arising from transactions which are generally 
uncontrollable and unusual (infrequent or non-recurring) in nature 
or giving rise to a mismatch of accounting and economic results, 
or certain transactions that are generally excluded from underlying 
results in the industry.
Identified items comprise: divestment gains and losses, impairments, 
redundancy and restructuring, provisions for onerous contracts, fair 
value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts 
and the impact of exchange rate movements on certain deferred tax 
balances, and other items. Identified items in the table below are

reported within "Share of profit of joint ventures and associates" in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income, and fully reported as identified 
items included in Income/(loss) before taxation in the table above. 
Identified items related to subsidiaries are consolidated and reported 
across appropriate lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Only pre-tax identified items reported by subsidiaries are taken into 
account in the calculation of underlying operating expenses.
Provisions for onerous contracts: Provisions for onerous contracts 
that relate to businesses that Shell has exited or to redundant assets 
or assets that cannot be used.
Fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas 
contracts: In the ordinary course of business, Shell enters into contracts 
to supply or purchase oil and gas products, as well as power and 
environmental products. Shell also enters into contracts for tolling, 
pipeline and storage capacity. Derivative contracts are entered into for 
mitigation of resulting economic exposures (generally price exposure) 
and these derivative contracts are carried at period-end market price 
(fair value), with movements in fair value recognised in income for the 
period. Supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational 
purposes, as well as contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage 
capacity, are, by contrast, recognised when the transaction occurs; 
furthermore, inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable 
value, whichever is lower. As a consequence, accounting mismatches 
occur because: (a) the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in 
a different period, or (b) the inventory is measured on a different basis. 
In addition, certain contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, 
deemed to contain embedded derivatives or written options and are 
also required to be carried at fair value even though they are entered 
into for operational purposes. The accounting impacts are reported 
as identified items.
Impacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the 
impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising on (a) the 
conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non-monetary 
assets and liabilities, as well as losses (this primarily impacts the 
Upstream and Integrated Gas segments) and (b) the conversion of 
dollar-denominated inter-segment loans to local currency, leading to 
taxable exchange rate gains or losses (this primarily impacts the 
Corporate segment).
Other identified items represent other credits or charges that based on 
Shell management's assessment hinder the comparative understanding 
of Shell's financial results from period to period.

Cash capital expenditure 
Cash capital expenditure monitors investing activities on a cash basis, 
excluding items such as lease additions which do not necessarily result 
in cash outflows in the period. The measure comprises the following 
lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Capital 
expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and 
Investments in equity securities. The reconciliation of "Capital 
expenditure" to "Cash capital expenditure" is presented in Note 7 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".
Operating expenses and underlying operating expenses
Operating expenses is a measure of Shell's cost management 
performance, comprising the following items from the "Consolidated 
Statement of Income": production and manufacturing expenses; selling, 
distribution and administrative expenses; and research and 
development expenses. See Note 7 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" for reconciliation of total operating expenses. 
Underlying operating expenses is a measure aimed at facilitating 
a comparative understanding of performance from period to period 
by removing the effects of identified items, which, either individually 
or collectively, can cause volatility, in some cases driven by 
external factors.

Total spend on goods and services
Total spend on goods and services represents the amounts paid to our 
suppliers globally and is comprised of both Capital Expenditure and 
Operating Expenditure. Employee costs are excluded from Operating 
costs as these do not relate to 3rd party/supplier spend. 
The total spend on goods and services is used to demonstrate the 
company's societal contribution towards suppliers, contractors and 
communities where Shell operates and is disclosed annually in the 
Sustainability Report.
The calculation of Total spend on goods and services has changed, 
with data published in previous years being limited to spend for 
Operated assets that has been contracted with the support of the 
Contracting and Procurement team, calculated on a cash 
payments basis.

Structural cost reduction
The structural cost reduction target was introduced during Capital 
Markets Day in 2023 for the purpose of demonstrating how 
management drives cost discipline across the entire organisation, 
simplifying our processes, portfolio and streamlining the way we work.
Structural cost reduction describes decrease in underlying operating 
expenses as a result of operational efficiencies, divestments, workforce 
reductions and other cost-saving measures that are expected to be 
sustainable compared with 2022 levels. 
The total change between periods in underlying operating expenses 
will reflect both structural cost reductions and other changes in spend, 
including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange 
impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated 
with new operations. 
Estimates of cumulative annual structural cost reduction may be revised 
depending on whether cost reductions realised in prior periods are 
determined to be sustainable compared to 2022 levels. Structural cost 
reductions are stewarded internally to support management's oversight 
of spending over time. 2025 target reflects annualised saving achieved 
by end-2025.

Return on average capital employed
Return on average capital employed ("ROACE") measures the 
efficiency of Shell's utilisation of the capital that it employs. Shell uses 
two ROACE measures: ROACE on a Net income basis and ROACE on 
an Adjusted Earnings plus Non-controlling interest basis, both adjusted 
for after-tax interest expense. 
Both measures refer to Capital employed which consists of total equity, 
current debt and non-current debt.

Net debt and gearing
Net debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less 
cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest 
rate risk relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. 
Management considers this adjustment useful because it reduces the 
volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and 
interest rates, and eliminates the potential impact of related collateral 
payments or receipts. Debt-related derivative financial instruments are 
a subset of the derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities 
presented on the balance sheet. Collateral balances are reported 
under "Trade and other receivables" or "Trade and other payables" 
as appropriate. See also Note 20 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements". 
Gearing is a measure of Shell's capital structure and is defined as 
net debt (total debt less cash and cash equivalents) as a percentage 
of total capital (net debt plus total equity).
