I am pleased to present the 
AEoN Credit Service (M) Berhad 
(“AEoN Credit” or “the Group”) 
Integrated Annual r eport 
for the financial year ended  
28 February 2023 (“FYE2023”). 
During a year of domestic 
recovery amidst global 
headwinds, AEoN Credit 
has resolutely continued 
its strategy to advance 
digitalisation capabilities, 
drive business expansion, 
and fortify our customer-first 
ethos. Despite the challenging

SEGMENTS DESPITE ThE 
ChALLENGING LANDSCAPE.
DELIVEr ING DISTINCT VALUE
In 2022, despite global inflationary disquiet exacerbated by geopolitical 
concerns from the Ukraine war to China’s stance on zero COVID 
policy, the Malaysian economy grew beyond expectations,  
recording a gross domestic product (“GDP”) of 8.7%, anchored on 
support from stimulus measures, robust private sector activities and 
improving labour market conditions. 
As economic activities normalised to pre-pandemic levels, coupled 
with the Group’s mid-term strategy to drive receivables growth,  
we have witnessed an improved performance across all key 
product segments despite the challenging landscape. The Group 
recorded a profit after tax (“PAT”) of RM417.69 million compared to  
RM365.42 million in the previous financial year. This was driven 
predominantly by increased interest income and fee income,  
supported by improved transaction and financing volume, coupled 
with a significant reduction in operating expenses.
Further details of the Group’s financial performance are set out in the 
Management Discussion and Analysis section of this IAR. 
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended the payment of a final single-tier dividend 
of 21.0 sen per ordinary share to be paid on 20 July 2023 subject to the 
approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”). This brings total dividend payout for FYE2023 to 49.5 sen, 
translating to a payout ratio of 30.3%.
oUr STrATEGIC ProGr ESS
Within the rapidly changing post pandemic market environment, 
elevating our implementation on the digital front was the key priority 
for FYE2023 in building momentum and growing our market share.  
Focus was also directed towards creating distinct value for our 
stakeholders, meeting elevated customer expectations, and growing 
our business capabilities.
i.  Digital onboarding process
  During the year, we launched the Easy Payment digital onboarding 
process for instant conditional approval to customers. Backed 
by e-KYC solutions and scoring models, customers can 
complete their entire application journey and receive instant 
conditional approval in just 15 minutes. To-date, we have  
reached out to over 1,100 merchants to promote this initiative.  
We aim to continue scaling up our digital acquisition share and 
elevate customer experience. This onboarding process leverages 
on Fintech solutions and will soon be implemented into the  
Group’s personal financing and credit card businesses.

ii.  r evamped AEoN Wallet app 
  We expanded the use of digital channels to deliver 
quick service to our customers. During the year,  
we revamped our AEON Wallet app with features for 
better user experience (“UX”). Customers can now 
apply for our credit cards and personal financing via 
their AEON Wallet anytime anywhere. Other features 
introduced to enhance customer convenience  
include Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) transfer, financing 
details and repayment as well as E-Donation 
function. Consequently, we have acquired a 
commendable 25% year-on-year growth in our 
AEON Wallet registrations with a sizeable user base  
of 1.63 million users.
iii. Net Promoter Score
  We introduced the first-ever Net Promoter Score 
(“NPS”) in August 2022, which is a measure of our 
customers’ willingness to recommend our products 
and services to others. This helps AEON Credit to 
drive a customer-first philosophy by consistently 
monitoring and tracking customer experience and 
satisfaction levels through various platforms – all 
of which have recorded rating improvements in the 
FYE2023 evaluation. 
iv.   Establishment of Islamic Commercial Papers (ICP) 
programme
  AEON Credit established its Islamic Commercial 
Paper (“ICP”) Programme of up to RM1 billion in 
nominal value in November 2022 to replace the 
ICP that expired in August 2022 and subsequently 
issued the first ICP in March 2023. The ICP 
Programme has been assigned a credit rating of P1 
by RAM Rating Services Berhad. The proceeds will 
be used, among others, to finance disbursements to  
customers, financing of expenses relating to the ICP 
Programme and refinance any existing and future 
Islamic financing facilities.
hUMAN CAPITAL
Talent is at the forefront of our human capital management 
approach as our people make the distinctive difference in 
our service and value delivery. In the year under review, 
we have established sustainable Human Resource 
(“HR”) practices which include establishing an employee 
reward roadmap, building a sustainable talent pipeline,  
and engaging with employees through learning 
programmes, career progression opportunities as well as 
leadership programmes. In addition, we have launched the 
FlexHR mobile app to provide an e-platform functionality 
to further improve engagements with our employees. 
We will continuously strive to upgrade HR processes to 
attract and retain the right talents, save costs and build  
our reputation as an Employer of Choice.

AChIEVING DISTINCTIoN ThroUGh ESG 
Acknowledging the importance of Environmental,  
Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations in 
driving business success, AEON Credit has established 
a Sustainability Framework and formulated our 3-year 
Sustainability Roadmap towards becoming a leading 
ESG Company in the financial services industry by 2025.  
This outlines goals and initiatives aligned to AEON Credit’s 
material matters and focus areas, and lay the groundwork 
for us to improve and increase our reporting of  
climate-related and other financial information.
In line with the framework and roadmap, the Board has 
formulated a statement “Shaping our future in financial 
services through sound, innovative and sustainable  
ESG practices and initiatives”  to reflect our continuous 
efforts in upholding our commitments towards ESG  
across the Group. 
Furthermore, we have secured three-year Sustainability-
Linked Loans (“SLL”) of total RM600 million – a first for a 
non-bank financial services provider. This is a significant 
initiative for the Group to actively support and promote 
sustainability practices by fostering and influencing a wider 
adoption of ESG through provision of green and social 
financing funded by the SLL. 
As part of the AEON Group of Companies in Malaysia,  
we also continue to collaborate with Malaysian AEON 
Foundation’s programmes that aim to provide 
opportunities, encouragement and support to communities 
in need, as well as spur creative production and retail 
growth through collaboration with local businesses, 
entrepreneurs and SMEs.
Most notably, AEON Credit attained industry recognition 
for our sustainability efforts in FYE2023, and was named 
silver winner for “The Most Consistent Performer Over 5 
Years” under the Equities category at The Edge Malaysia 
ESG Awards 2022 in recognition of our ESG achievement.
Further details of the Group’s sustainability performance 
are set out in the Sustainability Statement of this IAR.
ATTAINING DISTINCTIoN ThroUGh GooD 
GoVErNANCE & EFFECTIVE r ISK MANAGEMENT
In the post pandemic era, the rapid rate of digital 
transformation has brought about new challenges on 
the front of governance and risk. The current surge of 
scams and frauds, especially online frauds in Malaysia has 
made information technology security a key priority to  
ensure customer confidence in financial institutions.  
ChAIrMAN’S STATEMENT
Coupled with the economic challenges anticipated  
within the global and domestic outlook, businesses have 
to dynamically step up preparedness in tackling scams, 
frauds, corruption and other emerging risks.
Therefore, during the year under review, the Board 
has actively reviewed the Group’s existing policies and 
frameworks pertaining to these areas to ensure that 
we adhere to the latest requirements from regulators 
and authorities, especially in the management of  
anti-corruption practices and business continuity.
On the risk front, in addition to the annual cyber 
security drills to ensure readiness of business operation 
in the event of cyber-attacks, we have established a

framework based on Bank Negara Malaysia’s policy 
document on Risk Management in Technology (“RMiT”). 
Further, AEON Credit has also joined the Association of 
E-money Issuers in Malaysia and actively collaborates  
with the association and other members in combatting 
frauds and scams.
A feather in our cap during the year under review 
was the conferment of ASEAN Asset Class at the  
2021 ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (“ACGS”) 
Awards ceremony for our efforts in practicing good 
corporate governance across the Group’s activities.
hErALDING A NEW ErA 
For 2023, the Malaysian economy is projected to grow 
moderately backed by private consumption, recovery of 
the labour market and improved tourism activity. Inflation 
has stabilised but expectations will remain elevated  
throughout  the year. The balance of risks remains tilted  
to the downside, mainly from weaker global economic 
growth, tighter financial conditions, re-escalation of 
geopolitical tensions and continuing supply chain 
disruptions.

REFLECTIONS FROM 
TOP LEADERSHIP
Given the competitive market conditions and our 
motivated mid-term strategy, we have earmarked 
four main pillars for our sustainable growth namely,  
receivables growth, enriching customers’ experience, 
developing employees and sustainability governance. 
We target to complete the end-to-end digital transformation 
and the introduction of new AEON mobile app by 
this year. By rolling out the new AEON mobile app,  
we will be able to integrate our databases and embed 
all links and functions to build an ecosystem that offers 
our customers seamless access to every product and 
service. This will be realised through an envisioned  
AEON Living Zone that offers one-stop access to all the 
Group’s product and service offerings, from AEON Group 
membership benefits and financing, to digital banking 
and insurance. By 2025, we aim to be Malaysia’s leading 
innovative retail Fintech Company with a significant 
E-Wallet user base. 
Further, the Group will closely monitor and assess the 
potential risks in our financing portfolios to ensure healthy 
asset quality. This approach is the key to strengthening 
our fundamentals to sustain, adapt and future-proof our 
business for the changing times ahead.
Moving forward on the insurance broking business 
front, AEON Insurance Brokers is focusing on building a 
robust core system to support its operations and business 
expansion. This is targeted for completion by July 2023. 
When this system goes live, we anticipate a higher 
penetration and growth rate from the Insurtech segment. 
Last but not least, I am happy to report that our digital 
bank journey together with our holding company AEON 
Financial Service Co., Ltd. has been kickstarted. In keeping 
with the timeline to have our digital bank operating within  
24 months, we had appointed technology partners  
for systems development and is now focused on an 
operational readiness plan wherein the digital bank targets 
to commence operations in the first quarter of 2024. 
On the journey ahead, the Board remains committed 
to ensuring AEON Credit continues to comply with all 
applicable laws and regulations, including those related 
to the current emphasis on environmental, social and 
governance responsibility. 
IN APPr ECIATIoN 
I take this opportunity to express my utmost to the members 
of the Board for their invaluable guidance and counsel. 
Their diversity in backgrounds and experiences have 
provided vital support to our management team on key 
issues such as strategic direction, financial management, 
risk management and corporate governance.
On behalf of the Board and the Group, I would like to offer 
my best wishes to Datin Khoo Pek Ling who will be retiring 
at the 26th AGM. Her invaluable contributions will always 
be cherished and she will be dearly missed. 
The Group’s laudable accomplishment was a result of the 
efforts of many parties, and I sincerely appreciate their 
contributions. I want to extend the Board’s profound 
gratitude to our shareholders, bankers and regulators for 
their continuing faith and unwavering support of us.
Salutations to all of our employees who have worked  
hard, passionately, and professionally, in ensuring that 
we stayed ahead of the curve and to achieve our vision.  
Our future is in our people. We are well-positioned to 
advance our plans and provide value to our stakeholders 
under the direction of a strong leadership team in keeping 
with our AEON culture.
Finally to our customers and business partners, a big thank 
you for your steadfast support and loyalty all these times. 
We could not have achieved the year’s milestones without 
your support and trust in our commitment to excellence. 
We look forward to your continued confidence in us.
Thank you.

oVErVIEW oF FYE2023 PEr ForMANCE
Global economy experienced volatility in 2022 due to intensified trade 
conflict between US and China, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the 
implementation of Zero COVID Policy by China. The above events 
gave rise to supply chain disruptions that reverberated across the 
globe causing economies to grapple with supply/demand imbalances, 
escalating inflation and rising interest rates.
In Malaysia, Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) for 2022 recorded 
encouraging performance of 8.7% growth contributed by robust 
domestic and external demand besides the improved labour market.  
As a result of the recent pandemic, digitalisation and sustainability are 
now key drivers for growth.
Responding proactively to changing expectations, AEON Credit focused 
on accelerating our digital onboarding capabilities in FYE2023. 
In response to the growing global requirement for climate action 
through the adoption of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
measures, AEON Credit adopted sustainability practices which aligned  
with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”)  
into our business strategy and operations. 
AEON Credit remains steadfast and is fully committed to bringing 
the best products and services to fit market demand and to be the 
most preferred non-bank financial services provider to customers,  
with a thriving future as a leading innovative retail Fintech Company 
and ESG champion in the non-bank financial sector in Malaysia.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSIoN AND ANALYSIS  
DELIVErING DISTINCT VALUE
The financial position of the Group remains strong and 
healthy with total assets increasing 9.6% from February 
2022 to RM11.12 billion as at 28 February 2023. Net assets 
per share improved to RM9.10 (2022: RM7.84), with total 
equity at RM2.52 billion as at end-February 2023. 
The Group’s gross financing receivables expanded by  
9.9% to RM10.84 billion compared to RM9.86 billion 
recorded in last financial year, contributed primarily by 
effective marketing campaigns to drive transaction and 
financing volume growth. Net credit cost on average 
financing receivables was recorded at 2.57% (FYE2022: 
1.47%) due to higher allowance for impairment losses,  
while Non-Performing Loans (“NPL”) ratio slightly 
deteriorated to 2.89% as at end February 2023 from  
2.66% a year ago due to lower collection performance  
caused by weaker debt servicing capacity of certain 
customers segments. To withstand this, the Group has 
implemented necessary measures including stringent 
credit assessment criteria for certain customer segments, 
periodic review of credit policies and enhanced recovery 
efforts. Loan loss coverage ratio stood at 252% for  
FYE2023 as compared to 289% for FYE2022. 
Meanwhile, the Group recorded a Return on Equity  
(“ROE”) and Return on Asset (“ROA”) of 18.8% and 3.9% 
respectively. Capital adequacy ratio (“CAR”) stood at  
27.1%, the strong capital position providing ample 
headroom for future growth.
FINANCIAL PErForMANCE rEVIEW
In tandem with the economic recovery, the Group  
recorded a stronger financial performance for FYE2023, 
with total transaction and financing volume registering  
an increase of 31.0% to RM6.25 billion as compared to 
RM4.77 billion recorded in the previous financial year 
ended 28 February 2022 (“FYE2022”). 
Correspondingly, the Group’s revenue increased by 
7.6% year-on-year (“YoY”) to RM1.64 billion from RM1.52 
billion a year ago, contributed by higher interest and fee  
income. Other income increased by 8.8% to RM197.30 
million for FYE2023 (FYE2022: RM181.36 million) on the 
back of improved bad debt recoveries. 
Total operating expenses increased by 14.9% to  
RM974.64 million (FYE2022: RM848.53 million), arising 
mainly from higher impairment loss (“IL”) on financing 
receivables by RM144.55 million to RM447.83 million 
(FYE2022: RM303.28 million). This was however 
offset by lower operating expenses of by 3.4% YoY to  
RM526.81 million as compared to RM545.25 million a 
year ago, bringing our cost-to-income ratio excluding IL 
to 28.7% as compared to 32.0% in FYE2022. Nonetheless, 
the Group will continue to remain disciplined in cost 
management and pursue various strategic efforts to 
drive operational efficiency and cost optimisation while 
accelerating digitalisation for better customer experience. 
The Group’s profit before tax (“PBT”) rose to RM546.98 
million (FYE2022: RM526.82 million) while profit 
after tax (“PAT”) recorded a new high of RM417.69  
million in FYE2023, up 14.3% from RM365.42 million a

Easy Payment and Personal Financing (“EPPF”) business continue to be the 
major contributor to the revenue and profit growth for the Group. During the 
year under review, AEON Credit continued to focus on strategic product and 
marketing efforts coupled with better branch productivity and digitalisation 
initiatives, including ongoing promotions and marketing campaigns via 
web sales channel and other outreach platforms, while effective merchant 
development and innovative partnership programmes were implemented to

Total financing volume generated by EPPF business increased by 42.0% to  
RM4.44 billion in FYE2023 as compared to RM3.13 billion in FYE2022.  
All products registered growth during the year, with Motorcycles Financing

Payment Business
FYE2023 marked the kickstart of a new phase for the Group’s Payment  
Business segment with emphasis directed towards credit card acquisition, 
expanding payment functionality and improvement of the AEON Wallet user 
experience (“UX”).
In FYE2023, total credit card sales transaction and financing volume increased 
by 11.8% to RM1.63 billion while receivables declined marginally by 0.6% to  
RM717.91 million contributed by better collection performance. 
Acquiring transactions volume increased by 54.8% YoY to RM2.55 billion as 
compared to RM1.64 billion in FYE2022. About RM1.72 billion or an increase 
of 20% YoY of the acquiring transactions was derived from AEON Group of 
Companies through 3,479 terminals deployed at its retail payment counters in 
line with the increase in consumer spending and increase in shopping footfall.
E-money transactions declined marginally by 3.9% to RM179.24 million 
(FYE2022: RM186.45 million) due to lower average spending per card.  
AEON Member Plus (“AMP”) card base continued to grow to 2.40 million at  
a rate of 9% YoY while the revenue increased by 16.0% to RM15.96 million. 
Besides, the AEON Wallet was refreshed with enhanced UX which has  
brought a surge in usage. In the five months since the revamp, there have 
been 97,015 new sign ups, followed by a 70% increase in QR payment and  
33% increase in top-up amount. 
As part of our vision to provide financial services that contribute towards an 
equitable society, we have collaborated with AEON Group of Companies, 
Ministry of Entrepreneur Development and Cooperatives (“MEDAC”) and 
In2Niaga Sdn. Bhd (“IN2NIAGA”) to issue a privilege card for Hawkers and 
Petty Traders that provides underserved hawkers and traders a host of  
privileged benefits and rebates through the AEON loyalty programme. This also 
helps to drive member sales and payment volume during curated events for  
AMP members such as AEON Retail Anniversary Campaign and festive 
celebrations. 
STrATEGY AND oUTLooK
Advancing Digitalisation
Elevating our leadership on the digital front is a key priority to connect 
with our customers directly, proactively offer personalised solutions,  
increase competitiveness and elevate customer experiences. The launch 
of our digital onboarding process with pre-assessment for easy payment 
financing on September 2022 was thus a milestone for us. From January to  
February 2023, a total of 7,553 digital pre-assessment applications for  
product financing were received, which represent 7.8% of the total applications. 
By March 2023, the number of applications has surged by 28.5% to 35,735  
which is a testament of our digitalisation efforts. 
The overall project which comprises e-signature and straight through 
process is targeted to go live by the fourth quarter of FYE2024. This initiative 
will reduce end-to-end application time by 99%, and the Group’s credit  
assessment operational and manpower cost up to 50%. The digital onboarding 
for personal financing and credit cards is targeted to rollout in FYE2024.

Driving Member Expansion 
During the year, our focus on expanding membership 
base and merchant base have been revived and find tuned 
towards providing customised solutions that meet our 
customers’ lifestyles. Improved card benefits and features, 
increased placement of self-service machines and new 
customised cards to cater to different segments were also 
part of the strategy to boost the financing growth.
By working with an independent sales organisation,  
we have grown our point of sale terminal base by  
42% YoY to a total of 9,275 terminals. Further, as part of our 
expansion initiatives, customers can now apply credit 
cards at Easy Payment merchants. Through database 
analytic tools, we can cross sell credit cards to highest  
score customer segments via SMS and telemarketing 
efforts. To further optimise engagements, portable booths 
for direct sales team have been set up to improve member 
acquisition. 
Customer Centricity
AEON Credit upholds a customer-first philosophy to help 
build and increase customer loyalty, attract new customers 
and gain a competitive advantage. In order to understand 
our current performance on this front, we are monitoring 
and tracking customer experience and satisfaction levels 
through: 
•   The Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) which measures 
customer satisfaction on our services by collating SMS 
responses on loan disbursement, credit card activation/
usage, loan full settlement, and contact centre.  
The collated results showed consistent improvement 
in ratings. 
•   Google Map Review which seeks constructive feedback 
from customers visiting our branches. The FYE2023 
evaluations showed that ratings of our branches have 
improved. The number of branches rated 4-star and 
above had increased from 6 to 16. 
•   Comprehensive and continuous training programmes 
that emphasised on Customer Service fundamentals  
for frontline employees have been carried out across 
the Group to ensure they are equipped with the  
skills and knowledge to provide excellent customer 
service to customers. 
Empowering our People 
In our journey ahead, the well-being of our employees 
is our top priority and we require new talents to further 
our digital transformation. A more conducive working 
environment and culture are in the works as we  
implement a fulfilling career plan that allows our 
employees to thrive and be part of the “AEON family”. 
Initiatives include:
•  Management succession planning programme which 
included targeted development training, accelerated 
progression and mentoring as future leaders. 
•  Competency Based Training for all employees to 
build their skills and confidence as well as stay 
relevant in their roles and responsibilities. In addition,  
selected Senior Management Team members are 
given the opportunity to join coaching programmes 
conducted by a world class coaching firm.

These lay the foundation of our plans to nurture

Making Sustainable Strides
A Sustainability Framework and a 3-year Sustainability 
Roadmap have been developed to increase AEON Credit’s 
ESG impact. The Roadmap specifies objectives and  
projects that are in accordance with AEON Credit’s 
important issues and priority areas and creates the 
groundwork for the implementation of Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). 
AEON Credit has also secured a total of RM600 million 
Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) with 3-year tenure 
for the first time. AEON Credit will be incorporating 
the predetermined Sustainability Performance Targets 
(“SPTs”) into the assessment of business and financial 
performance where interest rate adjustment is subjected 
to the achievement of the preset targets. The SPTs include 
electric motorcycle financing, green financing, financial 
inclusion for hawkers and petty traders and carbon 
emission reduction. 
As part of our corporate social responsibility, we continue  
to support local communities through various 
collaborations with Malaysian AEON Foundation 
(“MAF”). We contributed RM1 million to the AEON Smart  
Classroom Project which is aimed at providing quality 
education by restoring and upgrading existing classroom 
infrastructures to bridge the education gap for students 
from low-income families. Other initiatives included 
donations to help underserved communities and  
victims of natural calamities, blood donation drives in  
collaboration with Government blood bank centre and 
environmental conservation activities such as cleaning  
the public parks, coastal and public housing areas. 
Charting a Distinctive Future
The rapidly growing demand for digital convenience is 
revolutionising the financial services industry. Customers 
are expecting more automation and instantaneous 
response from businesses. We have thus placed Customer 
Experience (“CX”) as one of our priority to assure our ability 
to retain customers, build loyalty, encourage cross selling 
and entice new joiners into the AEON ecosystem.

ThE GLoBAL ECoNoMY
The global economy has slowed down to an estimated 2.9% in 2022 after registering a rebound of 5.9% in 2021 due to  
the ongoing Russian-Ukraine hostilities, supply chain disruptions and high inflation worldwide, resulting in tightening  
of monetary policy. Continued geopolitical tensions are expected to slow down economic growth further to 1.7%.  
It has been projected that further negative shocks such as financial stress and deeper weakness in major economies could 
push global economy into recession. Global cooperation and policies are needed to support investment and long-term 
growth prospects in order to mitigate the risk of global recession and debt distress.
(Source: World Bank Report)
ThE oPErATING LANDSCAPE IN MALAYSIA
Despite weakening global growth and heightened inflationary pressure from high commodity and food prices,  
the Malaysian economy grew by 8.7% in 2022, mainly driven by domestic private consumption and recovery of the  
labour market. In 2023, the economy is projected to moderate to 4.5% amid the weaker global growth momentum. 
Growth will primarily be driven by domestic private expenditure and development expenditure.

Securing the SLL is of major significance for the 
Group as it facilitates us in contributing directly 
and promoting sustainability practices within 
our customer segments by encouraging and 
influencing deeper adoption of ESG. The SLL will 
be used as working capital for loans of which 
appraisals will be based on a pre-determined 
set of sustainability performance targets that are  
aligned to the Group’s Sustainability Framework.
The successes in FYE2023 will spur us to escalate 
our ESG efforts moving forward. The following 
initiatives are already in motion:
•  A Management Sustainability Committee 
(“MSC”) constituted with seven (7) members 
of our Top Management has been established 
to provide dedicated leadership and  
oversight over sustainability matters.
•  We have appointed an ESG consultant 
to expedite the Group’s sustainability 
implementations through the development 
of our Sustainability Strategy.
•  A 3-year Sustainability Roadmap along 
with associated initiatives, milestones 
and Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) 
has been developed. The Sustainability 
Roadmap has already been finalised and 
the Group has completed determination of  
the Scope 1 and 2 carbon emission profile.
•  The Group has also established a  
Sustainability Governance Framework to 
oversee and monitor the implementation  
of the 3-year Sustainability Roadmap.
•  Preparatory steps towards the adoption 
of the recommendations by Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(“TCFD”) reporting regime to improve 
and increase reporting of climate-related 
financial information.
INTroDUCTIoN
This Sustainability Statement (“Statement”) highlights the drivers 
for AEON Credit Service (M) Berhad’s (“AEON Credit” or “the 
Group”) sustainability agenda, the associated commitments 
and management activities and also presents the Board’s 
reflections of our sustainability achievements and performance 
as well as significant sustainability related plans moving forward. 
This Statement covers the period from 1 March 2022 to  
28 February 2023 and has been prepared with reference to  
Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa Malaysia 
Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”), specifically guidance from 
Bursa Securities’s Sustainability Reporting Guide and Global 
Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards.
The Group places strong emphasis on Environment, Social 
and Governance (“ESG”) in all that we do. ESG considerations 
take centre stage in our business strategies and operational 
plans and is embraced by all throughout the Group with  
the Board setting the tone at the top.
oUr APProACh To SUSTAINABILITY
Testifying to our embrace and practice of ESG, during the year 
under review, the Group achieved a number of notable ESG 
milestones, these are:
•  Rated A in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) 
ESG Ratings.
•  Silver winner for “The Most Consistent Performer Over 5 
Years” under the Equities category at The Edge Malaysia ESG 
Awards 2022 which recognises ESG leadership.
•  ASEAN Asset Class PLCs Award at the 2021 ASEAN  
Corporate Governance Scorecard Awards for our efforts in 
practicing good corporate governance across the Group’s 
business strategies and operations.

SUSTAINABILITY roADMAP
The Group has developed a 3-year Sustainability Roadmap with the intent of embedding ESG wider and deeper across our  
business and operations and to fulfil our sustainability commitments. Implementation of these initiatives under the  
Roadmap will directly contribute to our business sustainability and infuse it with considerations for social and  
planetary care.
The Roadmap addresses six (6) areas that can be individually identified to the core sustainability elements of  
Economy, Environment, Social and Governance (“EESG”), within each focus area we have formulated associated 
initiatives – a total of 21 initiatives – for implementation across a planned 3-year period. The diagram below illustrates  
our Sustainability Roadmap.
* Our commitment to digitalisation
The drive towards carbon neutrality is one of the focus 
area which addresses the environmental perspective of 
sustainability. Securing the SLL is a milestone achievement 
for Group and, importantly, it underscores the lenders’ 
trust and belief in our commitment towards environmental 
conservation and protection.
The SLL will facilitate the Group in contributing directly 
to and promoting sustainability practices within our 
customer segments by encouraging and influencing 
deeper adoption of green practices - our financing will 
go towards low carbon mechanisms for renewable 
energy (solar panels) and transportation (electric vehicles,  
scooters and bicycles). 
To ensure the SLL’s objectives are achieved, they 
come attached with Sustainability Performance 
Targets (“SPT”), to measure the Group’s achievement  
and impact in carbon reduction.

In line with our heightened focus on environmental 
conservation, the Group has completed developing both 
our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emission profile for FYE2022 
and FYE2023 which are illustrated in the table below.  
The emission profiles provide an important information 
for the Group to formulate and execute our carbon 
management measures in particular, managing electricity 
consumption which is the main source of the Group’s 
carbon emissions.

Play an integral part in meeting the needs of the 
local community for financial services through our 
business operations, adopting sound governance 
practices with a focus on customer experience  
and innovation.
Become more employee-centric by taking care 
of and developing employees, including fostering 
a culture amongst employees to become better 
people and community members.
Demonstrate how the Group gives back to 
the local community through activities which 
contribute to society in line with AEON’s basic 
principles of pursuing peace, respecting humanity 
and contributing to local communities, always with 
the customer’s point of view as its core.
Implement environmental management initiatives 
to protect the environment and minimise impact 
on the environment from our operations.
The notable increase in carbon emission 
is principally due to a resumption of the 
Group’s business activities to gradually reach  
pre-pandemic levels across FYE2023.
The Group has also made preparatory efforts 
towards adopting recommendations by the 
TCFD reporting to enhance sustainability  
through inclusion of climate-related financial 
information.
oUr APProACh To SUSTAINABILITY
The Group is guided by our basic principles 
of pursuing peace, respecting humanity and 
contributing to communities always with the 
interests of the customers at its core aligned 
with the objective of realising a sustainable 
society. In addition, we are also guided by the  
philosophy of our parent company, AEON 
Financial Service Co., Ltd. to support customers’ 
lifestyles and enable each individual to maximise 
future opportunities through effective use 
of credit. From a sustainability perspective,  
the foregoing is brought to life through our 
practice of responsible lending and financial 
inclusion, for instance our AEON Privilege  
Card for Hawkers and Petty Traders equips 
hawkers and petty traders with capabilities to 
accept cashless payments ensuring they are  
not left behind in the nation’s drive towards 
electronic payments.
We recognise the importance of embedding 
the sustainability elements into our business 
model and daily operations. To emphasise and  
formalise our commitment to sustainability we 
have framed the following commitment that 
applies to all the Group’s constituents.
The Group, has a fundamental goal, indeed a responsibility,  
to generate long-term value for our diverse stakeholders. We also 
recognise an inherent obligation to create value in a sustainable, 
ethical and responsible manner. In this regard, we maintain 
a relentless focus on constantly achieving a delicate balance  
between economic performance and sustainability developments 
so that financial objectives are achieved without compromising  
the equally important ESG considerations.
In addition, we realise that sustainability asserts a significant 
influence on the Group’s business longevity and hence our ability 
to continue generating value, lending credence to the fact that 
without sustainability in business, the business is not sustainable.
To uphold our responsibility to create value in a sustainable,  
ethical and responsible manner, we will:

Setting the Tone at the Top
At AEON Credit, sustainability starts at the highest level to 
explicitly signal commitment and ownership. Top level embrace of 
sustainability lends credibility to the Group’s sustainability actions, 
promoting support and expedites assimilation across all corners  
of the Group – this also epitomises how our business is governed 
and managed. The Group’s Leadership from the Board through  
to the Managing Director (“MD”) and the Top Management team  
all take active part in shaping and embodying our sustainability 
agenda.

In FYE2022, to deepen the involvement of Top Management 
in sustainability oversight and as an acknowledgement 
that sustainability warrants stronger and more dedicated 
attention, a Management Sustainability Committee 
(“MSC”) was established. The MSC’s members comprise 
the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief 
Corporate Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief Risk Officer 
and Head of IT Division. The MD serves as the advisor to 
the MSC.
Led by the Group’s Leadership, in particular the Board 
Risk Committee (“BRC”), we continue to raise the bar on 
sustainability to realise our duty of care for society and the 
environment.
Sustainability Governance
Sustainability Governance is exercised through a 
well-thought-out governance structure that involves 
participation from the highest level through to 
business units. This structure facilitates the proper 
enforcement and compliance to sustainability policies 
as well as effective oversight over the implementation 
of sustainability initiatives and fulfillment of our  
sustainability commitments. 
The Sustainability Governance Structure along with the roles and responsibilities of each component therein is further 
illustrated below:

The Board recognises the importance of pursuing 
a business sustainability agenda and sets the tone

ESG aspects of the business in decision making.  
Supporting the Board is the BRC, which also has  
purview over sustainability matters. The BRC is also 
responsible for reviewing sustainability policies and plans 
and to monitor the performance of their execution.
Top Management is represented in the MSC which is 
responsible for driving improvements and execution 
of the Group’s overall sustainability strategies and  
associated initiatives. Management members individually 
and collectively play an active role to ensure that 
sustainability is part of AEON Credit’s business approach 
and is infused into the Group’s daily operations. 
A Sustainability Working Committee (“SWC”) comprising 
key management personnel from business units supports 
our sustainability strategy development and executes 
sustainability initiatives. The SWC reports progress to 
and seeks guidance from the MSC and BRC, as the case 
may be, when required. The SWC also plays an important 
role in raising sustainability awareness and embedding 
sustainability practices across the Group’s operations 
as well as embedding management practices to address 
any potential sustainability impact arising from operations.

MATErIAL SUSTAINABILITY MATTErS
The Group conducts an annual materiality assessment to identify material sustainability matters, to ascertain if those 
identified in the previous year still have continuing relevance and to take cognisance of matters that emerged in  
the current year that have gained significance. The review also considers matters arising during our stakeholder  
engagements to ensure that the material sustainability matters are balanced and feedback from our stakeholders are  
being incorporated. The following process is adopted in conducting the materiality assessment:
Identification Stakeholder 
Engagement Prioritisation
Workshop held with 
the Management

 CoNDUCT AND TrUST
As a leading financial services provider, ethical and responsible behaviour has always been paramount to the Group. 
We place great importance in ensuring our customers are fully informed and their interests are secured and protected.  
This is critical to preserving our good name and reputation in the market as our sustainability and continued  
growth as a business hinges significantly on having an impeccable reputation. We spare no effort in ensuring that 
we comply with all laws and regulations governing our business. The Group’s workforce and our business associates 
are mandated to conduct themselves ethically, professionally and with integrity. This also has a significant bearing  
on our reputation and how we are perceived by our stakeholders. Hence, it is imperative that our conduct reflects 
strong corporate governance and commitment to be good corporate citizens.
There are four (4) material sustainability matters under our Conduct and Trust pillar:
(a)  Data Security, IT Infrastructure & Digital 
Transformation
 (i)  Business Continuity Management and Cyber 
Security
   The Group operates in a business environment 
that is intensely competitive, where digital service 
and product delivery channels are ubiquitous 
and 24/7 availability is the norm. The application 
and leverage of information technology (“IT”) is 
a “business as usual” expectation in the financial 
services industry and indeed, a key factor 
in securing customer loyalty and retention.  
The Group recognises this critical change in 
our customers’ demands and has responded by 
instituting a Digital Transformation Programme. 
This Programme which is currently on-going 
aims to widen and deepen digitalisation across 
our operations. Notably, initiatives under this 
Programme were instrumental to ensuring that 
the Group ably weathered the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions across the past 
two years by providing contactless, electronic 
channels to conduct business and continued 
customer interactions.
   The COVID-19 pandemic has promoted the 
ubiquitous and widespread use of contactless, 
electronic channels. As the pandemic abates, 
it has left an enduring effect in the form of the 
increased and embedded use of electronic means 
of interaction and transacting. The deepened 
ubiquity of electronic channels has become a 
distinctive characteristic of the new normal and 
is aligned to our Digital Transformation strategy. 
The increased use of online and digital platforms 
for service delivery and communication makes 
it imperative for the Group to ensure security  
around online transactions. 
   Digitalisation and the wider application of IT and 
has, in tandem, brought a critical need for the 
constant strengthening of our cyber security 
to ensure the Group’s systems and data are 
secured and protected against malicious attacks.  
The Group places great importance in ensuring 
the continuity of all critical business functions 
and essential services. In this regard, we have 
put in place policies, processes and systems 
under the Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”),  
Disaster Recovery Plan and Cyber Incidents 
Response Plan to respond to a range of  
unexpected disruptions and ensure continuous 
uninterrupted conduct of business and provision 
of services to our customers. 
   A dedicated back-up site with all requisite 
infrastructure and services for back-up operations 
under the BCP has been established by the Group. 
Full BCP testing is executed annually during 
which all Critical Business Functions (“CBF”) were 
tested to ensure they are accessible to conduct 
live transactions. The Group successfully 
conducted BCP testing in January 2023 in 
accordance with Bank Negara Malaysia’s (“BNM”) 
Business Continuity Management guidelines 
and internal procedures. The BCP witnessed 
the increased mobilisation of staff from CBF so 
that test results are more comprehensive and 
reflective of actual operational circumstances, 
which in turn, facilitates more effective  
formulation and implementation of indicated 
remedial actions.

TO GOOD CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE


---- Page 64 ----
   In response to the growing sophistication of  
cyber threats, the Group has strengthened 
vigilance and surveillance capabilities to execute 
immediate and appropriate responses to threats 
as well as to build preparedness to emerging  
threats, these will collectively ensure the 
continuous availability of services and provide 
comfort that both customer and the Group’s 
data are adequately protected. We have a 24/7 
IT Security Operation Centre to monitor cyber 
related attacks on real time basis for immediate 
responses. Stringent security measures are also in 
place on all personal computers and IT Security 
tools such as Data Loss Prevention, File Integrity 
Management and Intrusion Prevention System 
have been deployed to safeguard and protect 
against any cyber-attack.
   To evaluate the effectiveness of security measures 
and cyber threat mitigation plans, the Group 
conducts Cyber Crisis Simulation exercises to 
test our readiness to respond to cyber-attack 
scenarios that are most likely to impact the Group.  
The Group’s annual cyber security drill was 
conducted in February 2022 with heightened 
scenario severity to more comprehensively test  on 
our cyber security posture.
   Subsequently in FYE2023, a role play simulation 
with the scenario “Ransomware attack which 
crippled production, disaster recovery as 
well as the end users access” was conducted 
with the Crisis Management Team as well as 
relevant key stakeholders. This has yielded 
a more practical approach to combatting  
cyber-attacks and actions to further strengthen 
the cyber security incident response team. 
 (ii) Customer Data Protection
   Being significantly retail oriented, the Group has 
a significant base of customers that will continue 
to grow as the Group expands. As a consequence, 
the Group has also built up a substantial customer 
database which will continue to grow as the 
Group expands its business growth. By leveraging 
on data analytics tools, the Group will be able to 
gather richer and more granular data to discover 
better ways to meet our customers’ needs and 
expectations in order to serve them better.  
Given the foregoing, it is imperative to secure  
the confidentiality and privacy of these data  
and to protect and prevent exposure to  
intrusions, theft and misuse. 
   The Group is certified in ISO 27001:2013 
Information Security Management Systems (“ISMS”) 
which validates the structured processes in 
place to safeguard information and data security. 
This certification was successfully recertified 
by an independent third party certification 
body in FYE2023. The ISMS certification also 
provides assurance to both internal and external 
stakeholders of the Group’s information security 
management and risk mitigations.
   Confidentiality, privacy, integrity and availability 
of critical information are fundamental principles 
enshrined in the Group’s Integrated Management 
System Policy. The Personal Data Protection Act 
2010 and secrecy provisions under the Financial 
Services Act 2013 govern our customer data 
management policies and processes. 
   Training and awareness programmes are regularly 
conducted as a matter of course to continuously 
enhance employees’ understanding and build 
awareness of the Group’s policies and processes 
in place to manage the handling and storage 
of customer and business information at every 
stage of the information lifecycle, as well as 
the processes for reporting security breaches. 
Importantly, the training also serves to reinforce 
responsibilities for customer data protection and 
the consequences of failing to do so. 
(b) Excellent Ethics, Governance, risk & Compliance
 (i) AEoN Code of Conduct
   The AEON Code of Conduct (“CoC”) dictates 
the Group’s stringent standards on how we 
conduct business and is mandatory for all  
the Group’s employees. The CoC documents 
the Group’s principles of good governance,  
integrity and ethical and responsible conduct  
that is mandated for all employees to follow at 
all times to earn stakeholders’ confidence and  
uphold our reputation as a good corporate 
citizen of impeccable standing. As well, the CoC 
epitomises AEON Credit’s corporate philosophy 
and approach to business in conducting 
operations with integrity and fair dealings with 
all stakeholders. The CoC is an integral part of 
newly on-boarded employees’ induction training 
and orientation programmes which is thereafter 
reinforced through annual CoC refresher  
training sessions aimed at continually embedding 
principles of good governance, ethics and 
integrity.

 (ii) Anti-Bribery Management System
   Since March 2020, AEON Credit has been 
certified in ISO 37001:2016 – Anti-Bribery 
Management Systems (“ABMS”). This certification 
validates the processes in place to prevent, 
detect, and address events of bribery.  
Our ABMS reinforces our basic integrity principle 
and embeds an anti-bribery culture within the 
Group. The ABMS also facilitates compliance 
to adequate procedures requirement under  
Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission (“MACC”) Act 2009, which contains 
a corporate liability provision for bribery and 
corruption. 
   The ABMS embeds within our employees and 
business associates a responsibility to carry out 
their duties conscientiously and responsibly to 
mitigate the risk of corrupt activities or actions.  
We conduct Anti-Bribery Risk Assessment  
annually to identify potential risks and assess the 
adequacy of controls in place, with the aim of 
strengthening the existing Group policies and 
procedures, where weaknesses and deficiencies 
are observed. The Group’s ISO 37001:2016 
ABMS certification was successfully recertified in 
FYE2023 by an independent certification body.
   Training is regularly provided to reinforce 
requirements of the policy of ABMS and 
to continuously promote and embed an  
anti-bribery culture. 
   The following initiatives were conducted in 
FYE2023 in relation to anti-bribery:
  •  An anti-bribery awareness e-Learning 
session was conducted with a significant 
90% of attendees satisfactorily passed the 
accompanying evaluation;
  •  The annual anti-bribery e-Learning was 
completed in December 2022 where  
3,055 out of a total of 3,078 participants 
passed the accompanying evaluation,  
representing a passing rate of 99%.  
11% (335) of the participants were from 
our management level with the remaining  
89% (2,743) were non-management; and
  •  Initiation of the annual Anti-Bribery Pledge 
for both internal (via online submission of  
Anti-Bribery Pledge) and external stakeholders 
(via completion of Integrity Declaration). 
   In FYE2023, there was no reported case of 
corrupt act by any Group employee and,  
in line with the Group’s integrity principle,  
no political contributions were made either 
directly or indirectly by the Group.
   AEON Credit’s policy of ABMS which was  
approved by the Board and communicated to all 
employees, business associates and stakeholders, 
is available on the Company’s website under 
Corporate Policies section at https://www.
aeoncredit.com.my/aeon-corporate/corporate-
policies/anti-bribery-policy or scan the QR code

 (iii) Compliance
   As a financial services provider, like every 
similar enterprise across the world, the Group is 
governed and subject to stringent regulations  
and compliance requirements to ensure our 
nation’s continuing economic stability and to 
protect our customers’ interests. Regulatory 
oversight of our business and operations is 
performed by, amongst others, BNM, Bursa 
Securities and Kementerian Perdagangan Dalam 
Negeri & Hal Ehwal Pengguna. 
   The BRC is entrusted to support the Board in 
oversight of risk management and compliance 
and, in this regard, exercises dedicated and 
constant vigilance to ensure risks inherent to 
our business are appropriately managed and 
balanced against our economic objectives.  
As well, the BRC conducts constant monitoring 
to ensure the Group satisfactorily complies  
with all governing laws and regulations.
   Given the strategic nature of our business 
and its impact on the nation’s economy,  
non-compliance to laws and regulations can 
have a devastating impact on our sustainability 
as a business and put the interests of the  
Group’s stakeholders at risk. To ensure  
continuous compliance, the Board has approved 
the  Compliance Framework which governs 
processes that drive compliance across the  
Group’s business and operations. Group-wide 
training and awareness activities were conducted 
to reinforce accountability and ownership of 
compliance processes across business units as 
well as to inculcate a risk-aware culture.

   Maintaining our FYE2022 performance, in FYE2023 
there were no instance of non-compliance to 
any law, policy or regulatory guideline issued by  
AEON Credit’s oversight authorities.
   The Legal and Compliance Department, and the 
Sustainability and Risk Management Department, 
work in collaboration with business units in 
monitoring and managing compliance risks 
through conducting periodic reviews of related 
policies and internal controls. 
 (iv) Whistle-Blowing Channels
   In line with good practices for corporate 
safeguards against wrongdoing or risky or 
unethical behaviour, AEON Credit has instituted 
range of whistle-blowing channels so as to  
provide ease of access and better alignment 
with reporting parties’ specific preference.  
These channels include:
  •  AEON Code of Conduct Hotline through 
which employees can draw attention to 
genuine concerns on any illegal or unethical 
practice, financial fraud, irregularity or  
breach of regulations, anonymously or 
otherwise and without fear of reprisals; 
  •  Email to the Senior Independent Director at 
eSID@aeoncredit.com.my, this channel is 
available to any business partner, customer, 
other stakeholder or member of the public 
who has knowledge of any irregularity or 
improper conduct; 
  •  Reporting to the Business Ethics Team,  
HQ AEON Co., Ltd., Japan through the  
online portal: http://aeon-ethics.secure.
force.com/, this channel serves as a platform 
for all employees including business partners 
to report any misconduct (including violations 
of laws and internal policies) by the Top 
Management (Senior General Manager and 
above) direct to AEON Group Japan; 
  •  Legal Attorney Hotline: report_aeonglobal@
yglpc.com, this channel directs reports to 
an external legal attorney commissioned by 
the Group to receive the e-mailed reports  
which will be forwarded to the Group’s  
COC Promotion Officer for further action; 
and
  •   Letter addressed to Chief Risk Officer,  
AEON Credit Service (M) Berhad. 
  All reports will be investigated in a confidential  
manner with the appropriate whistle blower safeguards 
and protections in place and further action will be 
taken, where necessary.
In FYE2023 there were 21 reports received on our 
whistle-blowing channels that were investigated and 
brought to proper closure.
(c)  Business Innovation, responsible Marketing, 
Product & Service Design
 (i) r esponsible Financing/Financial Inclusion
   Competitive advantage in the financial services 
industry is driven to a significant extent by 
innovation. Accordingly constant innovation is 
critical for the sustainability and expansion of the 
Group’s business. Innovation is also important  
for the Group to enlarge and protect our  
market share.
   The Group relentlessly focus on developing 
innovative new and enhanced products and  
services to meet our customers’ evolving  
demands and to develop novel approaches 
to customer interaction to enrich their 
experience when dealing with the Group. 
Our product and service development efforts 
are guided by our commitment to financial 
inclusion, witness our AEON Privilege 
Card for Hawkers and Petty Traders that  
equips hawkers and petty traders with 
capabilities to accept cashless payments 
ensuring they are not left behind in the 
nation’s drive towards electronic payments.  
We have also formulated an initiative under our 
3-year Sustainability Roadmap to develop and 
embed financial literacy among entrepreneurs as 
part of our commitment to financial inclusion.
   The Group has always been ahead of its time in 
serving certain segments of the underserved 
market. Over the years, our involvement with the 
underserved market has afforded us a significant 
understanding of the characteristics and needs 
of this market which we have leveraged to build 
capabilities to serve them more effectively along 
with capabilities to manage and mitigate risks 
unique to this community.

---- Page 67 ----
   In all cases, our marketing and customer 
prospecting efforts are tempered with a 
strong sense of responsibility to ensure that 
our customers’ exposures are manageable 
and aligns with their servicing capabilities.  
Clear and concise product information is  
provided to customers to ensure important 
information and risk disclosures are highlighted 
and understood. Employees are equipped with 
sound knowledge of product features and ethics 
to promote the products based on customer 
needs and provide requisite information to 
customers to help them in their decision making 
and to understand their obligations. 
   Justified financial assistance and aid to weather 
challenges and difficult times is also, to the 
Group, a form of financial inclusion, in fact 
one that serves a higher humanitarian cause 
- supporting those economically impacted by 
the COVID-19 pandemic is a compelling case in  
point. Although the pandemic started to 
abate in early FYE2022 leading to the country  
transitioning to the endemic phase, the lagging 
effects of the pandemic was still experienced  
by vulnerable groups.
   Accordingly, in FYE2023, the Group’s financial 
assistance and aid efforts were focused on 
event-triggered activities, specifically supporting 
customers affected by the pandemic imposed 
restrictions. The Group engages with affected 
customers to discuss, and where appropriate, 
propose “debt restructuring” or “rescheduling” 
programmes in order to facilitate them in  
meeting their obligations. In this regard, 
customers also have access to Agensi Kaunseling 
dan Pengurusan Kredit (“AKPK”) for advice on 
managing their obligations.
   AEON Credit remains committed towards 
providing suitable, affordable and quality financial 
services to targeted customer segments.  
The Group promotes inclusive finance where all 
segments of society, including the lower income 
group, have convenient access to suitable and  
affordable financial services in contributing 
towards equitable and sustainable growth. 
 (d)  Transparency in Procurement Process
  (i) Procurement Governance
    AEON Credit practices and enforces 
transparency in our procurement process 
to ensure equitable treatment of suppliers 
and vendors. We manage our procurement 
professionally and ethically in a manner 
consistent with best practices. Procurement  
of goods and services amounting to  
RM200,000 and above must be reviewed 
and approved by our Tender & Procurement 
Committee to ensure transparency and 
fair evaluation in the vendor and supplier 
selection process. Additionally, all confidential 
information both internal and external related 
to the procurement must be strictly protected 
and only used for the purpose for which it  
was provided. 
  (ii) Proportion of Local Procurement 
    AEON Credit has a commitment to source 
and procure from local vendors and suppliers 
to support their continued development 
and contribute to national economic 
development. In FYE2023, payments to  
foreign suppliers and vendors further  
declined to 6% of total payments compared  
to the 7% recorded in the previous  
year in spite of a 4% increase in total payments.

 CUSToMEr EXPErIENCE
Excellent customer experience is an imperative across the Group. Our basic principles has the customer as the 
core focus – we bring this to life every day in all that we do. The Group strives to deliver beyond our customers’ 
expectations and in the process provides an excellent customer experience. We hold a strong conviction that  
excellent customer experience is foundational to building customer loyalty, customer retention, increasing the  
Group’s market share, enlarging our customer base and consequently, achieving revenue growth. 
In addition, it is an acknowledged fact that customer experience excellence is a significant differentiator,  
especially so in our intensely competitive industry. The Group has two (2) material sustainability matters  
under our Customer Experience pillar:
2
(a)  Excellent Customer Experience, Support & Access
 (i) Service Convenience and Customer Feedback
   Understanding our customers is the bedrock 
of our business approach, we continually 
seek to understand our customers’ needs, 
their expectations and where we can further 
improve. We recognise that only with an intimate 
understanding of our customers can we frame 
product and service propositions that are targeted 
to meet their requirements. In this regard, we place 
strong emphasis on a two-way relationship with 
customers and value their objectives and honest 
feedback. Such feedback spurs us to continuously 
improve so as to enhance our value propositions 
and service quality. The Group has in place a  
variety of touchpoints to facilitate customer 
contact.

   In keeping with customer demands for  
24/7 availability and convenience of access,  
we have facilitated secure online transacting 
and interactions – this is also driven by the 
need for contactless remote access during the  
COVID-19 pandemic and, in the new normal, 
is here to stay. An initiative launched in 
FYE2023 was the Google Ratings tracking for  
all our branches nationwide to provide the 
Group with insights from customer reviews of 
our branches – this will facilitate the institution 
of improvements, where indicated to further 
enhance customer experience.
 (ii) Customer Service Focus
   In support of continually maintaining high 
standards in customer service, the Group has 
attained the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management 
Systems certification. This certification,  
which ensure customer service processes are 
consistent and always kept at high standards 
was successfully recertified in FYE2023 by an 
independent third party certification body. 
   Our customer-facing employees lie at the 
frontline of customer interactions. Our frontliners 
give customers their first impression of the Group 
and their behaviour, approach and orientation 
are invariably taken as being representative 
of the Group. Hence, the Group takes great 
pain in shaping, training and developing our 
frontliners to be good ambassadors of the Group.  
Customer service programmes and initiatives 
are an integral part of inducting newly recruited 
frontliners and continuously developing the 
incumbents.

   The Group conducts mandatory training on 
customer management and customer service 
to all new recruits in frontline roles who interact 
with customers and business partners. In addition, 
soft skills training is also routinely conducted for 
existing employees and new hires. The following 
customer service training were conducted in 
FYE2023:
  i.  customer handling management 
  ii. fundamentals of customer service (soft skills)
(b)  Business Innovation, responsible Marketing, 
Product & Service Design
  Innovation is an inescapable requirement for 
the Group to continue to thrive in the financial 
services industry and be sustainable as a business.  
Against a backdrop of intense competition and 
customers that are increasingly demanding and 
sophisticated, innovation is critical for the Group to 
maintain our position as a leading financial services 
provider. Absent innovation, customer churn will 
take place eroding the Group’s ability to continue 
generating value for our stakeholders.
  The Group relentlessly pursues innovative ideas 
in developing new product and service offerings 
in order to acquire new customers and originate 
new business while retaining our existing valued  
customers. Our innovative spirit is best epitomised by 
financial inclusion products, targeting the underserved 
market, that we have introduced, for instance credit 
products for the new-to-workforce or new-to-credit 
segments as well as the aforementioned AEON 
Privilege Card for Hawkers and Petty Traders.
  The Group’s Digital Transformation Programme 
has been pivotal in our efforts to innovate. We are 
adopting and widening digitalisation as an intrinsic 
part of our continuing efforts to enhance our product 
and service offerings and bring greater convenience,  
ease of access and enhanced benefits to our  
customers. This is articulated in greater detail below 
under our Digital Product and Service Transformation 
sustainability pillar. 
  As we innovate in our product and service offerings, 
responsible features, terms and conditions takes  
centre stage to ensure that dealings with our  
customers are on fair and equitable terms. The Group  
recognises that the experience we give to our 
customers hinges significantly on the integrity with 
which our products and services are marketed and  
the care that goes into their design. The Group takes 
great pains in designing fit-for-purpose products 
and services that align with the requirements of our 
customers both in terms of meeting their financial 
needs as well as their need for transparency, 
predictability and clarity.
  We adopt a responsible and transparent approach 
to marketing our products and services and 
provide our customers with full information on the 
associated terms and conditions to support them in 
reaching an informed decision before committing.  
Collectively, our efforts have the overarching intent 
of ensuring fair treatment to our customers and leave 
them with a favourable impression which, in turn,  
will encourage loyalty and promote customer 
“stickiness”.
  This material matter is also applicable to our  
Conduct and Trust sustainability pillar and is articulated  
in greater detail therein.

 DIGITAL ProDUCT AND SErVICE TrANSForMATIoN
Digitalisation has become the norm across enterprises globally, both public and private. The emergence of new 
technologies and their maturity has provided the impetus for businesses to leverage these technologies to enhance 
revenue, optimise cost, improve operational efficiency and sharpen their competitive edge. Financial services 
is one of the industries at the forefront of digitalisation and adoption of proven new technologies and the Group  
is keeping pace through our Digital Transformation Programme.
Our digitally-focused Transformation Programme is a strategic imperative and a prerequisite for the Group to 
compete effective against our competitors who are also heavily invested in digitalisation. Additionally, digitalisation 
facilitates cost optimisation and enhances operational efficiency, both of which are critical to ensuring that the  
Group continues to generate reasonable returns from our business given that revenue pressures are constant in our 
intensely competitive industry. The Group has two (2) material sustainability matters under the Digital Product and 
Service Transformation pillar:
3
(a)  Business Innovation, responsible Marketing, 
Product & Service Design
  Digitalisation is pivotal to translating the Group’s 
innovation concepts and ideas into reality in the 
form of new products and services, enhancements 
in customer service and experience as well as  
improved operational efficiency. As a key enabler, 
digitalisation also facilitates the Group in bringing to 
life our financial inclusion efforts as is evident in our 
AEON Privilege Card for Hawkers and Petty Traders 
offering.
  In tandem with our continuing Digital Transformation, 
the Group places continuous attention to building 
and strengthening our digital capabilities within 
our workforce to ensure that skills are kept current 
and aligned to our priorities and strategic direction. 
Alongside digitalisation, the Group has also placed 
intense focus on continually strengthening our cyber 
security stance to safeguard the security and integrity 
of our systems and protect data from cyber risks.
  The Group considers our Digital Transformation 
Programme as a journey to widen and deepen 
the leverage of digital technologies across all 
facets of our operations over time. The journey 
continued in FYE2023 with the implementation  
of the following initiatives:
 •  Easy Payment (“EP”) self-e-KYC - which allows 
customers to perform the KYC processes at 
their own leisure without the need to visit 
the merchant sites. As well, merchants can 
reach their customers easily for completion  
of KYC processes faster and more securely.
 •  Embedded AEON Wallet functions into iAEON,  
the AEON Group’s mobile app for AEON 
Retail which combines payment, points, store 
information and financing application.
 •  Facilitating application for AEON Member Plus 
Visa Card (“AMP”), Personal Financing and Credit  
Card via mobile app and enabling user to perform 
“Scan & Pay” via QR code at all AEON Retail 
Outlets.
 •  Peer-to-Peer transfer – a facility targeted at  
AMP Visa card users with AEON Wallet to allow 
fund transfers between AMP card users.
 •  Unique referral code – a functionality to allow 
AEON Credit to tap on our existing user base 
to market the AEON Wallet mobile application. 
 •  Virtual Express Card via AEON Wallet which 
enhances ease and convenience for AEON 
Express Card holders through the provision  
of a virtual card.
 •  Redesigned AEON Wallet user interface 
(“UI”) and user experience (“UX”) for better  
user experience.
 •  Implementation of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) 
technology to advance consumer behavior 
analysis in order to support targeted marketing  
and effective cross selling, and improving 
customer onboarding speed and experience.

---- Page 71 ----
  As the Group continues to progress in our Digital 
Transformation journey, the following initiatives are in 
the pipeline for FYE2024:
 •  Additional functionalities for AEON Wallet: Inbox, 
In-app Tutorial, e-Donation, Financing Repayment, 
and Peer-to-Peer payment functions; and
 •  Further enhancements to EP self-KYC for greater 
operational efficiency while improving the overall 
user experience for customers and merchants.
  As always, in developing and designing new and 
enhanced products and services, the requisite 
due diligence is exercised to ensure that they  
embed and reflect the Group’s responsibility for 
excellent ethics, fair dealings and sustainability both 
on the part of the Group and our customers.
(b)  Excellent Customer Experience, Support and 
Access
  Our Digital Transformation Programme has a specific 
focus on customers in line with our basic principle 
of placing our customers at the core. The Group is 
continuously working on enhancing our customers’ 
experience and providing them with products and 
services that are relevant and most importantly, 
meet their needs. For instance as noted above,  
we have embarked on an initiative to apply AI in 
customer behaviour analytics to determine ways 
to improve our products, their associated features 
and develop more effective and targeted customer 
servicing approaches. Our capabilities, which we 
continuously improve, have extended to providing 
customers with the convenience of 24/7 availability 
anytime, anywhere access through a range of devices. 
  It is notable that our digital transformation efforts 
commenced ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and our efforts – the digital platforms developed –  
came to fruition in time to support business  
continuity. Thus, customer interaction, servicing and 
transacting, were effectively supported and largely 
uninterrupted across the period of the pandemic. 
  Significantly, the use of our digital platforms during 
the pandemic also had the effect of building  
familiarity in electronic transacting and interacting 
within our customer base and, in the process,  
provided them with the comfort and assurance of 
security. This has driven increased customer uptake 
and an attendant increase in the Group’s electronic 
transaction volumes. Besides, digitalisation has fortified 
the Group’s sustainability as a business and provided us 
with capabilities to compete effectively in the market.

 EMPLoYEE hEALTh, SAFETY & WELL-BEING
Our workforce is undeniably the Group’s backbone, we are defined by the excellence of our people.  
Accordingly, it is incumbent on us to secure their well-being and keep them engaged and passionate about  
delivering their best at all times. The Group recognises the central role a skilled and competent workforce plays 
an important role in fortifying our business sustainability and resilience. We intend to attract, nurture and retain the  
best talent to take our business forward. Reciprocating our workforce’s contributions and in recognition of their  
efforts we strive to provide them with a competitive remuneration and support their continuing development of  
skills and competencies.
Equality as well as diversity and inclusion underpin our Human Resources policies. Further, the Group recognises 
the importance of workplace safety to the health of our workforce and acknowledges this as an intrinsic part of  
our responsibility to care for the well-being of our people. There are two (2) material sustainability matters under  
the Employee Health, Safety and Well-being pillar:
4
(a) Employee health, Safety & Well-being
 (i) occupational Safety and health
All employees are covered under the Group’s 
Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) 
Management System, similar to FYE2022.
   AEON Credit’s OSH Policy reaffirms our 
commitment to provide a safe and conducive 
working environment for all employees and 
safeguard customers and visitors from potential 
hazards caused by the Group’s business activities. 
   The Group’s Emergency Response, Safety 
and Health and Housekeeping Guidelines 
(“ERSH”) Committee chaired by the MD has, as 
their principal responsibility, formulated and  
reviewed the Group’s OSH Policy with  reference 
to the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994. 
   Detailed guidelines in relation to hazard 
identification and risk assessment are outlined 
in the ERSH document to support the 
maintenance of a safe workplace. The Group 
also endeavours to provide a safe and conducive 
working environment for all its employees and  
non-employees alike. The Group conducts 
audits on a need basis on incident investigation,  
hazard identification and risks assessment relating 
to incidents, to determine corrective actions and 
improvements needed in the OSH Management 
System. 
   The Group conducts occupational health and 
safety training for our employees, including 
generic training, training on specific work-related 
hazards, hazardous activities and hazardous 
situations. Office Emergency and Safety briefings 
are also mandatory for new joiners, these are run 
concurrently with their induction programme. 
All appointed Fire Marshalls are given training 
on Essential First Aid and Fire Marshall Refresher 
Course on a periodic basis. The following  
OSH-related training were conducted in FYE2023:
  •  In collaboration with Cert Academy, a leading 
local first aid and safety related training 
provider, the Group conducted a two-day 
basic occupational first aid, Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation (“CPR”) and Automated External 
Defibrillator (“AED”) training across several 
regions to enhance our employees’ first aid 
knowledge. This knowledge is essential for 
first responders to emergencies; and 
  •  Fire Marshall training.
 (ii) CoVID-19 Preventive Measures 
   The COVID-19 pandemic started to abate in early 
2022 following widespread vaccinations and the 
administration of the third and fourth booster 
shots. As a result, the Government started a 
gradual relaxation of the imposed restrictions.  
Business and economic activities resumed and 
the Group also aligned our containment and 
preventive measures in line with the relaxation. 
Nevertheless, caution and diligence are still 
the order of the day and preventive measures 
are adopted as demanded by circumstances.  
As a precaution, the Group continues to provide 
personal hygiene facilities.

(b)  Employee Benefits, Employee Engagement 
Programmes
 (i) Workforce Diversity
   The Group celebrates diversity and inclusivity 
in our workforce, our approach to diversity is 
anchored on respect, equality and inclusion.  
To this end, the Group adopts an equal opportunity 
approach to employment, renumeration and job 
progression and no discrimination is tolerated 
regardless of race, creed, class or any other  
form of differentiation. In line with the Group’s 
CoC, we respect the rights of every individual 
and foster diversity and inclusivity with the aim 
of building a harmonious, dynamic and strong 
workforce. 
   The Group recognises that diverse talent is 
necessary to innovate and compete in a rapidly 
changing business landscape. By promoting 
inclusivity and equality in the workplace,  
our employees will be happier and more  
comfortable in their working environment.  
Thus, creating a diverse workforce can  
contribute to increased retention, motivation 
and productivity as well as enhance the Group’s 
responsiveness to an increasingly diverse 
customer base and expand the creativity of the 
organisation. 
   The gender composition of the Group’s workforce 
has remained relatively stable year-on-year.  
At the end of FYE2023, the gender ratio was  
34% male : 66% female while at the end of the 
previous year, the ratio stood at 35% male : 65% 
female. 
   The gender composition at the senior 
management level shows a better gender balance 
in FYE2023 with a ratio of 57% male : 43% female 
which compares favourably against FYE2022’s 
ratio of 77% male : 23% female. The increase in 
the number of females in senior management

testifies to the Group’s commitment and efforts 
in achieving a better gender balance for this 
level. More importantly, the more balanced 
gender composition explicitly reflects the  
Group’s recognition of the importance of  
women in leadership and their ability to  
contribute.

 (iv) Employee Engagement
   Employee engagement is foundational to keeping 
employees motivated and building a sense of 
belonging. Constant engagement creates a strong 
emotional bond between the Group and our 
employees which promotes higher productivity, 
contribution and serves as a motivational force  
to spur our workforce to greater heights.
   The Group understands the significance of 
constant, open two-way communications with 
employees and, to this end, has put in place 
communication channels to give voice to our 
employees, hear their concerns and receive  
open and honest feedback.
   We spare no efforts in ensuring our employees 
are continually engaged. It is an acknowledged 
fact that a good employee experience goes a  
long way towards attracting and retaining top 
talent. To this end, we have instituted a range of 
mechanisms across the employment lifecycle to 
deliver an enriching and rewarding experience 
to keep our employees engaged and passionate 
about being part of AEON Credit which in turn, 
drives long term sustainable growth.

   As part of our Digital Transformation Programme, 
our FlexHR mobile app was launched in  
November 2022 to support ease of employee 
communication and engagement – this serves 
to emphasise that back-office efficiency also 
receives focus in our digitalisation efforts. FlexHR 
facilitates:  
Employee access to the Human 
Resource Information System 
(“HRIS”) anytime and anywhere 
through their mobile devices
Employee communication and 
engagement, for instance,  
new developments within the  
Group and announcements
Enhancement in employee 
management and streamlined 
automated processes
Employee self-service such as 
access to pay slips (“mPayslipz”), 
ability to file claims (“mClaimz”), 
leave application (“mLeavz”) an 
updates on pending HRIS tasks
   The Group had an Employee Suggestion  
Programme (“ESP”) to encourage employees to 
contribute constructive ideas for operational 
improvements. As an enhancement in the 
continuing evolution of the Group’s employee 
feedback mechanism, the Group has replaced  
the ESP with a monthly dialogue session with 
MD during which employees will be afforded 
the opportunity to voice out their concerns, 
offer suggestions or raise matters relevant to 
the Group. Constructive ideas and suggestions 
will be considered for implementation by the 
Management. The dialogue session aims to:
  •  Enhance work cultural alignment and build 
workplace camaraderie;
  •  Encourage open discussion and obtain diverse 
thoughts;
  •  Address employees’ concerns and feedbacks;
  •  Build greater transparency and connection 
leveraging the MD’s personal involvement  
and interaction; and
  •  Improve workplace dynamics, drive motivation 
and performance.
   The Group also has in place an Employee Support 
Hotline that provides confidential support and 
assistance for employees’ work-related issues. 
This Employee Support Hotline also acts as a 
touch-point for employee welfare and benefits 
related enquiries. A total of 83 reports were made 
via the Employee Support Hotline in FYE2023 
falling into the broad categories below: 
  •  Employee benefits : 45 reports
  •  Work-related grievances : 1 report
  •  COVID-19 matters : 27 reports
  •  General enquiries : 10 reports
   The Group has a structured performance 
evaluation system which consists of target  
setting and annual performance assessments 
involving employees and their superiors.  
The process covers face-to-face interactions to 
establish clear and specific work expectations 
including KPI/target setting, continuous 
feedback, performance and career development 
review.
   Employee Satisfaction Surveys (“ESS”) are 
conducted to gauge of employees’ satisfaction 
level. The FYE2023 ESS involved 2,708 employees 
which accounts for 94% of the Group’s total 
workforce. Survey results showed an engagement 
score of 81 points, indicating that 8 out of 10 
employees were consistently engaged. The survey 
results and findings was shared with all Division 
and Group Heads, who subsequently developed 
and implemented post-survey action plans at 
their respective business unit level. For the FYE2024 
survey, the Management aims to increase the 
engagement score to 85 points.
   We recognise our employees’ exemplary 
performance and contributions. Service excellence 
and employee loyalty are acknowledged annually 
through various awards such as Excellent Staff  
Awards, Meritorious Service Awards, Excellent 
Customer Service Awards and Long Service 
Awards. The Group will continue to review our 
compensation and benefits policies to ensure 
competitiveness whilst also recognising our 
employees’ contributions and dedication.

 CoNTrIBUTING To CoMMUNITIES
As we focus on value generation and achieving economic objectives, the Group has not forgotten the significance 
of caring for our local communities in particular the less fortunate and vulnerable. We place great importance to  
take care of the local communities, their well-being and supporting those in need – amply demonstrated by the  
support extended by the Group across the COVID-19 pandemic.
We take great pride in giving back to the community and have made a total of RM1.28 million in community investment 
during FYE2023. Given that our customers come from the community, contributing back to the community 
reciprocates their loyalty and support. Community contributions brings to life the Group’s corporate conscience  
and realises our duty for societal care. The material sustainability matter under Contributing to Communities pillar is 
Strategic Community Investment as listed below:

(ii) Education
  The Group appreciates the importance of education 
on the future of students and how education shapes 
students into productive members of society who 
can collectively contribute to the nation’s growth and 
progress. In support of deserving students in need,  
the Group has in place a formal programme to 
award scholarships to deserving students at three 
(3) public universities namely, Universiti Malaya,  
Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti Putra 
Malaysia. To date, a total of 36 students have 
been awarded education scholarships and  
12 students have graduated with honours.
  Another education-based contribution which explicitly 
reflects the Group’s commitment is our MAF AEON 
Smart Classroom Project. 
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
  This Project with a total investment of  
RM1 million is aimed at providing quality education 
through the restoration and  upgrading existing 
classroom infrastructure in schools. It also represents 
an extension of MAF’s ‘AEON Sayap Bagimu’ 
programme which was first launched in September 
2021 that benefitted 4,150 secondary students 
nationwide. This sustainable community initiative 
aims to enhance digital learning in schools across 
the country and to help bridge the education gap 
for students from low-income families by providing 
equal learning opportunities and with a commitment 
to strengthen their readiness in realising the aspiration  
of developing Malaysia as a digital nation.
   Through the ‘AEON Smart Classroom Project’, 
students will have the necessary support to  
succeed in their studies through smart classroom 
facilities. The smart classrooms will be equipped with

with the aim to close the digital literacy gap.
  The Group also expended RM15,812 in conducting 
road safety advocacy programmes in FYE2023.

The Group recognises our duty as a good corporate citizen also extends to environmental care and protection and 
contributing to its preservation for future generations. In solidarity with the global community, we are committed 
towards instituting climate action to battle the existential threat posed by global warming. 
We are conscientiously doing our part to reduce our carbon footprint and lend to the collective global efforts in 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The continued prosperity of our business hinges on the survival and well-being 
of the planet making it imperative on us pull our weight and work as hard as everyone else across the globe to  
head off global warming. Our material sustainability matter under Environmental Stewardship pillar is Environmental 
Management, as listed below:
(i)  Environmental Conservation
  In FYE2023, reforestation and maintenance of past 
reforestation activities were put on hold as the 
Group worked on redefining focus areas in line 
with the development of our 3-Year Sustainability  
Roadmap and its associated sustainability initiatives.
   The reforestation activities will be reinitiated 
in FYE2024 to rehabilitate Kinta Nature Park,  
a conservatory area for migratory birds and also a 
former tin mining area. In addition, the mangrove 
planting projects to rehabilitate the coastal  
area in Kota Belud, Sabah will also be continued 
under the 3-Year Sustainability Roadmap for coastline 
preservation activities.
(ii) Environmental Management System
  The Group is certified under the ISO 14001:2015 
Environmental Management Systems (“EMS”) 
standard, covering the Group’s processes and 
practices aimed at reducing environmental 
impact from business operation. This certification 
governs the collecting, recycling and disposal 
of waste appropriately by licenced vendors with  
notification submitted to the Department of 
Environment. Our ISO 14001:2015 EMS was 
successfully recertified by an independent third party 
certification body in FYE2023.
  The Group promotes environmentally conscious  
and conscientious behaviour in supporting our 
commitment to minimise our impact on the 
environment, one of the ways we do that is through 
the conduct of campaigns. The following campaigns 
were carried out in FYE2023:
 •  Waste Recycling Drive for the Central Region at 
Head Office Bangsar South – this programme, 
held in conjunction with the International 
E-Waste Day was a collaborative effort with 
T-Pot Electrical and Electronics Sdn. Bhd.  
A total of 70.1kg of e-waste ranging from  
used mobile phones, PCs, printers and  
monitors was collected. The e-waste recycling 
partner is certified by the Department of  
Environment; 
 •  AEON Credit Nationwide Coastal Clean-up  
Programme – this programme, held in conjunction 
with the World Ocean Day 2022 aims to ensure 
that our coastal area is clean from rubbish to 
promote a cleaner ocean. 400 volunteers from 
the Group, students from Yayasan Sukarelawan 
Siswa and local authorities managed to remove 
3.6 tonnes of recyclable waste and 1.1 tonnes 
of non-recyclable waste from six (6) coastal  
areas nationwide;

 •  MAF’s AEON Bersamamu Community Recycling 
Programme – this was held in three local housing 
areas with the aim of creating awareness on 
the need to separate and recycle household 
waste for a cleaner and greener environment.  
During the programme, a Community Recycling 
Buy-Back Counter was set-up with our 
programme partner, Alam Flora Environmental 
Solutions Sdn. Bhd., who managed to collect a 
total of 466.5kg of recyclable waste consisting 
of used cooking oils, old newspapers, aluminium 
cans, plastics and electrical appliances; and
 •  CSR activities organised at the regional 
level, where the Group’s volunteers worked  
hand-in-hand with local authorities to  
remove rubbish from public park areas. Recylable 
and non-recyclable components of the rubbish 
collected was separated for proper disposal by the 
local authorities.

(iii) responsible consumption
  Environmental and planetary care is embedded 
into the Group’s corporate consciousness.  
We practice responsible consumption as a 
matter of course, to us, this is “business as usual”.  
In helping the planet, we also help ourselves as 
responsible consumption leads directly to cost  
savings. The Group measures our consumption in 
electricity and water consumption.

Electricity
2.28 mil kWh
Water
21,154m3
FYE2022
Electricity
2.62 mil kWh
Water

  The data above covers only regional offices and does  
not include branches. Significant consumption  
increases were noted for water due to the 
resumption and ramp-up of business activities 
following the abatement of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   In addition to the abovementioned campaigns, 
the Group also issues regular communications 
to instil environmental awareness and build  
an appreciation for the importance of 
environmental care and protection through  
social media and internal communication  
channels. The communications issued in  
FYE2023 are listed below:

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

---- Page 83 ----
The Board of Directors (“the Board”) of AEON Credit 
Service (M) Berhad (“AEON Credit” or “the Company”) 
believes that good corporate governance (“CG”) is 
fundamental to ensuring that AEON Credit Service (M) 
Berhad and its subsidiaries’ (“the Group”) business is well 
managed, resilient and operationally efficient so as to be 
able to continue generating value for our stakeholders. 
Good CG practices underpin our risk-managed approach 
to conducting business and ensuring that risks arising 
are appropriately mitigated and balanced against their 
expected returns. Additionally, they also enhance the 
Group’s accountability to stakeholders, promote greater 
transparency and protect our good name and reputation. 
These collectively earn and reinforce investors’ trust and 
improves access to capital.
The two (2) major developments articulated below will 
assert significant influence on our CG focus and approach 
moving forward to align with current developments and 
market expectations: 
The COVID-19 pandemic has left an 
indelible impact on the way enterprises 
do business. One of the most enduring 
and visible impact of the pandemic, 
which continues into the present 
endemic phase, has been the rise of contactless 
transacting, either online or cashless. This dovetails 
perfectly with our Digital Transformation journey.  
As we progress on this journey, we have also  
continually strengthened our cyber security  
capabilities as well as our infrastructure and  
processes to protect our systems and to secure 
customer data privacy and confidentiality.
Calls for broader and deeper adoption 
of ESG from the Government, regulators 
and stakeholders, have intensified in 
recent years. Giving back to society 
has always been part of our business 
philosophy, as evidenced by our humanitarian efforts 
during the peak of the pandemic. In addition as part 
of our financial inclusion efforts, AEON Credit has 
a collaboration with the Ministry of Entrepreneur 
Development and Cooperatives (“MEDAC”) together 
with IN2NIAGA, a mobile payment platform solutions 
provider and Social Security Organisation (“SOCSO”)  
to assist hawkers and petty traders in embracing 
digitalisation. Critically, this initiative will serve to 
ensure they keep relevant with capabilities to accept 
cashless payments while being afforded social  
security protection. On the environmental front,  
in addition to on-going environmental conservation 
activities, AEON Credit has also completed the 
development of our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emission 
profile for both FYE2023 and FYE2022 which will  
lend to our carbon management efforts.
As a financial services provider, AEON Credit is subject to 
a comprehensive regulatory regime which manifests in 
stringent oversight and supervision. The Board is committed 
to full and complete compliance to the requirements of 
our regulators and has, accordingly, established a robust 
framework for good CG to guide our CG and compliance 
practices. Good governance is imperative to ensure 
sustainable long-term performance, maximise returns 
for our stakeholders and to create long-term economic 
value and growth of the Group. As such, the framework 
is updated regularly to reflect any new and amendments  
to regulatory requirements.
The Group was conferred the ASEAN Asset Class Award 
at the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (“ACGS”)  
Awards in 2022, bearing testimony to our strong CG 
orientation and practices across business strategies 
and operations. The ACGS is jointly developed by Asian 
Development Bank and the ASEAN Capital Markets  
Forum and supported by domestic ranking bodies, 
including Minority Shareholders Watch Group.
This Corporate Governance Overview Statement  
(“CG Overview Statement”) is made pursuant to  
Paragraph 15.25(1) of the Main Market Listing  
Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa Malaysia Securities  
Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) and in accordance with the 
Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”). 
Guidance was also drawn from Practice Note 9 of 
Bursa Securities’ MMLR and the Corporate Governance 
Guide (4th Edition) issued by Bursa Securities.  
This CG overview Statement should be read together 
with the Corporate Governance Report (“CG Report”),  
which is available on https://www.aeoncredit.com.my/
aeon-corporate/corporate-governance or scan the 
QR Code below, as the CG Report provides a detailed 
articulation on the application of the Company’s corporate 
governance practices vis-a-vis the MCCG.
This statement sets out a summary of the Group’s CG 
practices during the financial year ended 28 February  
2023 (“FYE2023”) and is intended to provide shareholders 
and various stakeholders with an overview of how the 
Group has applied the three (3) Key Principles of the  
MCCG during the FYE2023:
(i) Principle A: Board Leadership and Effectiveness;
(ii) Principle B: Effective Audit and Risk Management; and
(iii)  Principle C: Integrity in Corporate Reporting and 
Meaningful Relationship with Stakeholders.

The primary role of the Board is to protect and enhance 
long-term shareholder value. The Board sets overall 
strategies for the Group and supervises the Management 
in the execution of those strategies. The Board also  
ensures that good CG policies and practices are 
implemented within the Group and that regulations and 
guidelines which the Group is subject to are fully and  
diligently complied with. The Board believes that tight 
alignment of business strategies to good CG practices 
is foundational to the successful implementation of the 
Group’s strategies. In support of this, an effective and 
strong system of risk management and internal controls 
have been put in place to ensure that risks are appropriately 
identified, evaluated, managed and mitigated.
In the course of discharging its duties, the Board acts

interests of the Group and its shareholders. Generally,  
the principal roles and responsibilities of the Board 
encompass the following:

and other corporate initiatives that have a material

corporate culture within the Group which reinforces 
integrity, ethical and professional behaviour;
(iv)  Promote sustainability through appropriate Environment, 
Social and Governance considerations in the Group’s 
business strategies;
(v)  Oversee and approve the recovery, resolution and 
business continuity plans for the Group to continually 
fortify its financial strength, maintain and preserve 
critical operations and services when it comes under 
stress; 
(vi)  Promote timely and effective communications 
between the Group and shareholders/regulators on 
matters affecting or that may affect the safety and 
soundness of the Group;
(vii)  Oversee and monitor Digital Transformation initiatives 
and attendant material technology investments to 
ensure targeted capabilities and benefits are realised; 
and 
(viii)  Oversee the progress of the establishment of ACS 
Digital Berhad on a regular basis.
In discharging its roles and responsibilities, the Board 
is guided by a Board Charter, which sets out its roles, 
responsibilities and powers as well as the matters that  
the Board may delegate to the Board Committees and the 
Management. The Board Charter and Terms of Reference 
(“TOR”) are subject to periodic review to conform to the 
following requirements, statutory provisions, guidelines, 
principles and best practices:
(i) MMLR of Bursa Securities;
(ii) Bank Negara Malaysia Policy Documents;
(iii) Companies Act 2016;
(iv) MCCG;
(v)  Bursa Malaysia’s Corporate Governance Guide  
(4th Edition); and

exercise which requires approval of shareholders;

the ordinary course of business;

threshold under Top Management approval;

•  Appointment of new Directors, including setting the 
relevant terms of service and level of remuneration, 
subject to approval of shareholders where necessary;
•  Ensuring regulatory compliance; and
•  Declaration of dividends, subject to approval of 
shareholders where necessary.
The Board delegates responsibility for the day-to-day 
operations of the business to the Managing Director 
(“MD”) who is assisted by a Top Management of functional 
experts (collectively “the Management”) recognising 
their responsibilities to ensure that the Group operates 
within a framework of prudent and effective controls.  
The Management, in turn, exercises oversight and 
governance over execution and provides the Board 
and the respective Board Committees with the requisite 
information and specialist advice in a timely manner 
to enable the Directors to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities effectively and yield expected results.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and MD 
are distinct and have been clearly segregated to further  
enhance and preserve a balance of authority and 
accountability, to avoid unfettered powers of decision 
making. The Chairman, who is not a member of the 
Audit Committee (“AC”), Board Risk Committee (“BRC”), 
Nominating Committee (“NC”) or Remuneration 
Committee (“RC”) is primarily responsible for the orderly 
conduct of the Board meetings and ensures effectiveness 
of the Board and manages the interface between the 
Board and Management. In addition, the Chairman has 
responsibility for ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Board’s governance processes and leads the  
Board in oversight of proper conduct and management  
of the affairs of the Group.
The MD ensures effective implementation of the Group’s 
strategic plans, policies and decisions approved by 
the Board. The MD is also responsible for leading and  
managing the overall operations and making business 
decisions for the Group, with the support of the  
Top Management, within mandates and limits of 
authorities delegated by the Board. Various powers are 
further delegated to the Management team based on 
the Group’s Authority Matrix, which is also subject to  
periodic review based on changes in the organisation 
structure and business requirements for efficient and 
effective decision making.
BoArD MEETINGS AND ACCESS To INForMATIoN
Board meetings are pre-scheduled to take place on a 
monthly basis to enable the Board to stay current on 
emerging areas of interest or concern, facilitate close 
and regular follow-up of on-going matters and to 
accommodate expeditious decision making. 
Board and Board Committee meetings are formal forums 
for deliberation of matters of strategic and operational 
significance. Ahead of any such meetings a formal and 
structured agenda and related information are provided to 
all Directors at least 5 business days in advance to allow 
time for review, assimilation and if required, obtain further 
information on matters to be deliberated. Occasionally, 
the Board or Board Committees meetings may be called 
at short notice when critical decisions are required on an 
urgent basis. 
Attendance of Management member(s) will be called for, 
as necessary, to articulate more detailed information and 
provide specialist perspectives to facilitate and support 
the Board or Board Committees in making informed  
decisions. Where specialist input or advice is required for 
the Board to arrive at a well-considered and informed 
decision, the Board may seek the counsel of independent 
subject matter expert(s), if needed, at the Group’s expense 
in accordance with established procedures set out in the 
Board Charter.
Board members have unrestricted access to the advice 
and services of the appointed qualified Company 
Secretary, who is a member of the Malaysian Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The Company 
Secretary is equipped with the skills and expertise 
to provide well-informed observations and effective 
support to Directors to ensure that Board procedures 
and relevant regulatory requirements and guidelines,  
including those in relation to CG, are adhered to.
Besides making arrangements for Board, Board Committees 
and general meetings and drawing up the relevant  
meeting agenda, the Company Secretary also has 
an advisory capacity in monitoring and advising on 
developments in the CG domain. The Company Secretary 
also assists the Board in applying best practices to meet 
the Board’s needs and stakeholders’ expectations.  
In addition, the Board is also alerted to and advised by 
the Management on any material change(s) in regulatory 
and compliance requirements, including their associated 
implications and impact on the Board and Group.  
As part of the regular reporting regime, the Management 
also provides on-going regulatory compliance updates  
to the Board.
During FYE2023, the Board met fourteen (14) times.  
The matters below were reviewed and deliberated at  
each Board meeting:
(i)  Group business and financial performance and 
business plan and budget;
(ii)  Governance, risk management and mitigation and 
compliance in relation to the Group;
(iii)  Sustainability matters associated initiatives and 
progress; and
(iv) Major investments and related matters.

In addition to the aforementioned Board meetings,  
a Directors Offsite Retreat was held in February 2023  
which saw the Board participating in a strategy formulation 
session for the Group, together with Top Management

Insurance Brokers (M) Sdn Bhd.
All proceedings of Board meetings are minuted and 
circulated to Board members in advance of the next 
Board meeting including updates on the follow-up  
action items. Where necessary, decisions of the Board 
are also made by way of circular resolutions in between 
scheduled Board meetings.
During Board meetings, the Chairman of AC, BRC, NC and 
RC will brief the Board on their respective Committees’ 
salient matters, recommendations, significant issues,  
risk matters and findings which require the Board’s 
attention, approval and direction.

The Board is committed to ensuring that members 
collectively possess the diversity of skills, knowledge 
and experience pivotal to driving the Group forward.  
This commitment also extends to embracing inclusiveness  
in Board appointments. The Board believes diversity 
adds value to deliberations and makes for a balanced 
view leveraging on different perspectives and backed the 
members’ collective wealth of experience. To this end,  
the Board considers diversity from a number of different 
aspects, including skills, background, knowledge, 
international and industry experience, culture, independence, 
age, ethnicity, gender and any other factors which the 
Board thinks fit. Sourcing the right Board members is a 
continuing priority and is always conducted in accordance 
with the Board’s CG agenda in order to achieve the right 
diversity mix in the Board.
The Board currently consists of ten (10) members, 
comprising the Chairman who is a Non-Independent 
Non-Executive Director, six (6) Independent Directors, 
one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and  
two (2) Executive Directors, including the MD. 
60% of the Board members are Independent Directors 
strongly reinforcing a commitment to independence -  
this proportion complies with Bank Negara Malaysia 
(“BNM”) CG Policy and is over and above that prescribed 
under the MMLR of Bursa Securities. While in terms of 
gender diversity, 40% of the Board members are female, 
exceeding the regulators’ target of 30% female board 
representation. 
The present size and composition of the Board 
is considered to be optimum and well balanced.  
Board members possess a diverse blend of professional 
experience across a variety of disciplines relevant to the 
Group’s business and operations underscoring their ability 
to effectively contribute to the Group’s continued growth 
and value creation. Further, the diversity inherent within 
the Board supports the Group in facing the challenges 
of an intensely competitive industry environment and 
its constantly evolving risk profile. There is no individual

BoArD EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATIoN
The effectiveness of the Board is critical to impactful and value creating stewardship of the Group and, accordingly,  
the Board conducts a rigorous Board Effectiveness Evaluation (“BEE”) process each year to assess the performance of 
the Board, Board Committees and each individual Board member. The BEE has a principal focus on the performance of 
individual Directors, their respective training and development needs, involvement and contribution of the Directors at 
Board and Board Committees meetings. Once every three years, an independent firm of consultants will be appointed 
to provide insights on the Board’s performance against peer boards and best practices. In line with this principle,  
the NC had during FYE2023 appointed an independent firm of consultants to undertake BEE, and the details are set out  
in the CG Report.
DIrECTorS TrAINING
The Board recognises the importance of continuing education and acknowledges that training is a critical ongoing process 
to ensure that the Directors keep relevant and abreast of the latest developments. Training also equips the Directors with 
the necessary skills and knowledge to guide the Group as it navigates the challenges of a constantly changing environment. 
The Board has delegated the role of reviewing the training and development needs of the Directors to the NC.
A comprehensive induction programme is provided to ease new Directors into their role and assist them in understanding 
the Group’s business, challenges, issues and strategies. All new Directors are also provided with information packs 
containing the Board Charter, Code of Conduct (“CoC”), TOR of Board Committees, previous year’s Integrated Annual 
Report and relevant Board materials to facilitate an understanding of their expected roles.
To further enhance the knowledge of the Directors and enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities more 
effectively, the Group during the year under review engaged professional training providers to conduct in-house and  
also external trainings. The list of training programs attended by members of the Board in FYE2023 is set out below:

The Group has established the following policies to  
ensure the conduct of activities undertaken is carried out 
ethically and with integrity:
(i) Code of Conduct
  The Group’s Code of Conduct (“CoC”) dictates the 
ethical standard of behaviour for all AEON constituents 
(Directors, management and employees), guiding 
their activities, work approach and daily decisions.  
The basic principles take into consideration the 
interests of the Group’s customers, shareholders, 
employees, business partners and the broader 
community to ensure the Group operates its business 
with integrity, transparency and accountability.
  All employees are briefed on the CoC upon 
commencement of employment and attend refresher 
training on an annual basis. Directors, management 
and employees are expected to observe high 
standards of integrity and fair dealing in relation 
to customers, business partners, and regulators. 
The CoC is accessible at the Company’s website at

(ii) Whistle-Blowing Policy
The Group’s Whistle-Blowing Policy (“WBP”) provides  
a transparent mechanism and avenue for all  
stakeholders to report or raise genuine concerns 
anonymously and confidentially on any misconduct 
without fear of retaliation. The WBP sets a clear 
procedural guide for stakeholders to follow in raising 
their concerns to ensure that issues are addressed to 
the appropriate authority and definitive action can be 
taken accordingly if ensuing investigations find the 
concerns valid.

In upholding the above commitment, the Group shall:
 (i)  Adopt zero tolerance of all forms of bribery and

the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act

  The Group strictly does not tolerate any act of 
bribery and corruption and requires all our business 
associates (including its employees, directors, agents, 
representatives and sub-contractors) to be aware and 
adhere to the Group’s policies in relation to bribery 
and corruption. Should there be any act or potential 
of corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest or similar 
unethical acts, all parties must disclose this via the 
appropriate whistle-blowing channels in order to 
discourage bribery of all forms related to the Group’s 
operations.
(iv) Entertainment and Gift Policy
  As an integral part of our continuous effort to 
promote impeccable business ethics, the Group

of the Entertainment and Gift Policy and request  
them to respect the Group’s policy in not purchasing 
and delivering any gift to our employees, at any time, 
for any reason.

(“ABMS”)
  A key action the Group adopts to strengthen 
governance is certification in ISO37001: 2016 ABMS.  
This certification, which has been recertified in  
FYE2023 for an additional three (3) years, validates 
the processes in place within the Group’s ABMS to  
prevent, detect, and address events of bribery.  
The Group strives to ensure all employees act 
professionally and ethically, consistent with our  
CoC in all business dealings. It is also a required 
commitment from our suppliers and agents to  
uphold the highest standard of integrity in their 
dealings with the Group.
  The Group provides regular anti-bribery and  
anti-corruption training for all employees and 
business associates to reinforce the importance of 
integrity and good conduct. On a regular basis our 
employees also undertake assessments to enhance 
their understanding of the Group’s anti-bribery and  
anti-corruption requirements, in particular Section 17A  
of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission  
Act 2009.
  On an annual basis, all employees, business associates 
and suppliers are required to commit to an Anti-Bribery 
Pledge by signing-off on an Integrity Declaration to 
demonstrate their commitment towards creating a 
transparent and fair business environment that is free 
from corruption.

INTErNAL AUDIT FUNCTIoN
The Board has established an in-house internal audit 
function. The primary responsibility of the Internal 
Audit Division is to provide independent and objective 
assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
risk management, internal control, anti-corruption,  
whistle-blowing and governance processes implemented 
by Management.
The Internal Audit Division’s mission, scope of work, 
responsibilities and authority are governed by its 
Internal Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. 
As guided by the Internal Audit Charter, Policy and  
Procedure, the Internal Audit Division maintained 
their independence and impartiality on the activities 
and functions it audits. To reflect the audit objectivity 
and independence of the internal audit function,  
the Internal Audit Division reports functionally to the 
AC and administratively to the Managing Director, 
and has unfettered access to the AC. Through this  
reporting relationship, the AC also ensured that the 
Internal Audit Division has the authority to carry out their 
work objectively and independently. During the year 
under review, the Head of Internal Audit and all internal  
auditors have confirmed to the AC in December 2022 
via the annual declaration that they were free from any 
relationships or conflict of interest which could impair  
their objectivity and independence in their audit 
engagements.
Internal Audit’s scope of coverage encompassed 
all business and support units. In relation to this,  
all auditable areas were risk ranked using risk-based 
audit planning methodology to prioritise the audit work 
and to scope the audits on high risk auditable areas.  
These were guided and defined in the Annual Audit 
Plan for the financial year ended 28 February 2023,  
which was approved by the AC in December 2021.

noted from these audits were highlighted to the  
appropriate level of Management for action plans in 
addressing control gaps identified. Root cause of issues 
noted was assessed to enable relevant recommendations 
and ensure remedial measures are taken to address the 
audit issues. Internal Audit Division also tabled the audit 
issues, root cause and remedial action plans thereto,  
as well as the progress of remedial actions taken on 
open audit issues, at the monthly Internal Audit Meetings 
attended by the Managing Director, Executive Director and 
Executive Officers of the Group for review and deliberation.

INTroDUCTIoN
In line with Paragraph 15.26(b) of Bursa Malaysia  
Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) Main Market 
Listing Requirements (“MMLR”), the Board of Directors  
(the “Board”) of a listed issuer is required to include 
in its Integrated Annual Report a Statement on Risk  
Management and Internal Control. This statement 
which outlines the nature and the key features of risk 
management and internal control systems within  
AEON Credit Service (M) Berhad and its subsidiary  
(“the Group”) for the Financial Year Ended 28 February 
2023 (“FYE2023”), has been prepared in accordance to:
a)  Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control 
– Guidelines for Directors of Public Listed Issuers  
which was endorsed by Bursa Securities; and
b)  Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”) 
issued by Securities Commission Malaysia.
Board responsibilities
The Board affirms its commitment and overall responsibility 
to review and approve the Group’s overall risk strategy, 
including risk appetite, risk tolerance and overseeing its 
implementation to support the sustainability initiatives 
of the Group. The Board has always placed significant 
emphasis on the presence of sound risk management 
and internal control systems that are necessary in 
safeguarding the Group’s assets and shareholders’ interest,  
as well as to ensure compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations. In light of the above, the Board ensures 
that there are proper risk management processes in 
place to identify, evaluate, review and manage significant 
or emerging risks that could derail the Group’s aim in  
meeting its objectives.
The Board recognises that the risk management and 
internal control systems are designed to manage and 
mitigate, rather than to eliminate the risk of failure in the 
achievement of goals and corporate objectives of the 
Group. The system can therefore only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against the occurrence of 
material misstatement, fraud or loss, and that the risk 
management processes are designed to minimise or 
mitigate it.
In acknowledging that having sound risk management 
and internal control systems are crucial, the Group has 
a governance structure in place that ensures effective 
oversight of risks and internal controls in the Group.  
For this, the Board is assisted by the Audit Committee 
(“AC”) and Board Risk Committee (“BRC”) to provide 
primary effective oversight responsibilities on the 
Group’s risk management and internal control activities.  
The Board remains responsible for the governance of  
the risk and internal controls with regard to the execution 
of the delegated oversight responsibilities.
For the FYE2023, six (6) BRC meetings were conducted 
with the purpose of overseeing the Group’s risk and 
compliance particularly on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of risk management and compliance processes.  
The BRC sets the strategic direction for the risk roles, 
responsibilities and reporting structures. Periodic reporting 
on the risk management activities undertaken by the 
Management are reported by the BRC to the Board.  
The BRC is also responsible to review the Group’s 
sustainability related matters, including Sustainability 
Framework, material matters covering Environment,  
Social and Governance (“ESG”) risks, and sustainability 
reporting. For more details on the function of the BRC, 
please refer to BRC Report on pages 100 to 101.
Management responsibilities
The Management’s overall responsibility is to assist 
the Board in implementing the Group’s frameworks,  
policies and procedures on risk and control by:
•  Formulating and reviewing relevant frameworks, 
policies and procedures to manage risks in accordance 
to the Group’s strategic goals.
•  Identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting 
risks and internal control, as well as taking proper 
actions. In identifying and mitigating or minimising 
the risks, it is relevant to the business of the Group  
to ensure the achievement of its objectives and goals.
•  Implementing remedial action to address deficiencies 
that were being identified and tracked for closure. 
Thereafter, to report to the Board for deliberation.
•  Reviewing the changes in the market environment, 
be it economic, environmental, political or social,  
on any emerging risks that can affect the Group and 
its businesses.
•  Reporting in timely manner to the Board on 
any changes in risks or emerging risks and the 
corresponding corrective actions taken.
The Management has further assured the Board that the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems 
are operating adequately and effectively in all material  
aspects with the necessary processes being implemented.

risk management practices through integration of ERMF 
with business practices for better decision making and 
ultimately enhance business performance to preserve the 
Group’s long-term value.
The key features of the ERMF include:
Risk Appetite
It is defined as the amount and types of risk that the Group  
is willing to accept, in pursuit of its business objectives.
The Group’s risk appetite is an integral component 
of the Group’s robust risk management framework.  
The risk appetite also provides a structure in understanding 
risk and is embedded in the day-to-day business activities.
Risk Governance and Oversight
Risk governance provides a formalised and transparent 
structure that promotes involvement from the Board and 
Management in the risk management processes to ensure 
a uniform view of risk across the Group.
The three lines of defence address specific duties and 
responsibilities related to risk and control functions 
coordinated within the Group:
•	 1st	Line	of	Defence	–	Risk	Taking
  The first lines of defence shall be managed by Business 
Units (“BU”) who has day-to-day ownership and 
management over risks and controls.
•	 2nd Line	of	Defence	–	Risk	Controlling
  The second line of defence supports senior 
management to monitor and review the first line 
of defence to ensure risks and controls are properly 
managed. Essentially, this is a management and 
oversight function that owns aspects of the risk 
management and compliance processes. 
•	 3rd	Line	of	Defence	–	Assurance	Party
  The third line of defence provides assurance to  
senior management and the Board that the first 
and second lines efforts are consistent and meet 
expectations. This assurance function is performed by 
Internal Audit Division.
In providing effective oversight function, BRC is assisted 
by the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) to review 
the effectiveness of risk management, compliance, legal, 
sustainability and other governance related matters.  
The RMC comprises the key management team of the 
Group, which include the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) 
as Chairman and Group/Business Unit Heads as RMC 
members. The RMC meetings, coordinated by the Risk 
Management Department are held on a monthly basis, 
to address risk, compliance and other related matters 
together with mitigating measures, reviewing policies 
and procedures and deliberating emerging issues that  
possibly impact the Group. Any new or amended 
frameworks and policies related to risk, compliance 
and other related matters are reviewed by the RMC, 
recommended by the BRC and subsequently approved  
by the Board. 
During the financial year, the Group has established 
a Framework of Technology Risk Management and 
Cyber Resilience (“TRMCR”) which came into effect in 
September 2022. The framework is to guide and manage 
technology risks in a systematic and consistent manner 
to safeguard the Group’s information infrastructure, 
systems, data and cyber resilience, thus placing additional 
emphasis on cybersecurity to address the trend of 
increasing cyber threats. The framework is also aligned 
with the requirements in BNM policy document on  
Risk Management in Technology (“RMiT”). The Group 
has also appointed a Chief Information Security Officer  
(“CISO”) who is responsible in ensuring the TRMCR 
framework is updated in line with regulatory requirements 
and reviewed annually.
In FYE2023, the Group’s Compliance Section has reviewed 
and revised the Policy of Anti-Money Laundering, 
Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial 
Sanctions (“AML/CFT and TFS”). The focus of the revision 
was mainly on the definition of Politically Exposed  
Person (PEP) and clauses related to PEP, internal audit 
function and re-screening of employees. The revision 
is to ensure that the Group’s internal policy and current 
practices are aligned with the regulatory requirements  
in the BNM policy document on AML/CFT and TFS.

Furthermore, the Group has obtained recertification 
on ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System 
(“ABMS”) as a result of the course of audit conducted 
by the appointed external auditor, SIRIM, in February 
2023. The recertification is evident that the Group has 
reviewed the ABMS performance to ensure continuing 
suitability, adequacy, effectiveness and alignment 
with the strategic direction of the Group. Other 
than ABMS, the Group has also acquired Integrated 
Management System (“IMS”) which is a combination of 
ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System (“QMS”),  
ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Management System 
(“ISMS”) and ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management 
System (“EMS”). 
In ensuring the Board and Management’s roles and 
responsibilities are adequately discharged, the Group 
has various Management committees and meetings in 
place to assist and support the Board. Generally, there 
are two (2) meeting categories which are the Board Level  
Meeting and Company Level Meeting. The Board Level 
Meeting is supported by four (4) committees whereas 
the Company Level Meeting is supported by twelve (12) 
committees. The committees have specific roles and 
mandates to provide comprehensive oversight and  
control functions within the Group.
The Group has been identified as a significant subsidiary 
of the holding corporation, AEON Financial Service 
Co.,Ltd. (“AFS”) Japan. As a significant subsidiary, 
the Group is required to comply with the AFS’s 
Framework of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
(“Japanese Sarbanes-Oxley or J-SOX”). Pursuant to this,  
the Management through Internal Audit Division, regularly 
conducts evaluation of internal controls in the Group 
to identify any significant impact on internal controls 
and financial reporting. In addition, on an annual basis,  
the Group has engaged Messrs. Deloitte PLT to assess  
the effectiveness of existing internal controls and  
financial reporting.
risk and Compliance Culture
Risk Management Department and Compliance Section 
continuously seek to build a strong risk management and 
compliance culture by promoting awareness, ownership 
and accountability. Training, e-learning and awareness 
are being emphasised in order to promote the risk and 
compliance culture. The risk and compliance related 
frameworks, policies and procedures are reviewed 
on a periodic basis to meet changes in the business 
environment, as well as the requirements of applicable 
laws and regulations. 
As part of the risk and compliance culture, the Group 
has instilled a culture where the Board, management 
and all employees of the Group are committed to 
adhere to the requirement of relevant laws and  
regulations. This commitment is clearly demonstrated 
through the enhancement and strengthening of the 
Group’s policies, processes and controls in managing  
and preventing non-compliance.
risk Management Process
a) Risk Identification
  It is a process of identifying, understanding and 
assessing inherent risk for relevant products,  
new products or processes and business initiatives.  
It enables early detection of risk and ensures sound 
risk management practices are in place.
b)	 Risk	Evaluation	and	Treatment
  A combination of qualitative and quantitative 
methods are used by the Management to assess and 
evaluate the risk identified from two perspectives –  
risk likelihood and impact parameters. Management 
will then decide, in consultation with RMC on  
the risk treatment options for subsequent 
implementation. Treatment options are being 
monitored and tracked till closure in order to mitigate 
the identified risk effectively from future occurrence.
c) Risk Monitoring and Reporting
  Monitoring of early warning and key indicators are 
crucial in alerting the management on any potential 
risk events, and to put in place timely action to  
mitigate the potential risk. The results are then 
being reported and communicated at the respective 
platform.
d)	 Communication
  The Group, through the RMC, continuously 
communicates and engages with stakeholders to 
identify possible risks in addition to the events and 
circumstances that could affect the achievement 
of the objectives which includes the realisation of  
the opportunities. 
Internal Control Systems
The Board is responsible for managing the key business 
risks of the Group and implementing an appropriate 
internal control systems to manage those risks.  
The AC, assisted by the Internal Audit Division, provides 
the Board with the assurance it requires on the 
adequacy and integrity of the system of internal controls.  
The AC has an oversight function of all activities carried 
out by the Internal Audit Division.

areas, which encompassed auditing the Group’s business 
and support functions, information systems, IT operations 
& security, J-SOX assessment and outsourced service 
providers. These are guided by an annual internal audit 
plan, which is approved by the AC and internal audit  
reports are tabled at the AC Meetings for review and 
deliberation. Where applicable, the Internal Audit Division 
provides recommendations to improve the management 
of risks, control, anti-corruption, whistle-blowing 
and governance processes. The AC regularly reviews 
the status of rectification actions on the findings or  
recommendations by the Internal Audit Division.
Assessment of risk Management and Internal Control 
Systems
The Board is satisfied with the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems. The Board has received 
assurance from the Managing Director and the Chief 
Financial Officer who represent the Management 
Team of Group that the Group’s risk management 
and internal control systems, in all material aspects,  
are operating adequately and effectively. For the  
financial year under review, there were no material  
control failures or adverse compliance events that have 
directly resulted in any material loss to the Group.
review of Statement by External Auditors
According to Paragraph 15.23 of the MMLR,  
this Statement has been reviewed by the external auditors 
for the FYE2023. The limited assurance was conducted 
in accordance with the Audit Assurance Practice  
Guide 3 (“AAPG3”), which was issued by the Malaysian 
Institute of Accountants (“MIA”), and it does not 
require the external auditors to form an opinion on the  
effectiveness and adequacy of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems. Based on the  
procedures performed, the external auditors have  
reported to the Board that nothing has come to their 
attention that had caused them to believe that this 
Statement is not prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the disclosures required by the  
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: 
Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, nor is factually 
inaccurate.
To ensure that sound system of controls is in place,  
the Group has upheld primary processes in reviewing the 
adequacy and integrity of the system of internal controls. 
The primary processes include:
•  An annual business plan and budget which are 
submitted to the Board for approval. Actual 
performances are reviewed against the targeted 
results on a monthly basis for Management responses 
and actions, where applicable. Board reviews 
monthly reports from the management on the 
key operating statistics, and feedback on actions  
required are furnished to the senior management 
team.
•  The Group’s core values and Code of Conduct are 
the essential guiding principles which are observed 
in all business dealings and sets out standards of  
good practice to be observed by all staff.
•  The corporate decision authority matrix, corporate 
purchasing authority matrix and respective business 
units’ authority matrix with defined empowerment 
and authority serves as a framework in regulating all 
business activities and decisions within the Group.
•  The Group has in place written operating procedures 
in various areas of operations, which also incorporate 
risk management issues and updated as and when 
necessary to improve on the control environment  
and operational efficiency.
All the abovementioned processes are in place with the 
aim to provide reasonable assurance as to the accuracy 
of financial information, non-financial disclosures,  
the Group’s compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations, and the effectiveness of the internal control 
systems. The Board will conduct reviews on a continuous 
basis to ensure the effectiveness, adequacy and integrity 
of the system of internal controls in safeguarding  
the Group’s assets and stakeholders’ interests. 
Internal Audit Function
The Group has an adequately resourced in-house internal 
audit function. The primary responsibility of the Internal 
Audit Division is to provide independent and objective 
assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
risk management, internal control, anti-corruption,  
whistle-blowing and governance processes implemented 
by Management. The Internal Audit Division adopts a  
risk-based audit planning methodology to plan and  
prioritise the audit work focusing on high risk auditable

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance 
for doubtful debts, and had satisfied that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had 
been made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including the 
value of current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down 
to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company misleading; or
(iii) which have arisen which would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the 
Group and the of Company misleading or inappropriate; or
(iv) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would 
render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

(i) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which 
secures the liability of any other person; or
(ii) any contingent liability of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.
No contingent or other liability has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve 
months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the  
Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors:
(i) the results of the Group’s and of the Company’s operations during the financial year were not substantially affected 
by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and
(ii) there has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report, any item, 
transaction or event of a material and unusual nature which is likely to affect substantially the results of the Group’s 
and of the Company’s operations for the financial year in which this report is made.

Report on the Audit of Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of AEON CREDIT SERVICE (M) BERHAD, which comprise the statements of 
financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 28 February 2023, and the statements of profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company 
for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies,  
as set out on pages 117 to 184.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group 
and of the Company as at 28 February 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then 
ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards 
on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the  
Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities 
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, 
Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for 
Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) 
(“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context 
of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter Our Audit Performed and Responses Thereon
Impairment of financing receivables
As at 28 February 2023, financing receivables  
stand at RM10,048,613,000 (2022: RM9,101,111,000) 
representing 90.4% (2022: 89.7%) of total assets of 
the Group and of the Company. MFRS 9 requires 
such financing receivables to be measured using 
expected credit losses (ECL) model. 
The measurement of ECL is complex and requires 
the application of significant judgement which 
includes the identification of credit exposures 
with significant deterioration in credit quality, 
assumptions used in the ECL models such as the 
expected future cash flows, time value of money, 
forward-looking macroeconomic factors and 
probability-weighted multiple scenarios. 
Refer to the significant accounting policy in Note 
3 to the financial statements, the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty in Note 4 to the 
financial statements, the disclosure of financing 
receivables in Note 11 to the financial statements.
Our audit procedures included, among others: 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of key controls over 
impairment of financing receivables, including the governance 
over the ECL methodology and model development. 
With the involvement of financial risk specialists, we have:
•	 assessed	 whether	the	Group’s	and	the	Company’s	ECL	model	
on financing receivables is in accordance with MFRS 9.  
The assessment includes assessment of significant 
assumptions and considerations applied by the Group and 
the Company in the ECL model to address the requirements 
of MFRS 9 such as criteria for significant deterioration 
in credit quality, time value of money, forward-looking 
macroeconomic factors and probability-weighted multiple 
scenarios;
•	 recomputed	 the	 Group’s	 and	 the	 Company’s	 impairment	
based on the ECL model and compared against the 
impairment of financing receivables recorded by the Group 
and the Company; 
•	 assessed	 the	reasonableness	and	tested	the	identification	and	
calculation of the overlay adjustments to the ECL; and
•	 verified	 the	inputs	into	the	ECL	model	developed	to	ensure	
accuracy and completeness. 
We involved our IT specialists in the performance of these 
procedures where their specific expertise was required.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and  
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis 
of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, 
we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•	 Identify	 and	assess	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	of	the	Company,	
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
•	 Obtain	 an	understanding	of	internal	control	relevant	to	the	audit	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s internal control. 
•	 Evaluate	 the	appropriateness	of	accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	accounting	estimates	and	
related disclosures made by the Directors.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
•	 Conclude	 on	the	appropriateness	of	the	Directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	and,	based	on	
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group and the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
•	 Evaluate	 the	overall	presentation,	structure	and	content	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	of	the	Company,	
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events  
in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
•	 Obtain	 sufficient	appropriate	audit	evidence	regarding	the	financial	information	of	the	entities	or	business	activities	
within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit 
matter. We describe the matter in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of 
this report.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
unless otherwise stated in the significant accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the  
fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or 
estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group and the 
Company take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability on the same basis market participants would 
take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for 
measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for any 
share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of MFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions 
that are within the scope of MFRS 16 Leases and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not 
fair value, such value-in-use in MFRS 136 Impairment of Assets.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on 
the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to 
the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
•	 Level	 1	inputs	are	quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities	that	the	entity	 
can assess at the measurement date;
•	 Level	 2	are	inputs,	other	than	quoted	prices	included	within	Level	1,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability,	
either directly or indirectly; and
•	 Level	3	are	unobservable	inputs	for	the	asset	or	liability.
The principal accounting policies are set out below:
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary. 
Control is achieved when the Company:
•	 has	the	power	over	the	investee;
•	 is	exposed,	or	has	rights,	to	variable	returns	from	its	involvement	with	the	investee;	and
•	 has	the	ability	to	use	its	power	to	affect	its	returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over 
the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the 
Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:
•	 the	 size	of	the	Company’s	holding	of	voting	rights	relative	to	the	size	and	dispersion	of	holdings	of	the	other	
vote holders;
•	 potential	voting	rights	held	by	the	Company,	other	vote	holders	or	other	parties;
•	 rights	arising	from	other	contractual	arrangements;	and
•	 any	 additional	facts	and	circumstances	that	indicate	that	the	Company	has,	or	does	not	have,	the	current	ability	
to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous 
shareholders’ meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the 
Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year 
are included in profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to 
control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiary to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Basis of Consolidation (continued)
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of 
non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of 
net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate 
share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an  
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition 
plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company 
and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of 
the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit 
balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to 
reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the  
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly 
in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated 
as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of 
any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the 
subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities 
of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as required/permitted 
by applicable Standards). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control 
is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under MFRS 9 when applicable,  
or the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a 
business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of 
assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity 
interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in 
profit or loss as incurred.
For new acquisitions, the Group measures the cost of goodwill at the acquisition date as:
•	 the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	transferred;	plus
•	 the	recognised	amount	of	any	non-controlling	interests	in	the	acquiree;	plus
•	 if	 the	business	combination	is	achieved	in	stages,	the	fair	value	of	the	existing	equity	interest	in	the	acquiree;	
less
•	 the	net	recognised	amount	(generally	fair	value)	of	the	identifiable	assets	acquired	and	liabilities	assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in 
connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Business combinations (continued)
Non-controlling interests in subsidiary are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of 
non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of 
net assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate 
share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition 
by acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, 
the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the  
non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company 
and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of 
the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit 
balance.
Changes in Group’s ownership interest in existing subsidiary
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to 
reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the  
non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly 
in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated 
as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of 
any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the 
subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in 
relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities 
of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as required/permitted 
by applicable Standards). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control 
is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under MFRS 9 when applicable,  
or the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture.
Investment in a subsidiary company
Investment in a subsidiary company, which is eliminated on consolidation, is stated at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any in the Company’s financial statements. On disposal of such an investment, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is included in profit or loss.
Goodwill on consolidation
Goodwill arising on consolidation is initially recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the CGUs is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a 
subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary company, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of  
the gain or loss on disposal.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when a performance obligation in the contract with a customer is satisfied, i.e. when the 
“control” of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.  
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct goods or services (or a series of distinct goods  
or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer) to the customer that is  
explicitly stated in the contract and implied in the Group’s and Company’s customary business practices.
(i) Interest income/profit revenue and finance charges from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes 
and credit card business
Interest income/profit revenue and finance charges from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes 
and credit card business are recognised in profit or loss using the Effective Interest/Profit Rate (“EIR”) method.
EIR is a method of calculating the amortised cost of financing receivables and of allocating the corresponding 
interest income/profit revenue and finance charges over the relevant year. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financing receivable or, when appropriate,  
a shorter year to the net carrying amount of the financing receivables.
(ii) Fee income from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes, credit card business and extended 
warranty programme
Fee income from easy payment schemes and personal financing schemes comprise late payment/penalty 
charges, processing fees and credit recovery charges. Fee income from credit card business comprises 
credit recovery charges, cash advance fees, transaction charges, annual fees, merchant commission and  
Visa/MasterCard interchange fees. Fee income from extended warranty program comprises commission 
earned for referral of extended warranty programme.
Fee income is generally recognised when the relevant performance obligation has been fulfilled. 
(iii) Brokerage fee
Revenue from brokerage fee is recognised at a point in time when services are rendered.
Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and of the Company. Short-term accumulating 
compensated absences for paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees that 
increase their entitlement to future compensated absences. Short-term non-accumulating compensated 
absences such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occur.
(ii) Defined contribution plan
The Group and the Company are required by law to make monthly contributions to the Employees Provident 
Fund (“EPF”), a statutory defined contribution plan, for all its eligible employees based on certain prescribed 
rates of the employees’ salaries. The Group’s contributions to EPF are disclosed separately.

Foreign currency transactions
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are presented in RM, the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group and the Company operate (their functional currency).
In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Group’s and the Company’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.  
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at the end of the reporting period. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, 
are included in profit or loss for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items 
carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of 
non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary 
items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and is measured 
using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Current tax for 
current and prior years is recognised as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or recoverable).
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period 
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in 
a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit. In addition, a deferred tax liability is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the 
initial recognition of goodwill. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences 
and deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused 
tax credits to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiary except where the group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be 
recovered.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting 
period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner in which the Group and the Company expect, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle 
the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when  
it arises from a transaction which is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or to equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group and the Company intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Earnings per ordinary share
The Group and the Company present basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares (“EPS”).
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company, less distribution 
on perpetual notes and perpetual sukuk, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.  
Ordinary shares that would be issued upon conversion of a mandatorily convertible instrument are included in the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares from the date of issuance of the instrument.
Leases 
(i) Definition of a lease
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for  
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:
•	 the	 contract	involves	the	use	of	an	identified	asset	that	may	be	specified	explicitly	or	implicitly,	and	
should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset.  
If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;
•	 the	 customer	has	the	right	to	obtain	substantially	all	of	the	economic	benefits	from	use	of	the	asset	
throughout the period of use; and
	•	 the	 customer	has	the	right	to	direct	the	use	of	the	asset.	The	customer	has	this	right	when	it	has	the	
decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. 
In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined,  
the customer has the right to direct the use of the asset if either the customer has the right to operate 
the asset; or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it 
will be used.
At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group and the Company 
allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative 
stand-alone prices. 
(ii) Recognition and initial measurement
Company as a lessee
The Group and the Company recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement 
date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs 
incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying 
asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, the Group and the Company use their incremental borrowing rate.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Leases (continued)
(ii) Recognition and initial measurement (continued)
Company as a lessee (continued)
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
•	 Fixed	payments,	including	in-substance	fixed	payments	less	any	incentives	receivable;
•	 Variable	 lease	payments	that	depend	on	an	index	or	a	rate,	initially	measured	using	the	index	or	rate	as	at	
the commencement date;
•	 Amounts	expected	to	be	payable	under	a	residual	value	guarantee;	
•	 The	 exercise	price	under	a	purchase	option	that	the	Group	and	the	Company	are	reasonably	certain	to	
exercise the option; and
•	 Payments	 of	penalties	for	early	termination	of	a	lease,	if	the	lease	term	reflects	the	exercise	of	an	option	
to terminate the lease unless the Group and the Company are reasonably certain not to terminate early.
The Group and the Company have excluded variable lease payments that are linked to future performance or 
usage of the underlying asset from the lease liability. Instead, these payments are recognised in profit or loss in 
the period in which the performance or use occurs.
The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for  
short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets. The Group and the 
Company recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an operating expense on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
(iii) Subsequent measurement
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement 
date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.  
The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property,  
plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  
and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. 
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when 
there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a revision of 
in-substance fixed lease payments, or if there is a change in the Group’s and the Company’s estimates of the 
amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group and the Company change 
their its assessment of whether they will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.

Plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other costs 
directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the cost of dismantling 
and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to 
the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
When significant parts of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items (major components) of plant and equipment.
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying 
amount is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and 
the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to profit or loss during the financial period 
in which they are incurred.
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of 
individual assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that 
asset, then that component is depreciated separately.
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
component of an item of plant and equipment. Assets under capital-work-in-progress are not depreciated until 
the assets are ready for their intended use. 
The principal annual rates are as follows:
Office equipment 4 - 7 years
Computer equipment and software 2 - 10 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Furniture and fittings 2 - 4 years
Renovation 4 - 5 years
The depreciable amount is determined after deducting the residual value.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of each reporting period.

Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss 
is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value-in-use,  
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets
(i) Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group and the 
Company become a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
A financial asset is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issuance.
(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
The Group and the Company have applied MFRS 9 and classified the financial assets in the following 
measurement categories - amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or fair 
value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).
The Group and the Company determine the classification of financial assets upon initial recognition.  
The financial assets are not subsequently reclassified unless the Group or the Company changes the business 
model for managing financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of 
the first reporting period following the change of the business model.
(a) Amortised cost
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the financial assets are held within a business model 
whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the  
EIR method. Interest income/profit revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in 
profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.

Financial assets (continued)
(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (continued)
(b) FVTOCI
The Group and the Company designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading 
as financial assets measured at FVTOCI on initial recognition. Investments in equity instruments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and 
losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the fair value reserve. The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the 
equity investments; instead, it is transferred to retained earnings. 
Dividends on equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s or the Company’s right 
to receive payment is established. 
(c) FVTPL 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above are measured 
at FVTPL. This includes derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group and the Company 
may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at 
amortised cost or at FVTOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting 
mismatch that would otherwise arise. Financial assets categorised as FVTPL are subsequently measured 
at their fair value with gains or losses recognised in the profit or loss. 
(iii) Derecognition of financial assets
(a) Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions
The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset, such as a financing to a customer, when the 
terms and conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financing, 
with the difference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has 
not already been recorded. The newly recognised financing are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement 
purposes.
When assessing whether or not to derecognise a financing to a customer, amongst others, the Group and 
the Company consider the following factors:
•	 If	 the	customer	is	in	financial	difficulty,	whether	the	modification	merely	reduces	the	contractual	
cash flows to amounts the customer is expected to be able to pay;
•	 Significant	extension	of	the	financing	term	when	the	customer	is	not	in	financial	difficulty;	and
•	 Significant	change	in	the	interest/profit	rate.
If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not 
result in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group and 
the Company record a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already 
been recorded.

Financial assets (continued)
(iii) Derecognition of financial assets (continued)
(b) Derecognition other than for substantial modification 
The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the  
cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group or the Company neither transfers nor 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group or the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for 
amounts it may have to pay. If the Group or the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group or the Company continues to recognise the financial 
asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. 
On derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument which the Group or the Company has elected 
on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the 
investments revaluation reserve is not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. 
Impairment of financial assets
Under MFRS 9, impairment model requires the recognition of expected credit loss (“ECL”) for all financial assets, 
except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity instruments classified under FVTOCI,  
which are not subject to impairment assessment. 
The Group and the Company assess ECL associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost. The Group 
and the Company recognise a loss allowance for such losses at the end of each reporting period. The measurement 
of ECL reflects an unbiased amount that is determined by reasonable as well as supportable information that is 
available without undue cost or effort at the end of the reporting period about past events and current conditions. 
Allowance for impairment will be made based on the following three-stage approach which reflects the change in 
credit quality of the financial instrument since initial recognition:
(i) Stage 1: 12-month ECL - not credit-impaired
For exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and that are 
not credit-impaired upon origination, the ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring within 
next 12 months will be recognised. 
(ii) Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired
For exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but that are not 
credit-impaired, a lifetime ECL will be recognised. 
(iii) Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired
Financial assets are assessed as credit-impaired when one or more events that have detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. For financial assets that are credit-impaired, a lifetime 
ECL will be recognised.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Impairment of financial assets (continued)
The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) (i.e. the magnitude 
of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default (“EAD”). The assessment of the PD and LGD are based 
on the Group’s and the Company’s historical experience and informed credit assessment with consideration of  
forward-looking information.
As for the EAD, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for 
financial guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with 
any additional amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend,  
the Group’s and the Company’s understanding of the specific future financing needs of the customers, and other  
relevant forward-looking information. 
In the measurement of ECL, forward-looking adjustment is in accordance with the expected future macroeconomic 
conditions, including combination of statistical analysis and expert judgements based on the availability of 
detailed information. In addition, key macroeconomic variables encompassed in ECL measurement include  
probability-weighted scenarios based on available forecasts.
Significant increase in credit risk
At the end of each reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition to determine whether the exposure is subject to 12-month  
ECL or lifetime ECL. This is performed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected 
life from the reporting date and the date of initial recognition. When determining whether the risk of default has 
increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group and the Company consider both quantitative information 
and analysis based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical experience. 
The Group and the Company assess whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly on an 
individual or collective basis. For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped 
on a basis of shared credit risk characteristics, taking into account the collection mode, disbursement period and 
other relevant factors.
If, in a subsequent period, the asset quality improves and also reverses any previously assessed significant increase 
in credit risk since origination, then the loss allowance for that financial asset reverts from lifetime ECL to 12-month 
ECL.
The Group and the Company determine whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on number 
of days past due since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received.  
Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. The Group 
and the Company presume that the credit risk of a borrower has increased significantly since initial recognition when 
contractual payment are more than 30 days past due.
Credit impaired (default)
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether financial assets at amortised cost are credit 
impaired. A financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated 
future cash flows on the financial assets have occurred. 
The Group and the Company consider a financial asset to be in default when the principal or interest/profit or  
both the financing is past due for more than 90 days.
Forward-looking information
Forward-looking information considered include the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s and the 
Company’s customers work in, obtained from reports of economic experts, financial analysts, governmental bodies, 
relevant think-tanks and other similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and 
forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s and the Company’s core operations.

Write-offs 
The Group and the Company write-off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the customer is in 
severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets written off may still be subject 
to enforcement activities under the Group’s and the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal 
advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another 
enterprise, or to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable. Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at “FVTPL” or “other financial liabilities”. 
Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense 
over the relevant period. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the 
expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and 
the recognition of a new liability, and the differences in the respective carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all 
of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group and the Company are recognised at the proceeds received,  
net of direct issue costs.
(i) Perpetual notes
Perpetual notes are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to redeem the instrument. 
Distributions on perpetual notes are recognised in equity in the year in which they are paid. The transaction 
costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of tax. Equity transaction costs 
comprise only those incremental external costs directly attributable to the equity transaction which would 
otherwise have been avoided. 
(ii) Perpetual sukuk
Perpetual sukuk is classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to redeem the instrument. 
Distributions on perpetual sukuk are recognised in equity in the year in which they are paid. The transaction 
costs of an equity transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of tax. Equity transaction costs 
comprise only those incremental external costs directly attributable to the equity transaction which would 
otherwise have been avoided.
(iii) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. Costs directly attributable to equity transactions are 
accounted for as a deduction, net of tax, from equity. 
Distributions to holders of ordinary shares are debited directly to equity and interim dividends declared on 
or before the end of the reporting date are recognised as liabilities. Final dividends are recognised upon the 
approval of shareholders in a general meeting.

Derivative instruments
The Group and the Company enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and 
foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency 
swaps. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately unless the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument, in which event the timing of 
the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group and the Company document the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking 
various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group and the 
Company document whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of 
the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following 
hedge effectiveness requirements:
•	 there	is	an	economic	relationship	between	the	hedged	item	and	the	hedging	instrument;
•	 the	effect	of	credit	risk	does	not	dominate	the	value	changes	that	result	from	that	economic	relationship;	and
•	 the	 hedge	ratio	of	the	hedging	relationship	is	the	same	as	that	resulting	from	the	quantity	of	the	hedged	item	
that the Group and the Company actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group 
and the Company actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. 
Cash flow hedge
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable in a particular  
risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect the profit 
or loss. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that 
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under 
the heading of hedging reserve, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of 
the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Subsequently, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity 
into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss.  
If the hedge item is a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income is removed from equity and included in the initial amount of the asset or liability. However, loss recognised 
in other comprehensive income that will not be recovered in one or more future periods is reclassified from equity 
into profit or loss. 
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated 
or exercised, the hedge is no longer highly effective, the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the 
hedge designation is revoked. If the hedge is for a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, any related cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income on the hedging 
instrument is reclassified from equity into profit or loss.
A financial liability or a part of it is derecognised when, and only when, the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expired. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying 
amount of the financial liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any 
non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents 
The Group and the Company adopt the indirect method in the preparation of the statements of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances, deposits placed with licensed banks and short-term 
highly liquid investments which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the 
statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts, cash held in trust for 
customers and deposits held in trust account.
Provisions
Provisions are made when the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when 
a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at the Group’s and the 
Company’s best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
At the end of the reporting period, provisions are reviewed and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Provisions 
are reversed if it is no longer probable that the Group and the Company will be required to settle the obligation.
4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Critical judgement in applying the Company’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, 
management is of the opinion that there are no instances of application of judgement which are expected to have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the end of each reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year other than as follows:
(i) Impairment loss on financing receivables (Note 11) 
The expected credit loss for measurement of impairment losses under MFRS 9 requires judgement.  
The impairment losses computed based on ECL models are outputs of complex models with a number of 
underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. A number of 
significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring impairment 
losses, such as determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk, choosing the appropriate models, 
determining the suitability of forward-looking information and the number of probability weighting outcome 
scenarios. 
As the current MFRS 9 models are not expected to generate levels of ECL with sufficient reliability in light of 
prevalent uncertainties pertaining to COVID-19 pandemic, management judgement and overlays have been 
applied to determine an adequate overall level of ECL for the financial years ended 28 February 2023 and  
28 February 2022. These overlays took into consideration the latest macroeconomic outlook not captured 
in the modeled outcome and the potential impact to delinquencies and defaults when the various relief and 
support measures offered to customers. The overlays involved a significant level of judgement and reflect 
the management’s views of possible effects of the pandemic and paths of recovery in the forward-looking 
assessment for ECL estimation purposes.
Customers who have received repayment supports remain in their existing delinquency stages unless they have 
been individually identified as not viable or with subsequent indicators of significant increase in credit risk from 
COVID-19. The impact of these overlays, which are estimated at portfolio level and remained outside the core 
MFRS 9 process, amounted to RM105,036,000 (2022: RM118,149,000).

(ii) Deferred tax assets (Note 10) 
The Group and the Company assess at the end of the reporting period whether there is probable and sufficient 
future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be 
recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning 
strategies.
(iii) Fair value estimation of financial instruments (Note 8 and Note 14)
The fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value is determined using a variety of valuation techniques. 
The Group and the Company generally use widely recognised valuation models with market observable inputs, 
judgement is required where market observable data are not available. Such judgement normally incorporate 
assumptions that other market participants would use in their valuations, including assumptions about interest 
rate yield curves, exchange rates, volatilities, discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections.

STATEMENTS

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
The main risks and corresponding management policies arising from the Group’s and the Company’s normal course 
of business are as follows:
(i) Financial risk management objectives and policies
Risk management forms an integral part of the Group’s and of the Company’s activities and remains an important 
feature in all its business, operations, delivery channels and decision making processes. The extent to which 
the Group and the Company are able to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report each of the various types 
of risk is critical to its strength, soundness and profitability. The Group’s and the Company’s risk management 
function is independent of its operating units. All new businesses, introduction of new products, engagement 
in new activities or entry into new strategic alliances are subject to review by the Risk Management Committee 
(“RMC”) and Board Risk Committee (“BRC”) prior to Board of Directors’ (“the Board”) approval.
The objectives of the Group’s and of the Company’s risk management activities are to:
•	 Identify	and	monitor	the	various	risk	exposure	and	risk	requirements;
•	 Ensure	 high	risk	activities	are	in	accordance	with	the	approved	policies	and	the	aggregate	risk	position	is	
within the risk level approved by the Board; and
•	 Help	 to	create	shareholders	value	through	proper	allocation	and	management	of	risk,	and	facilitate	the	
risk assessment of new business and products independently. 
(ii) Risk management framework
The Group and the Company employ an Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework (“ERMF”) to manage 
its risks effectively. The framework involves on-going process of identifying, evaluating, monitoring, managing 
and reporting significant risks affecting the Group and the Company through the RMC and subsequently to 
BRC and Board. This framework provides the Board and management with a tool to anticipate and manage 
both existing and potential risks, taking into consideration the dynamic risk profiles, as dictated by changes in 
business strategies, regulatory environment and functional activities throughout the year.
(iii) Risk organisation and reporting
The responsibility of risk management lies with the Board. In line with best practices, the Board determines 
the risk policy objectives for the Group and the Company, and assumes responsibility for the supervision of 
risk management. To this end, the Board is assisted by BRC to provide primary oversight responsibilities on the 
Group’s and the Company’s risk management.
The day-to-day responsibility for risk management and control is delegated to the RMC which undertakes the 
oversight function for overall risk limit and ensures that the Group and the Company are within the risk appetite 
as established by the Board. The RMC also deliberates the implementation of the ERMF which addresses credit, 
market, operational and strategic risks within the policies established by the respective business units and 
recommending policy changes to BRC for review, and subsequently to the Board for approval.
Risk exposures, impact and mitigation measures which cover all areas of risk faced by the Group and the 
Company are reviewed and updated regularly to BRC and the Board to ensure relevance and compliance with 
current and applicable laws and regulations.
The Group and the Company have exposure to the following significant risks in the course of undertaking  
its ordinary business activities:
(a) Credit risk
(b) Liquidity risk
(c) Market risk

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(iii) Risk organisation and reporting (continued)
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company due to the deterioration in credit 
worthiness of its borrowers and consequently, their ability to discharge their contractual obligations 
to the Group and the Company. Credit risk remains the most significant risk to which the Group and 
the Company are exposed. The purpose of credit risk management is to manage or maintain credit risk 
exposure at an acceptable level, in line with the Group’s and the Company’s risk appetite and to ensure 
that the returns are commensurate to the risk taken.
The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arises principally from its financing receivables, 
cash, bank balances and deposits, other receivables and amount owing by related companies.
Receivables
(i) Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group and the Company have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is 
monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit 
and the credit acceptance procedures are monitored by the management. Collateral is required 
for the business of financing vehicles, equipment and machineries. Other than this, the Group and 
the Company do not require collateral in respect of the easy payment schemes, personal financing 
schemes and credit cards issuance business. 
The Group and the Company conduct regular monitoring on credit exposure trend and portfolio 
concentration analysis. Asset quality is closely monitored so that deteriorating exposure is  
promptly identified, analysed and reviewed with relevant business units. 
(ii) Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
At end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company do not have any significant exposure to 
any individual customers or industry sector. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by 
the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The Group and the Company do not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover 
its credit risks associated with its financial assets, except that the credit risk associated with hire 
purchase financing receivables is mitigated because they are secured over the vehicles, equipment 
and machineries of customers. The carrying amount of hire purchase financing receivables  
amounted to RM6,198,590,000 (2022: RM5,731,859,000). There has not been any significant  
change in the quality of the collateral held for hire purchase financing. The Group and the Company 
recognise a loss allowance for these hire purchase financing receivables based on the ECL model  
of the Group and of the Company.
(iii) Credit risk reporting and monitoring
The Group’s and the Company’s credit portfolios are monitored through monthly and/or adhoc 
reporting to ensure credit deterioration is promptly detected and mitigated through implementation 
of risk remediation strategies. Credit Planning Department undertakes regular and comprehensive 
analysis of credit portfolios and reports to the RMC on emerging credit issues.
(iv) Credit risk mitigation
All credit facilities are granted on the credit standing of the borrower, source of repayment,  
debt servicing ability and the collateral pledged. Personal guarantees are obtained when the 
borrower’s credit worthiness is insufficient to justify granting facilities.
(v) Concentration risk
Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of customers are engaged in similar business 
activities or activities within the same geographic region, or when they have similar risk characteristics 
that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in 
economic or other conditions. The Group and the Company monitor various portfolios to identify 
and assess risk concentrations. The credit portfolios are monitored and reviewed to identify, assess 
and guard against unacceptable risk concentrations.

(a) Credit risk (continued)
Credit quality and allowance for impairment losses (continued)
Renegotiated/restructured activities include extended payment arrangements, and the modification 
and deferral of payments. The Group and the Company have recognised allowance for impairment loss 
of RM111,674,000 (2022: RM101,553,000) for these renegotiated/restructured financing receivables.  
The status of net renegotiated/restructured receivables are as follows:
  Group and Company
  2023 2022
  RM’000 RM’000
Past due 0 to 30 days 136,172 129,623
Past due 31 to 60 days 3,382 7,036
Past due 61 to 90 days 1,742 5,222
Past due more than 90 days 2,217 4,395
  143,513 146,276
Cash, bank balances and deposits
The cash, bank balances and deposits are placed only with reputable licensed banks and financial 
institutions and have low credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by government 
agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the risk of loss for this category 
of financial instrument is low, and no loss allowance is provided. 
Other receivables
Credit risks on other receivables are mainly arising from sundry receivables. As at the end of the reporting 
period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements 
of financial position. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company do not consider 
it necessary to recognise any allowance for impairment losses.
Amount owing by related companies
The Group and the Company provide unsecured advances to related companies. The Group and the 
Company monitor the ability of the related companies to repay the advances on an individual basis.  
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying 
amounts in the statement of financial position. Generally, the Group and the Company consider balances 
with related companies as having low credit risk. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the 
Company did not recognise any allowance for impairment losses.

(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations 
as they fall due. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various 
payables and borrowings.
The Group’s and the Company’s liquidity risk management practices are to maintain high quality and 
well diversified portfolios of liquid assets and source of funds under both normal business and stressed 
conditions. The Group and the Company maintain optimum ratio of long term funding, i.e. debts 
maturing after 12 months from the end of the reporting period against total debts. This ratio significantly 
matches the ratio of long term financing receivables determined based on customers’ contracted terms 
of repayment and payment pattern for revolving credit limits granted.
The Treasury unit reviews the asset and liability maturity profile and identifies any maturity mismatch for 
escalation to the RMC which is responsible for the independent monitoring of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s liquidity risk profile. The RMC meets every month to discuss the liquidity risk and funding 
profile of the Group and of the Company and works closely with the Treasury unit on the surveillance of 
market conditions and stress testing analysis on liquidity positions. The Group maintains sufficient credit 
lines to ensure that all current obligations are able to be met. As at 28 February 2023, the Group and 
the Company have unutilised lines of credit amounting to RM4,561,000,000 (2022: RM4,509,000,000) 
obtained from licensed banks and financial institutions.

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(iii) Risk organisation and reporting (continued)
(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of potential loss as a result of changes in the intrinsic value of financial instruments 
caused by movement in market variables such as interest rate/profit rate, currency exchange rates, 
equity pricing and other related macro-economic factors that will eventually affect the Group’s and the 
Company’s profitability, cash flows and capital preservation.
The Group’s and the Company’s market risk management include the monitoring of the fluctuations in net 
interest income/profit revenue or investment value due to changes in relevant risk factors. RMC monitors 
the exposure on monthly basis through reports and analysis with the support of the Treasury unit.
In managing interest income/profit revenue rate, the Group and the Company intend to maximise net 
interest income/profit revenue; and to minimise the significant volatility in relation to the Group’s and the 
Company’s assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s and the Company’s fixed rate borrowings and derivatives are exposed to a risk of change in 
their fair value due to changes in the interest income/profit revenue rates. The Group’s and the Company’s 
variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.  
The other financial assets and liabilities are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group and the Company borrow for their operations at fixed and variable rates and monitor the 
interest rate exposure by assessing the interest rate gap of interest bearing financial assets and financial 
liabilities. The Group and the Company also use cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate 
risk on bank borrowings as stated in hedging activities below. The management continuously seeks for 
alternative banking facilities, which provide competitive interest rates to finance their capital expenditure, 
financing and working capital requirements.
Exposure to interest risk
The interest rate profile of the Group’s and of the Company’s significant interest-banking financial 
instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period is shown below:

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
(a) Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at 
fair value through profit or loss and the Group and the Company designate derivatives as hedging 
instruments under the cash flow hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rate at the 
end of the reporting period would not affect profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A change of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would have 
increased/(decreased) equity and pre-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis 
assumes that all other variables remained constant.

Cash flow hedge
The Group and the Company have entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge 
the variability of cash flow risk in relation to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of 
RM3,668,097,000 (2022: RM3,401,860,000). The cross currency interest rate swaps have the same 
notional value of RM3,668,097,000 (2022: RM3,401,860,000) and are to be settled in full upon 
maturity, on terms matching the hedged items.
The following table indicates the years in which the cash flows associated with the derivative financial 
assets with carrying amount is RM226,666,000 (2022: RM26,057,000) and derivative financial liabilities

Currency risk
The Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk mainly on borrowings that are 
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group and of the Company.  
The currency which gives rise to this risk is primarily USD and JPY.

The repayment of all borrowings in foreign currencies is fully hedged by cross currency interest rate 
swaps entered into by the Group and the Company upon initial drawdown of the borrowings.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
35. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
The methods and assumptions used by management to determine the fair value of the financial instruments are as 
follows:
(i) Financing receivables
The fair value of financing receivables with remaining maturity of less than one year are estimated to approximate 
their carrying amounts. For financing receivables with remaining maturity of more than one year, the fair values 
are estimated based on discounted cash flows using prevailing rates of loans and receivables of similar credit 
profile.
(ii) Term loans/financing
The fair value of term loans/financing with remaining maturity of less than one year are estimated to approximate 
their carrying amounts. For term loans/financing with remaining maturity of more than one year, the fair values 
are estimated using discounting technique. The discount rates are based on market rates available to the  
Group and the Company for similar instruments.
(iii) Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of cross currency swap derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group and the Company 
would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the end of reporting period and is determined based on 
discounted future cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates (from observable 
yield curves at the end of the reporting period), forward exchange rates (from observable forward exchange 
rates at the end of reporting period), contract interest rates and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that 
reflects the credit risk of counterparties.
(iv) Other investments
The fair value of other investments are based on the expected cash flows discounted as at reporting date.  
The discounted cash flow method was used to capture the present value of the expected future economic 
benefits to be derived from the ownership of these investees. The key inputs are discount rate, terminal growth 
rate and discount for lack of control, as described in this Note. 
(v) Other financial instruments
The fair value of other instruments are determined to approximate to its carrying value due to the short term 
nature of these financial instruments. 
The fair value hierarchies used to classify financial instruments not measured at fair value in the statements of financial 
position, but for which fair value is disclosed, are as follows:
(i) Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(ii) Level 2 :  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
(iii) Level 3 : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following table shows a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value 
measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
(iii) Ordinary Resolution 4 to 12 on the Re-election of Directors
Each of the Director standing for re-election had undergone a performance evaluation and had provided his/her annual declaration 
on his/her fitness and propriety to continue acting as Directors of the Company in accordance with the Fit and Proper Policy of 
the Group, as well as the confirmation of their independence (as the case may be). Upon the Nominating Committee’s (“NC”) 
assessment, the performance and suitability of each of the retiring Directors was found to be satisfactory and that each of the retiring 
Directors had demonstrated his/her commitment to the role and continues to be an effective and valuable member of the Board. 
Based on the above premise, the NC had recommended for the retiring Directors to be re-elected at the 26th AGM and the Board 
had endorsed NC’s recommendations. The retiring Directors had abstained from deliberations and decisions on their re-election at 
the NC and Board meetings.
The profiles of the Directors who are standing for re-election under Ordinary Resolutions 4 to 12 are set out in the Board of  
Directors’ profiles of the Integrated Annual Report 2023.
 Retirement of Director
Datin Khoo Pek Ling has expressed her intention not to seek re-election. Hence, she will retain office until the conclusion of the 
26th AGM.
(iv) Ordinary Resolution 14 - Proposed Renewal of Authority for Directors to Allot and Issue Shares and Waiver of Pre-Emptive 
Rights pursuant to the Act
The Company had, during its Twenty-Fifth (25th) AGM held on 29 June 2022, obtained its shareholders’ approval for the general 
mandate for issuance of shares pursuant to Section 75 and 76 of the Act. As at the date of the notice, the Company did not issue any 
shares pursuant to this mandate obtained. 
The Ordinary Resolution 14 proposed under item 7 of the Agenda is a renewal of the general mandate for issuance of shares by the 
Company under Section 75 and 76 of the Act. The resolution, if passed, will provide flexibility for the Company and empower the 
Directors to allot and issue new shares speedily in the Company up to an amount not exceeding in total ten per centum (10%) of the 
issued shares (excluding treasury shares) of the Company for such purpose as the Directors consider would be in the interest of the 
Company. This would eliminate any delay arising from and cost involved in convening a general meeting to obtain approval of the 
shareholders for such issuance of shares. This authority, unless revoked or varied by the Company at a general meeting, will expire 
at the next AGM of the Company.
The authority will provide flexibility for the Company for any possible fund raising activities, including but not limited to further 
placing of shares for purpose of funding investment project(s) working capital and/or acquisition(s).
The waiver of pre-emptive rights pursuant to Section 85 of the Act. By voting in favour of the Resolution 14, the shareholders of the 
Company would be waiving their pre-emptive rights. The Resolution 14 if passed, would allow the Directors to issue new shares to 
any person under the Proposed General Mandate without having to offer the new Company shares to be issued equally to all existing 
shareholders of the Company prior to issuance.
(v) Ordinary Resolution 15 - Proposed Shareholders’ Mandate 
The Ordinary Resolution 15 proposed under item 8 of the Agenda, if passed, will allow the Group to enter into recurrent related  
party transactions in accordance with paragraph 10.09 of the MMLR of Bursa Securities and without the necessity to convene 
separate general meetings from time to time to seek shareholders’ approval as and when such recurrent related party transactions 
occur. This would reduce substantial administrative time and expenses associated with the convening of such meetings without 
compromising the corporate objectives of the Company or affecting the business opportunities available to the Company.  
The shareholders’ mandate is subject to renewal on an annual basis.    
Further information on the Proposed Shareholders’ Mandate is set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 23 May 2023.
