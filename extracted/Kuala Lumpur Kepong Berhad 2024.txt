CORPORATE PROFILE
PLANTATION
Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad (”KLK”) started as a plantation 
company in 1906 and until today, the development of oil palm  
and rubber remains the Group’s core business. KLK presently  
has about 300,000 hectares of planted area (97% oil palm).  
Our landbank is spread across Malaysia (Peninsular and  
Sabah), Indonesia (Belitung Island, Sumatra, as well as 
Kalimantan), and Liberia.
PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
In 1990, KLK started capitalising on the strategic location of  
its landbank in Peninsular Malaysia by branching into property 
development under KLK Land. Our first foray into property 
development was Sierramas in Sungai Buloh, a joint venture with 
Tan & Tan Developments Berhad, a wholly owned subsidiary of 
IGB Berhad. It is currently focused on Bandar Seri Coalfields, 
a 1,001-acre township in Sungai Buloh and Caledonia in Ijok, 
Selangor.
MANUFACTURING
In order to optimise value across the supply 
chain, KLK diversified into resource-based 
manufacturing (refinery and oleochemical), and 
vertically integrated its upstream, midstream and 
downstream businesses. The Group has since 
expanded its manufacturing operations resulting 
in an international oleochemicals operations in 
Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Switzerland, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.

CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
TAN SRI DATO’ SERI 
LEE OI HIAN
Executive Chairman
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to present the Annual Report of 
Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad for the 
Financial Year ended 30 September 
2024.
2024 has been a year of both challenges and  
opportunities for KLK, shaped by a volatile global  
environment. Rising inflation, supply chain disruptions and 
fluctuating commodity prices created uncertainty across 
industries. Geopolitical tensions and economic slowdowns 
in key markets further added to the complexity. However,  
the palm oil sector benefitted from strong Crude Palm Oil 
(“CPO”) prices, supported by supply constraints and the 
upcoming Indonesian biodiesel mandate. Despite these  
positive factors, unpredictable weather patterns and shifting 
trade conditions continued to affect the broader market  
landscape.

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
PERFORMANCE
These external factors influenced the Group’s  
performance, creating both opportunities and challenges 
across different segments. For FY2024, the Group  
recorded a pre-tax profit of RM1.183 billion, slightly 
higher than FY2023’s RM1.152 billion, contributed by a 
solid upstream performance. However, the Group’s net 
profit attributable to shareholders was RM591.0 million,  
a decrease from RM843.3 million in FY2023, primarily  
due to exceptional losses amounting to RM366.5 million, 
including impairment and equity losses from Synthomer 
plc, and an inventory write-down from KLK Hardwood 
Flooring Sdn Bhd. Excluding these losses, the Group’s  
net profit would have been RM957.5 million.
The Plantation segment remained the key driver of our 
performance, delivering a 39% increase in pre-tax profit 
to RM1.618 billion, thanks to higher CPO and Palm 
Kernel prices, improved FFB yields and effective cost  
management. On the other hand, the Manufacturing  
segment faced challenges, with a 64% decline in  
pre-tax profit to RM95.3 million (FY2023 RM264.7 million). 
This was largely due to margin pressure in the midstream 
refinery sub-segment, resulting from overcapacity in the 
refining industry and the unexpected rise in CPO prices.
The Property division continued to contribute steadily,  
with a 5% increase in revenue to RM229.4 million.  
However, pre-tax profit declined by 25% to RM46.4 million 
(FY2023: RM61.5 million) reflecting reduced margins in 
certain developments.
Based on an earnings per share of 54.3 sen, the Board 
is recommending a final dividend of 40 sen per share, in 
addition to the earlier interim dividend of 20 sen.
DRIVING PROGRESS WITH OUR VISION  
AND MISSION
As we reflect on the year, we took the opportunity to  
revisit and refine the Group’s vision and mission, 
ensuring they remain aligned with our evolving direction.  
Our updated vision found in page 6 is to be a globally 
recognised and trusted agri-based organisation, known  
for both our operational efficiency and the strong values  
we uphold. We are committed to lead by example within  
the industry, striving to be a responsible steward of both  
the resources we manage and the people in our care.
Our mission reinforces this commitment by focusing on 
growth, innovation and sustainability. We are dedicated 
to achieve operational excellence through the pursuit of 
industry-leading productivity, empowering our people to 
realise their full potential and making a positive impact on 
society and the environment. All of this is underpinned by 
our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of 
ethics and governance.
STRENGTHENING INTEGRITY 
This year has also presented a crucial checkpoint  
for the Group to reflect on our journey to reaffirm 
our commitment to our core values, encapsulated in  
T.H.R.I.I.L.. As we have navigated a year of significant 
challenges and changes, we have taken deliberate and 
substantial steps to ensure that all of our actions and 
decisions align with the highest ethical standards.
This period of reflection has prompted us to evaluate 
our practices thoroughly, to ensure transparency and 
accountability across all our operations, from leadership 
to day-to-day actions. We have scrutinised our  
processes, identified areas for improvement and worked 
diligently to address any gaps or inconsistencies.  
Integrity is not just about following rules, but also 
about fostering an environment where ethical conduct 
guides our decision-making at every level. This ongoing  
reflection and dedication to ethical conduct will 
remain central to our efforts, as we build a stronger,  
more resilient organisation for the future.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
At this juncture, I would like to take the opportunity to 
highlight key events and express my gratitude for the 
support we have received this year. 
Following the retirement of Raja Tun Alias this year,  
I would like to take a moment to acknowledge his  
significant contributions to the KLK Board. Having served 
for over 45 years, including the last 15 as Chairman, his 
broad experience in sectors such as shipping, banking, 
and retail has greatly benefited KLK. We are where we are 
today thanks to his guidance and support. As a tribute to his 
impact, we produced a book titled “R.M. Alias: Leadership, 
Legacy and Life at Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad” to 
capture his legacy. Alongside my late father, Tan Sri Dato’ 
Seri Lee Loy Seng, Raja Tun Alias has been a key figure in 
KLK’s history. My father’s story is preserved in “The Taiko  
of Plantations,” and now Raja Tun Alias’s legacy is  
honoured in this new work.

Budget 2025 consultation meeting with YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim 
with key government officials and industry leaders
This year, KLK also had the privilege of hosting Prime 
Minister YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim alongside Menteri 
Besar Perak YAB Dato’ Seri Saarani Mohamad, Minister 
of Plantation and Commodities Datuk Seri Johari Abdul  
Ghani, Chief Secretary to the Government (KSN) Tan Sri 
Dato’ Sri Shamsul Azri Abu Bakar, Treasury Secretary 
General Datuk Johan Mahmood Merican, Ministry of 
Plantation & Commodities Secretary General Dato’ Yusran 
Shah bin Mohd Yusof and a delegation of oil palm industry 
leaders, for a focus group discussion in conjunction  
with the Budget 2025 consultation. This reinforced the 
government’s continued commitment to the growth of  
the palm oil industry.
We also welcomed YB Datuk Chan Foong Hin, Deputy 
Minister of Plantation and Commodities, and his  
delegation to our KLK Oleomas site and Taiko Palm-Oleo 
Zhangjiagang (“TPOZ”) in China. These visits underscored  
the government’s support for the growth of the palm  
oleo-based oleochemical sector, which remains a key  
focus for KLK.
We are also pleased to welcome Alami Commodities  
to the KLK family through our joint venture, KLK Alami  
Edible Oils. This partnership will target the Middle 
East market, with a refinery and packaging plant in  
Teluk Panglima Garang, Selangor, set to be fully  
operational by 2025.
I also congratulate Mr. Kow Tiat Yong on his promotion 
to CEO of KLK OLEO, and I am confident he will lead  
the division into its next phase of growth, with the full 
support of Mr. Lee Jia Zhang, who will continue as Group 
Chief Operating Officer.
Finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the 
Board, Management, and employees for their unwavering 
dedication and resilience. It is through their efforts,  
grounded in our core values, that we continue to thrive.  
I also thank our stakeholders for their trust and  
continued support as we look toward the future.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
As we conclude the year, 2024 has been a year of  
navigating challenges, but it has also highlighted the 
resilience and adaptability of KLK’s operations. While  
non-recurring losses in certain units impacted our overall 
results, we have taken proactive steps to address these 
challenges. Through strategic measures and a thorough 
evaluation of our practices, we have strengthened our 
foundation and are already seeing positive results from  
our mitigation strategies.
Looking ahead, we are more committed than ever to 
achieving operational excellence, underpinned by integrity, 
strong governance and sustainability. We will continue 
to optimise costs, refine our processes and enhance  
the best practices that have been key to our success.  
As we address areas where challenges remain,  
we remain confident in our ability to navigate the evolving  
landscape and build on our core strengths for long-term 
growth.
Thank you.

MANAGEMENT 
DISCUSSION & 
ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
For the financial year under review, the Group recorded a pre-tax 
profit of RM1.183 billion in FY2024 (FY2023: RM1.152 billion), 
driven by a strong upstream contribution of RM1.618 billion. 
However, the Group’s Profit After Tax and Minority Interests 
(“PATAMI”) decreased to RM591.0 million, compared to RM834.3 
million in FY2023. This decline was primarily due to tax losses 
not recognised and exceptional losses totalling RM366.5 million. 
This includes RM315.7 million from the Group’s investment in 
Synthomer plc, which consists of an impairment of RM180.0 
million and a share of equity loss of RM135.7 million. Additionally, 
there was an inventory write-down of RM50.8 million from KLK 
Hardwood Flooring Sdn Bhd. These exceptional items are non-
cash and non-recurring. Excluding these losses, the Group’s 
PATAMI would have been RM957.5 million.
The Plantation segment remains the key driver of the Group’s 
performance, delivering one of its best performances in  
the last five years, with a 39% increase in pre-tax profit to  
RM1.618 billion, compared to RM1.164 billion in FY2023. 
This strong performance was supported primarily by a 
reduction in production costs, marginal increase in fresh 
fruit bunch (“FFB”) yields and higher Crude Palm Oil 
(“CPO”) prices. In fact, CPO prices have risen to the height 
of RM5,000 per metric tonne, driven by concerns over 
reduced production and the anticipated Indonesian B40  
biodiesel mandate next year, despite ample soybean stocks.
Overall, average CPO and PK prices realised for FY2024 were 
RM3,653/mt (FY2023: RM3,639/mt) and RM2,115/mt (FY2023: 
RM1,841/mt) respectively. With ongoing cost optimisation 
efforts and further yield improvements, the Plantation segment  
is expected to continue performing well. CPO prices are 
forecasted to be rangebound within RM4,500 to RM5,200 per 
metric tonne in the year ahead.
Meanwhile, the Manufacturing segment recorded a 64% decline  
in pre-tax profit, which amounted to RM95.3 million compared  
to RM264.7 million in the previous year. The weaker  
performance was primarily due to significantly lower 
contributions from the midstream refinery sub-segment, which 
faced adverse margins arising from overcapacity in the refining 
industry and the unexpected rise in CPO prices. However,  
the Oleochemical sub-segment demonstrated encouraging 
recovery in both Malaysia and Europe, although challenges 
persist in China. The Group is optimistic about the outlook  
for FY2025, with expectations for continued improvements  
in the Oleochemical sub-segment.
2024 HIGHLIGHTS
In December 2023, KLK through our  
subsidiary KLK Plantations and Trading 
Pte Ltd, acquired a 92% stake in PT Satu 
Sembilan Delapan and a 90% stake in PT 
Tekukur Indah bringing our total planted  
area to 300,028 hectares.
Plantation segment remains the key driver 
of the Group’s performance, delivering one  
of its best performances in the last five  
years, with a 39% increase in pre-tax  
profit to RM1.618 billion , compared to 
RM1.164 billion in FY2023.
KLK Land has entered the industrial  
property sector  through a joint venture  
with AME Elite Consortium Bhd to develop  
a new industrial park in Ijok, Selangor.
Oleochemical sub-segment demonstrated 
encouraging recovery in both Malaysia 
and Europe, although challenges persist in  
China. The Group is optimistic about the 
outlook for FY2025, with expectations for 
continued improvements in the Oleochemical 
sub-segment.
The Group recorded RM1.183 billion  in  
pre-tax profit.

The Property division remains a consistent contributor  
to the Group, primarily driven by its development in 
Caledonia, Ijok, including the mid-market Ayana terrace 
houses and Caledonia Avenue shops. Despite a 5%  
increase in revenue to RM229.4 million (FY2023: RM218.1 
million), pre-tax profit decreased to RM46.4 million,  
reflecting a 25% decline compared to RM61.5 million in 
FY2023. Additionally, the division reached a significant 
milestone this year through a partnership with AME Elite 
Consortium Bhd, marking KLK Land’s inaugural venture 
into industrial property development. This collaboration 
represents a crucial step in KLK Land’s expansion 
strategy, helping to unlock the full potential of our  
property development portfolio in Peninsular Malaysia.
The Group’s Western Australian farms encompass 45,555 
hectares of arable land, dedicated to the cultivation of 
wheat, canola, barley and lupins. In FY2024, the segment 
experienced a challenging year, recording a loss of  
RM36.1 million, a significant decline from the previous 
year profit of RM29.2 million. This was primarily due to 
a sharp reduction in yields, driven by exceptionally dry 
conditions, with the driest weather on record affecting  
both the Chilimony and Erregulla farms, which together 
make up 45% of our arable land. These adverse conditions 
led to a 38% drop in revenue, while costs remained  
relatively persistent.
CORPORATE
In December 2023, KLK, through our subsidiary KLK 
Plantations and Trading Pte Ltd, acquired a 92% stake in 
PT Satu Sembilan Delapan (“SSD”) for RM262.7 million  
and a 90% stake in PT Tekukur Indah (“TKI”) for 
RM12.4 million, with a cumulative total planted area of  
approximately 6,400 hectares. These acquisitions were  
from a wholly owned subsidiary of Batu Kawan Bhd,  
our major shareholder. The acquisitions allowed the larger 
group to streamline and consolidate its plantation estates 
under KLK. Having managed the SSD and TKI estates  
since their commencement, this acquisition is expected  
to provide a reliable source of feedstock for KLK’s  
upcoming refinery and Oleochemical complex in East 
Kalimantan due to its proximity.
In the same financial year, KLK Land Sdn Bhd, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of KLK, acquired the remaining 40% 
stake in Aura Muhibah Sdn Bhd (“AMSB”) from UEM 
Sunrise Bhd for RM386.2 million. This acquisition gives 
KLK full ownership of AMSB, which holds 2,500 acres of 
land in Kulai, Johor, designated for property development. 
This transaction is expected to provide greater flexibility 
and control over future development plans for the land. 
The acquisition aligns with KLK’s strategy to enhance its 
property portfolio and capitalize on the potential of the 
Johor property market.
These strategic acquisitions underscore KLK’s commitment 
to expanding its operational footprint and enhancing its 
asset base, positioning the company for sustained growth 
and profitability in the coming years.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
SUSTAINABILITY
KLK remains fully committed to supporting the 
implementation of the European Union Deforestation 
Regulation (“EUDR”), recognising its role in advancing 
sustainability across the global supply chain. Our teams 
in Malaysia and Europe have worked diligently to ensure 
compliance, conducting trial shipments to test and refine 
our processes. We welcome the delay in enforcement 
and view this as an opportunity to further assess trial  
results, address gaps, reduce wastage and enhance 
efficiency, ensuring smooth operations when the  
regulation is fully enforced.
As an integrated oil palm player, we can leverage our 
strength in ensuring EUDR compliance, particularly in 
managing traceability and maintaining control over our 
supply chain. In addition to strengthening these internal 
capabilities, our sourcing team is also actively identifying 
additional EUDR-compliant feedstock suppliers. This 
dual approach—optimising our internal strengths while 
expanding our network of compliant partners—reinforces 
our commitment to sustainability.
KLK is also advancing its decarbonisation efforts in 
alignment with the global push to combat climate change.  
In FY2023, we introduced Seven Sustainability 
Commitments, including a target to reduce GHG emission 
intensity by 25% by FY2030 (compared to FY2019)  
and to achieve net-zero emissions by FY2050.  
The FY2019 baseline was chosen to reflect normal 
operations before COVID-19 disruptions, providing a 
consistent foundation for tracking progress.
This year, KLK achieved a 21% reduction in GHG  
emissions (Scope 1 and 2) compared to FY2019. We also 
expanded our reporting scope to include emissions from  
our Refinery and Kernel Crushing Plant operations,  
alongside ongoing energy and process efficiency 
improvements across mills, refineries, and oleochemical 
plants. Our renewable energy efforts include the Taiko  
Palm-Oleo Zhangjiagang solar rooftop project, which 
generates 3.25 million kWh annually and reduces  
2,206 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions.
Looking ahead, KLK will continue its decarbonisation  
efforts, aiming to increase solar energy capacity at our 
oleochemical plants and install more biogas plants by 
2030. These initiatives reflect our ongoing commitment 
to balancing operational growth with environmental 
responsibility.
Further details on our sustainability efforts are discussed  
in depth in the Sustainability Report section on page 52.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Plantation is KLK’s core business with 
a landbank of 355,165 hectares spread 
across Malaysia (Peninsular and Sabah), 
Indonesia (Sumatra, Belitung Island 
and Kalimantan) and Liberia. Out of the  
300,028 hectares of planted area,  
about 98% is planted with oil palm. 
Geographically, 57% of the oil palm  
planted area is in Indonesia, 41% in  
Malaysia and about 2% in Liberia. 
Meanwhile, rubber is planted only in 
Peninsular Malaysia and makes up the 
remaining 2% of planted area.
PLANTATION
Processing of fresh fruit bunches (“FFB”) is carried out at 34 of KLK’s  
own palm oil mills (“POMs”) of various capacities ranging from 20 mt/hour 
FFB to 120 mt/hour FFB (depending on size of the supplying estates).
Biogas power plant is another value-add improvement that the Plantation 
segment has invested in to reduce methane gas emissions. We currently 
have nine power generating biogas power plants in our POMs.

SEGMENTAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
PLANTATION SEGMENT
Our Plantation segment recorded a higher pre-tax profit of RM1.618 billion compared to RM1.164 billion in FY2023  
on the back of higher overall selling prices of CPO and PK. Particularly noteworthy was the average prices achieved  
for PK, which was significantly higher at RM2,115/mt compared to RM1,841/mt during the previous financial year.  
Overall average CPO price was also slightly higher at RM3,653/mt mainly boosted by contribution from better prices 
achieved for Indonesia sales, arising from the continued supply tightness as production there lagged. We observed that  
the average discount in Indonesia CPO prices had narrowed substantially during FY2024. Equally important, the Group  
also succeeded in pulling off a considerable reduction in its production cost.

Having seen prices fluctuating between RM3,500/mt to RM3,800/mt for most of FY2024, the market recently soared to  
a high of RM5,000/mt due to concerns that Indonesia CPO production could still chalk up a 2.0 million metric tonnes loss  
for full CY2024. There is an expectation of further tightening of supply as Indonesia goes ahead with its plan for B40  
biodiesel blending from January 2025 (just as the palm trees are entering their low production cycle), notwithstanding  
the very wide Palm Oil - Gas Oil (“POGO”) price spread, which determines the quantum of subsidies required to make 
blending viable.
The US soybean harvest is now complete with a high likelihood of achieving the forecasted production of 124.7 million 
tonnes. Favourable weather in Brazil and Argentina has raised soil moisture and brightened the prospects of their  
soybean plantings (production forecasted for the next harvest in April/May at 220 million tonnes combined). These large  
soybean crops have resulted in conflicting fundamentals to palm that is now reflected in significant price discounts of  
soy oil to palm oil. Soy oil prices have come under pressure due to a substantial rise in soybean supplies and increased 
crushing. At the same time palm is experiencing notable declines in production due to deteriorating age profile of  
oil palms while exports are curbed (due efforts to raise biodiesel blending targets in Indonesia). A recovery in palm  
production (particularly in Indonesia) in 2025 or any unexpected shifts in the development of South American soybean  
crop will have a significant impact on price movements going forward.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
OVERVIEW
In FY2024, KLK’s Plantation Division managed to achieve  
a modest increase in Fresh Fruit Bunch (“FFB”) production  
and yield, despite facing a complex array of external  
challenges. Our total FFB production in FY2024 reached  
5.47 million tonnes (FY2023: 5.25 million tonnes) and FFB 
yield stood at 20.6 mt/ha (FY2023: 20.5 mt/ha).
This modest increase highlights the incremental gains 
achieved through effective interventions in operational 
practices and the return of workforce stability, particularly 
in our Peninsular Malaysia estates, where a worker-to-
land ratio of 1:10 contributed significantly to production 
efficiency. The Central and Northern region (including  
Perak) saw significant gains, and our efforts to drive 
operational excellence through the replication of sound 
practices from high-yield potential estates proved  
beneficial. 
However, we faced yield declines in some areas. Sabah 
experienced an average yield reduction of 3% to 8% 
compared to FY2023, primarily due to pest-related 
challenges, severe poor pollination and huge dilution 
effect from substantial areas that came into maturity 
(approximately 3,981 hectares). In our Southern Indonesian 
estates where strong negative impacts of the 2023  
El Niño  was felt, yields declined the most; in particular  
in Lampung which saw a drop of up to 35%.  
Similarly, our operations in Liberia saw a 14% drop  
in yield, highlighting the need for ongoing adjustments  
to meet regional-specific challenges.
In our more challenging Kalimantan operations, particularly  
in the Berau region, more concerted efforts will continue  
to be implemented to improve crop recovery, water 
management and road accessibility. 
Our average Oil Extraction Rate (“OER”) improved  
marginally to 21.36% translating our Crude Palm  
Oil (“CPO”) yield to 4.41 mt/ha. However, in Indonesia, 
complexes such as PT Langkat Nusantara Kepong in  
North Sumatra and, PT Jabontara Eka Karsa and PT 
Putra Bongan Jaya, both in Kalimantan Timur achieved  
more than 6.0 mt/ha for CPO, further highlighting the  
efficacy of our targeted strategies. Collectively, these 
complexes cover more than 34,000 hectares.
While we saw marginal improvements in several key 
performance indicators, we remained slightly below our 
targets, underscoring the need for continued focus on 
operational efficiency and resilience. Continued emphasis  
on basic operational parameters and strengthening  
protocols for improved efficiency and yields whilst 
minimising impacts of weather, pest and disease and 
management oversight remains crucial. Nevertheless,  
the outcomes reflect the dedication and resilience of 
our teams, who continue to implement and refine best  
practices across our operations despite numerous biotic 
and abiotic challenges.

CHALLENGES AND RESPONSES
1. Extreme weather conditions
The Plantation Division encountered significant 
weather-related challenges in FY2024. The Nilo region 
in Riau faced unprecedented flooding, the worst 
recorded in 40 years, which lasted from January to 
March and affected a total area of approximately  
4,500 hectares. Of this, 575 hectares of mature  
palms were severely damaged and had to be.  
In immature areas, palms that had died were also 
resupplied. Our team on the ground carried out 
immediate post-flood rehabilitation works once the 
water subsided, including road repairs and improving 
access, clearing of all rotten bunches, collection of  
loose fruit, pruning, re-stacking of fronds and spraying 
of fungicides to manage disease risks. All rotten 
bunches were also extracted for kernel recovery.  
All post-flood rehabilitation work, including rebuilding 
of roads, repairing of drains and corrective fertiliser 
applications were completed by June 2024. These 
efforts have restored the affected areas and the 
recovery of our operations can be expected  
henceforth.
The impacts of the strong El Niño in 2023 continued 
to reverberate into 2024, particularly in regions  
south of the equator. Severe drought conditions 
south of Sumatera, particularly in Belitung, Sumatera 
Selatan, Lampung and southern regions of Kalimantan 
significantly impacted yields, underscoring the 
importance of climate resilience in our operations. 
Moving forward, we are preparing for potential  
La Niña  conditions in end 2024, with heightened 
alertness to the extraordinary wet weather expected 
in Northern Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and various 
regions in Indonesia.
To address these challenges, KLK has taken 
proactive steps to bolster resilience against such 
weather impacts. We have invested in robust water  
management systems, including the redesign of 
drainage systems in many of our operating centres 
and increased our investments in water-related 
infrastructures such as pumps, holding ponds, water 
gates and bunds. These enhancements are aimed 
at ensuring our estates are well-prepared to manage 
both flooding and drought, and efficiently using natural 
water resources to support optimal palm growth.
In addition to flood rehabilitation works, KLK also distributed food aid 
packages to approximately 1,800 individuals affected by the floods, 
including employees and neighbouring communities. The food aid 
distributed included rice, instant noodles, eggs and cooking oil
2. Pest management: Mealybugs, sooty mould and 
Ganoderma
Depressed yields in our Sabah regions in particular 
in Tawau were exacerbated by a persistent  
mealybug infestation, leading to severe outbreaks 
of sooty mould on palm canopies. The sooty mould 
significantly hindered photosynthesis, reducing 
sunlight interception by up to 78% and causing 
localised desiccation on affected leaves, which  
further compromised yields. 
In response, KLK, together with Applied Agricultural 
Resources Sdn Bhd (“AAR”) (KLK’s upstream R&D 
arm), conducted extensive research into this issue. 
Findings from AAR indicated a direct link between 
the proliferation of sooty mould and the outbreak of  
coconut mealybugs ( Nipaecoccus nipae ). Through 
collaborative efforts and support from the Malaysian 
Palm Oil Board (“MPOB”) and the Department of 
Agriculture (“DOA”), we pursued the registration 
of acephate as an effective treatment against  
mealybugs. Field treatments, including trunk injection 
and chemical spraying, have shown promising results, 
with up to 94% recovery in photosynthesis rates 
following treatment. This large-scale intervention, 
which commenced in FY2024, is now being rolled 
out across KLK’s estates in Sabah, notably in Tawau 
and Lahad Datu, where the impact has been most 
severe. Results have been shared with other industry 
members who have followed suit to curb the spread 
of mealybugs and sooty mould. KLK also extended 
assistance in terms of creating awareness, sharing  
and training other plantations as we believe collective 
effort is required to handle this out of ordinary pest 
situation. 
37
OUR ORGANISATION

---- Page 40 ----
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
Continuous treatment efforts and census collection 
will be carried out throughout FY2025 to monitor  
the progress of these interventions and evaluate  
their long-term effectiveness.
In addition to addressing the mealybug and sooty 
mould challenges, another critical issue continued 
to impact us was severe Ganoderma. Intervention 
measures taken during this period have shown  
positive results and the focus on improving Good 
Agricultural Practices (“GAP”), particularly in  
sanitation processes, will continue into FY2025 
and beyond. These sustained efforts aim to further  
mitigate the spread of Ganoderma and enhance  
overall disease control.
3. Ongoing challenges with pollination 
Poor pollination remains an ongoing challenge  
across several estates, impacting the quality and  
quantity of FFB harvested. Low fruit set, particularly  
in younger mature palms, has been linked to  
insufficient male inflorescence and pollinating  
weevils, compounded by extreme weather conditions 
in regions such as Sabah, Riau and Belitung.
To mitigate these pollination challenges, we 
implemented various strategies, including our 
Centralised Hatchery and Release (“CHR”) method 
of weevil rearing and release, assisted pollination 
and the introduction of palms with higher tendency 
of producing male inflorescence to support natural 
pollination. These efforts, initially piloted in FY2023, 
were expanded throughout FY2024, yielding positive 
early results. We have observed improved fruit 
set in several regions and we aim to build on this  
momentum by further strengthening our protocols to 
improve pollination and fruit set.
In the Lahad Datu region, the availability of a 
reliable pollen source and a sufficient workforce 
allows us to scale up assisted hand pollination. This 
labour-intensive process will be carried out across 
approximately 5,000 hectares, during the period  
from October 2024 to January 2025, when natural 
pollination is typically weaker due to the wet season. 
By aligning our efforts with this critical period, we aim 
to further optimise fruit set and improve overall yields.
KEY INITIATIVES
1. Replanting 
In FY2024, the Group replanted approximately 
9,200 hectares of oil palms, in comparison to the  
approximately 10,000 hectares replanted in FY2023. 
The primary focus was on areas that required  
replanting due to low yields caused mainly by low 
density of old palms. Significant efforts were directed 
towards replanting in Sugut (Sabah), Peninsular 
Malaysia as well as Belitung and South Sumatera, 
Indonesia as our replanting in Lahad Datu (Sabah)  
is reaching its tail-end. 
Replanting is a critical process that requires attention 
at every stage to ensure success. Quality replanting 
provides the foundation for future yields, and it is 
important that standards are consistently met. Careful 
planning is essential before land preparation begins, 
including determining the layout for infrastructure  
such as roads and drains. By addressing these early,  
we can avoid costly issues later. Proper land 
preparation, including chipping, pulverisation and 
deboling, is crucial for giving the new palms the  
best possible start and reduces the risk of diseases.
Such practices are continuously cascaded down 
to every operating centre in order to ensure our 
replant quality remains good in every planting. 
We also focus on the exchange of best practices 
and systematic approaches, ensuring consistency  
and quality across all operations. Each estate shares  
its successful replanting experiences, allowing the 
Group to improve practices, from nursery management 
to field preparation. This collaborative approach 
ensures that the palms are properly cared for from 
the outset, setting the stage for healthy growth and 
productive yields.
2. Progress in enhancing workers’ housing and  
well-being
At KLK, we recognise that our workers are our  
greatest asset. Our commitment to improving 
their living conditions remains a key priority as we  
continue to strive towards becoming the employer 
of choice within the industry. As part of our 
ongoing efforts to provide decent housing for our  
workforce, we have made significant progress with  
our three-year worker housing initiative, which  
involves upgrading and constructing new houses 
across various regions.
For FY2024, we are pleased to report continued 
progress in our worker housing programme.  
This year, we have invested RM34.8 million towards 
the housing initiative, upgrading and building a total 
of 800 units across our operations in Malaysia and 
Indonesia. In Peninsular Malaysia, all planned major 
and minor upgrading works have been completed,  
with 80 new units of workers’ housing in Johor  
expected to be fully completed by December 2024.

In line with our nine pillars for better worker retention 
in Indonesia, we have launched the Yayasan 
Sekolah SMP PWS – KLK junior high school at PT 
Pinang Witmas Sejati in South Sumatra. This school  
provides educational opportunities for the children  
of our workers, particularly those aged 13 to  
16 years old. In Mandau, an additional Senior High 
School – SMA Swasta KLK Mandau catering for 
90 students was also launched in June this year,  
further supporting the educational needs of our 
employees’ families.
These initiatives are an integral part of our efforts  
to create a better living environment for our  
employees, supporting their well-being and  
contributing to a more stable and positive work 
experience in the plantation sector.

3. Advancing mechanisation across operations
In FY2024, we continued our mechanisation efforts 
with initiatives aimed at improving productivity 
and optimising labour across our estates. After  
introducing the Verion Smart Fertiliser Spreader in 
Indonesia, we expanded its use to additional estates, 
including those in Kalimantan, with further sites 
planned for FY2025. Next year, we will also introduce 
an enhanced version of the Verion, featuring a  
lighter polyethylene hopper and increased capacity. 
This advancement will not only improve efficiency  
by reducing the overall weight of the spreader but  
also increase its fertiliser capacity, allowing for more 
efficient fertiliser distribution across larger areas. 
Additionally, the new version will be significantly  
lower in cost to produce, making it a more  
cost-effective solution. The enhanced model will  
first be introduced in Sabah and later in Indonesia 
(Kalimantan and Sumatra).
Additionally, approximately 430 additional units, 
involving both major and minor upgrading works,  
are targeted for completion in FY2025.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Group’s Research & Development (“R&D”) plays a crucial role in driving ongoing improvements in  
agricultural practices, planting materials, and the optimisation of agro-management inputs. These R&D activities are 
conducted through AAR, an associate company of KLK. In Indonesia, PT Applied Agricultural Resources Indonesia (“AARI”), 
a wholly owned subsidiary of KLK, performs a similar role to AAR, supporting our operations regionally.
Here are the highlights of R&D for FY2024:
1. Evaluating the Potential of Biofertilisers for Sustainable Oil Palm Growth
This year, we launched a semi-commercial biofertiliser evaluation trial aimed at assessing biofertilisers’ potential 
to support oil palm growth with a 25% potential reduction in inorganic fertiliser input. Four commercially available 
biofertilisers were selected and tested across approximately 1,501 hectares of immature, young mature, and  
mature fields in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah. By substituting a portion of inorganic fertiliser, this initiative  
supports our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, with an estimated carbon reduction of  
731.35 kgCO 2e if successful. The trial will continue to be monitored over the next five years to gather insights on  
the long-term impact of biofertiliser use on crop performance and environmental benefits.
At present, 66% of our planted area are in the favorable age profile with young and prime palms (ranging between 4 and  
18 years), in particular in our Indonesia estates. The immature palm trees area has dropped from 10% to 9% in FY2024.

We are also shifting from internal combustion engine-powered units to battery-powered Mechanical Buffalo  
and Power Barrow to optimise maintenance efficiency and costs. We continue to expand the use of mini tractors 
in various parts of Indonesia including in our more recent acquisitions in South Sumatera and Kalimantan to further 
improve FFB evacuation. Similarly, we also continue to push towards mechanising our crop evacuation processes  
even in more challenging terrain (hilly areas) and soil conditions (soft ground). Trials of suitable machinery are  
underway to further minimise double handling, streamlining operations and saving time.
Together, these initiatives complemented with more extensive use of lighter carbon graphite harvesting poles,  
reflect our integrated approach to mechanisation, promoting more worker friendly procedures, driving resource 
optimisation and increasing productivity across our operations.

2. Advancing fertiliser reduction through Microbial 
Inoculation
To further our sustainability goals, the inoculation of  
AA N-Fix, an in-house microbial product, was 
implemented across 12 estates in Peninsular  
Malaysia, with 67,978 DxP seeds inoculated as of 
FY2024. Preliminary results from nursery trials show 
that AA N-Fix supports healthy seedling growth, 
with responses showing marginal improvement or 
on par with control groups, indicating its potential to 
reduce reliance on inorganic fertilisers. Improvements 
in application methods, such as soil drenching,  
have simplified the process for estate workers.  
By December 2024, we aim to inoculate a total 
of 72,400 DxP seeds, and field trials in 2025 will  
evaluate AA N-Fix’s effectiveness in supporting 
reduced fertiliser use while maintaining or enhancing 
growth and yield.
This variety, developed from long-stalk Deli dura  
and Yangambi pisifera, combines high yield potential 
and an enhanced Oil-to-Bunch Ratio with a distinctive 
long stalk that eases harvesting and allows for frond 
retention. The long-stalk feature also supports better 
airflow around bunches, improving pollination and 
fruit set, which contribute to higher yields. This 
development highlights our ongoing commitment  
to support productivity improvements and innovation 
in sustainable agriculture.

3. Efficient weed management
KLK OLEO has developed an innovative adjuvant  
aimed at enhancing herbicide effectiveness for weed 
control in oil palm plantations. Following successful 
validation in laboratory and field trials at Tuan Mee 
Estate, the adjuvant has shown comparable efficacy 
to existing commercial products but at a lower cost. 
Currently, this is being implemented across our  
estates in Malaysia. The rollout of this product  
across KLK estates marks a practical step in  
managing input costs and supporting efficient weed 
control operations.
4.  Certificate of Registration of New Plant Variety  
and Breeder’s Rights: AA Hybrida LS
In a significant achievement for our breeding 
programme, AA Hybrida LS, a new long-stalk DxP 
oil palm variety, has been granted registration under 
Malaysia’s Protection of New Plant Varieties Act. 
CONCLUSION
In summary, FY2024 was a year of growth and learning 
for the Plantation Division. While we achieved marginal 
improvements in production and yield, we also recognise 
the work that lies ahead to fully meet our ambitious 
targets. The year has reinforced the importance of robust 
operational practices, climate resilience, and strategic 
pest management as we navigate an increasingly complex 
operating environment.
Moving forward, we will place greater emphasis on 
enhancing land and labour productivity, optimising our 
workforce, and reducing reliance on foreign labour.  
This will involve improving the labour ratio and  
accelerating our mechanisation efforts to optimise 
operations, mitigate cost pressures and ensure long-term 
sustainability. We will also continue to review, update and 
strengthen existing standard operating procedures by 
incorporating new methodologies using science-based, 
data driven initiatives to enhance effectiveness.
As we acknowledge our achievements, we remain  
mindful of the need to continue to maintain and enhance  
the best practices that underpin our success, and to  
continually address areas where challenges remain.  
Looking forward, our commitment to operational  
excellence, sustainable growth and a back-to-basics 
approach will guide us as we strive to overcome  
obstacles and unlock new growth opportunities in FY2025 
and beyond.

MANUFACTURING
KLK OLEO saw a strong recovery in FY2024. This positive 
growth was driven by stronger performances in Malaysia 
and Europe, supported by increased capacity at key sites, 
successful implementation of strategic initiatives and 
favourable market conditions in sectors such as food and 
personal care. This recovery aligns with broader global 
market trends, where there has been a steady rebound in 
demand for biodegradable products and a shift towards 
more sustainable solutions, factors that have benefited 
KLK’s operations. 
Overall market condition for Oleochemical improved in 
comparison to FY2023. However, challenges persist in 
China, where the economic recovery has been slower than 
expected, particularly in the construction sector, which 
continues to affect demand for industrial chemicals. While 
we remain hopeful, the recovery is expected to be gradual. 
We are addressing these challenges by focusing on sales 
strategies and adapting to evolving market conditions,  
with a strong emphasis on high-demand sectors 
such as home and personal care, food and feed and  
pharmaceuticals.

---- Page 47 ----
MALAYSIA
In FY2024, Oleochemical segment performed well, 
benefitting from steady demand for fatty acids,  
glycerine and esters. However, challenges persisted in 
the construction-related products, driven by a slow down 
in property and infrastructure investments. This has also 
led to weak demand for industrial products. In spite of the 
challenges, the overall performance in Malaysia remained 
strong, benefiting from its diverse product portfolio, 
supported by robust performance in other key segments. 
Our continued focus on cost optimisation and operational 
excellent has enabled us to remain competitive amidst 
rising input costs.
CHINA
In China, we continued to face significant challenges.  
The slow recovery in the construction and industrial 
chemicals sectors is a reflection of broader macroeconomic 
difficulties in the country, including weak domestic  
demand and ongoing supply chain disruptions. The 
country’s recovery from COVID-19 has been uneven and 
growth in key sectors has been slower than anticipated.
With the stimulus measures introduced by the Chinese 
government, market sentiment in China has shown 
some improvement. However, we do not anticipate a  
substantial recovery in the near term. We remain optimistic 
about China’s long-term prospects. Our investment in  
new facilities in China is expected to be fully operational  
by the middle of FY2025, contributing positively to the 
bottom line. Additionally, the ongoing shift towards 
sustainable products presents a significant opportunity  
for KLK to strengthen its position in the country.
EUROPE
Europe has seen a gradual recovery, supported by strategic 
restructuring initiatives. The closure of Düsseldorf fatty 
acid plant, and the shift towards specialty products have 
positioned KLK’s Emmerich and Kolb facilities for growth 
in the pharmaceutical and personal care sectors. These 
segments are expected to deliver higher margins, in line 
with global market trends where demand for high-quality,  
sustainable ingredients is rising, particularly in the  
cosmetics and healthcare sectors. New investment in 
polymerised fatty acid facility was completed in end 
of FY2024. The new product portfolio is expected to  
contribute positively to coming years financial result.
As part of our transformation, KLK has made progress in 
aligning its operations—from plantation and refinery to 
oleochemicals—with the European Union Deforestation 
Regulation (“EUDR”), strengthening sourcing and 
segregation strategies to ensure compliance. This is in 
line with broader regulatory trends across Europe, where 
companies are increasingly expected to source raw  
materials responsibly and sustainably. With the  
sustainability efforts invested in over the years, we are in 
a good position to meet these regulatory requirements. 
Although the EU has decided to delay the EUDR by  
12 months, KLK will continue to work towards ensuring 
compliance across our supply chain.
OUTLOOK
Looking ahead to FY2025, we remain cautiously optimistic, 
supported by better performance in FY2024 and  
continued expansion of capacities. We are focusing 
on high-growth markets such as India, the U.S.A., and  
potentially South America, where demand for 
sustainable products continues to rise in line with global  
macroeconomic trends towards green and bio-based 
chemicals.
We are also mindful of the fierce competition that will 
accompany our global expansions, as new capacity comes 
online in key markets. Nevertheless, we are committed 
to diversifying our product offerings and capturing new 
opportunities to stay ahead of the competition. We 
will continue to focus on transforming and improving 
performance of business units that perform below 
expectations.
With our investments in expansions during FY2024  
coming online in FY2025, we are well-positioned to  
support capacity growth and meet the rising demand, 
ensuring we can fulfil the needs of the markets we serve.

In FY2024, the Refinery Division faced significant  
challenges, including adverse margins caused by 
overcapacity in the refining industry and the unexpected 
strengthening of CPO prices. Refining margins in 
Indonesia were particularly squeezed due to industry-wide 
excess capacity and a shortfall in local CPO production. 
Compounding these challenges was palm oil’s reduced 
competitiveness in price-sensitive markets, where its 
premium over soybean oil affected demand. However,  
the kernel crushing segment benefitted from strong  
demand, driven by Europe’s stocking-up activities ahead  
of the now-delayed implementation of the EUDR.
In addition to these external factors, operational costs, 
primarily from pre-commissioning activities at our  
integrated site in Kalimantan and within the Specialty 
Oils and Fats business, also weighed on performance.  
These losses are expected to decline in FY2025 as  
product qualification processes are refined and plant 
commissioning progresses towards full operations, 
expected to come on stream in 2025.

The Group’s mainstay refinery, Kernel Crushing Plant and 
Power Plant project in East Kalimantan, PT Perindustrian 
Sawit Synergi, are in the final stages of commissioning 
and expected to be fully completed by Q2FY2025.  
We are pleased to report that the first shipment of  
RBD Palm Olein was successfully shipped out from  
the jetty in October 2024.
In line with the Refinery Division’s foray into the  
specialty oils and fats space, we are establishing a Food 
Application and Development Centre (“FADC”) at Bukit 
Raja, Klang. When completed in Q2FY2026, the FADC  
will be a centre of excellence in culinary oils & fats,  
bakery and pastry as well as chocolate and confectionery.

In FY2024, the global rubber products market showed  
signs of stabilisation, with consistent demand for  
disposable gloves and growing interest in reusable 
alternatives. Malaysian manufacturers, including  
KL-Kepong Rubber Products (“KLKRP”), benefited from  
US tariffs on Chinese-made gloves. Despite facing  
challenges such as aggressive pricing from Chinese 
competitors and rising input costs, stabilising Average 
Selling Prices and improved utilisation rates in the latter 
half of the year helped to create a more favourable  
market environment.
KLKRP has commissioned its new disposable gloves  
plant in Ipoh, Perak. In December 2023, all eight  
production lines were fully operational. This milestone 
marked a shift for KLKRP from its traditional focus on 
reusable gloves, as it diversified its product offerings to 
include disposable gloves, primarily serving the medical 
and food processing industries, better catering to  
the demands of global markets, particularly in the U.S.A.  
and Europe.
NON-OLEOCHEMICAL
As part of this diversification and in line with the company’s 
long-term strategy, sustainability remained a core focus, 
with KLKRP integrating a 6.5MW cogeneration system 
and a 20TPH biomass boiler to enhance energy efficiency, 
reduce emissions, and strengthen its ESG position.
However, the commissioning of the new disposable glove 
plant has not been without challenges, resulting in some 
operational losses. Steps have been taken to address these 
issues, including targeted programmes to reduce off-spec/
off-grade production and improve line speeds, which are 
expected to help mitigate these losses and enhance overall 
efficiency. 
Looking ahead, KLKRP plans to stabilise its production  
in FY2025 to support the growing demand for its  
products and enhance its competitive position in the  
market.

PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT
MARKET OVERVIEW
Malaysia’s property market is experiencing 
steady growth in 2024, supported by 
various government initiatives under the 
MADANI Budget. Property transactions 
and values have surged, with RM105.65 
billion recorded in the first half of the year, 
a 24% year-on-year increase. Key sectors, 
including residential, commercial, and 
industrial, have shown robust performance, 
driven by strategic investments and 
infrastructure projects. The market’s 
resilience is further reinforced by three key 
drivers: robust economic growth of 6% in 
the first half of 2024, a RM10.000 billion 
Housing Credit Guarantee Scheme for 
first-time homebuyers, and the maintenance of the overnight policy rate at  
3% alongside the extension of stamp duty exemptions for first-time 
homebuyers. Despite challenges such as inflation, high-interest rates,  
and overhang units in some areas, the overall market outlook remains 
positive, bolstered by government support and favourable economic 
conditions.
PERFORMANCE
For FY2024, KLK Land managed to record RM229.4 million in revenue, 
which is 5% higher than the previous financial year (FY2023: RM218.1 
million). The increase in revenue is mainly attributable to encouraging  
sales in Caledonia, Ijok, i.e., the mid-market Ayana terrace houses 
and Caledonia Avenue shops. However, pre-tax profit decreased to 
RM46.4 million, a 25% decline compared to FY2023 of RM61.5 million.  
This decrease in pre-tax profit is primarily influenced by shifts in the  
product mix and changes in sales performance across certain categories.

Jardin 2 Residences
BANDAR SERI COALFIELDS
In FY2024, Bandar Seri Coalfields  
achieved significant milestones, beginning 
with the completion of key upgrades to 
Central Park and the BSC Football Hub. 
The opening of BSC Football Hub has 
further enhanced the vibrancy at the BSC 
Central Shoplots, with several new outlets, 
including popular home cafés, opening 
within just one month of its launch.
On the construction front, Jardin 2 
and Quinton 1 are progressing well, 
both of which are set to be delivered in  
Q2FY2025 and Q4FY2025, respectively. 
The Coalfields Retail Mall is also moving 
forward, with 40% of the project completed. 
Set to become the primary commercial 
hub in Bandar Seri Coalfields, the mall 
will offer a net lettable area (“NLA”) of  
337,181 square feet and include an 
entertainment hub, cinema, ice-skating rink, a wide range of F&B outlets, 
and key tenants such as a supermarket and gymnasium. The main mall 
together with its drive through outlets is expected to be completed by  
Q2FY2026, positioning the mall as a catalyst for future growth and  
vibrancy in the township.
Looking ahead to FY2025, exciting launches have been planned with 
two new developments set to be introduced. These include Walden 2,  
offering double-storey and single-storey bungalows with lake frontage  
and Quinton 2, a collection of superlink (24x80 feet) houses.
In addition to these main projects, we are also expanding the township’s 
recreational and work-life balance offerings. The introduction of  
V-Ride, an E-bike and electric scooter rental service, alongside with 
other sports activities will diversify the recreational options available to  
residents, while a new co-working space in the BSC Central 1 Shops will 
cater to the growing demand for flexible workspaces at the township. 
These developments are designed to create a more dynamic and  
integrated living environment, ensuring that Bandar Seri Coalfields  
continues to be a desirable place to call home to our future prospects.

CALEDONIA, IJOK
Caledonia has reached a significant 
milestone with the delivery of vacant 
possession for Ayana 1 terrace houses,  
with 50% of homeowners having 
collected their keys and moved into their 
new homes as of September 2024. The 
launch of Kamelia terrace units, initially 
set for Q2FY2024, has been deferred to 
Q1FY2025. This will also optimise the 
pricing strategy in tandem with the rate  
of demand. Kamelia 1 will feature 238 
double-storey terrace homes, with a  
built-up area of 1,705 square feet, catering 
to buyers in the RM596,000 to RM950,000 
range. Following the successful launch  
of Iris 1, consisting of 154 Rumah 
Selangorku terrace houses, Iris 2 and  
3 will be launched in FY2026 to meet 
ongoing demand for Rumah Selangorku 
units.

CONCLUSION 
In the coming year, with the continued development of key amenities and infrastructure, we expect sales in both  
Bandar Seri Coalfields and Caledonia to grow steadily. The completion of major projects like the Coalfields Retail 
Park, V-Ride and the Perodua 3S service centre, coupled with the launch of new residential phases such as Quinton 2,  
Walden 2 and Kamelia 1 will further enhance the appeal and growth of both townships. These developments, along with  
the strategic introduction of recreational and commercial offerings, are expected to attract more buyers, ensuring stable  
sales growth while further solidifying the townships as desirable living destinations.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE
To ensure the integrity and reliability of the data and 
information presented in this report, we engaged Control 
Union Certifications (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (“CU”) as an 
independent third-party assurance provider to conduct  
an external verification of our sustainability disclosures.  
The assurance process included a thorough review of our 
KLK is fully committed to support the European 
Union Deforestation Regulation (“EUDR”). Although 
the implementation of the EUDR has been delayed,  
we continue to prepare diligently to meet its  
requirements. This delay provides us additional time 
to further align our operations with the expectations of 
our European customers. We remain steadfast in our 
commitment to sustainable land use and the protection 
of the environment. By ensuring compliance, we hope 
to set an example of responsible resource stewardship 
while contributing to a sustainable future for all.
In the realm of human rights, our work continues 
to advance. We have completed an independent  
assessment of our practices in Peninsular Malaysia, 
ensuring that our operations are conducted in line with 
globally recognised ethical standards. Furthermore,  
we have strengthened our recruitment practices,  
ensuring, to the best of our ability, that zero recruitment 
costs are incurred by our workers, extending our 
commitment to fair labour practices from source  
countries to our operations.
Disclosure is an ongoing journey for KLK. This year,  
we have moved closer to fulfill the full requirements of 
the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(“TCFD”). We remain committed to meet Bursa  
Malaysia’s standards and are actively working 
towards compliance with the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), the European standard 
for sustainability disclosure and Malaysia’s National 
Sustainability Reporting Framework (“NSRF”) which 
covers both International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) S1 and S2. 
As part of our unwavering commitment to sustainability,  
KLK has made significant strides in reducing our 
carbon footprint. In 2024, we implemented a series of 
initiatives aimed at enhancing energy efficiency, adopting 
renewable energy sources and optimising our resource 
utilisation across all operations. These efforts are  
aligned with our long-term goal of achieving net-zero 
emissions, contributing to the global fight against 
climate change. By continually refining our practices and  
investing in innovative technologies, we are not only 
reducing our environmental impact but also setting a 
standard for responsible resource stewardship in the 
palm oil industry.
Guided by our strategic focus, sustainability informs  
our decisions and actions at every level. We will not lose 
sight of its importance as we drive our business forward.
This year’s report reflects our continued efforts and  
dedication to enhance sustainability practices,  
demonstrate our commitment to transparency, 
accountability and continuous improvement in all that  
we do.

KLK’s five-tier sustainability governance and implementation 
structure offers a comprehensive mechanism to effectively 
manage the integration of sustainability into the organisation. 
The Board of Directors oversees the sustainability and 
climate-related strategy, ensuring that sustainability and 
climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated 
into KLK’s long-term planning. The Board establishes the 
strategic direction, vision and core values while ensuring 
that business operations are aligned with sustainability 
goals and the expectations of stakeholders.
The Board is assisted in this function by the Audit and 
Risk Committee (“ARC”), which is formed by a majority 
of non-executive directors and is chaired by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director. This setup ensures  
a high level of neutrality and independence in the governance 
and oversight of climate-related and sustainability matters 
brought to it by the Sustainability Steering Committee 
(“SSC”) for deliberation.
The SSC, led by the Executive Chairman and supported  
by the Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), monitors, guides,  
and approves major policies, processes, and strategies  
related to environmental, social, governance, and 
reputational  risks. The SSC ensures that sustainability 
and climate-related initiatives are integrated into  
decision-making processes, along with the provision of 
necessary resources to support them. The SSC delegates 
specific implementation plans to the Sustainability 
Working Committee (“SWC”) which is headed by the  
Chief Sustainability Officer.
The SWC executes sustainability and climate-related risk 
mitigation and opportunities efforts across all operational 
levels. It ensures sustainable practices and compliance 
are integrated into each operating unit and reviews and 
recommends changes to policies and sustainability 
practices. The SWC provides guidance and updates to  
the SSC accordingly.
Sustainability Task Forces are established as needed, 
either within specific business units or across multiple 
units, bringing together subject matter experts  
from within KLK. These teams are tasked with developing 
and implementing initiatives to address emerging 
challenges and opportunities. For instance, in preparation 
for EUDR compliance, a dedicated task force was  
formed to align efforts across both our Plantation and 
Manufacturing sectors. Additionally, our decarbonisation 
task force for Oleochemical operating in Europe and  
Asia, remains focused on reducing our emissions.
Climate Governance and TCFD Alignment
KLK’s approach to climate governance is closely aligned 
with the TCFD’s recommendations, ensuring that  
climate-related risks and opportunities are fully integrated 
into our corporate governance framework.
Board Oversight
The Board, regularly reviews climate-related risks and 
opportunities, integrating them into strategic decisions. 
This ensures that climate considerations are embedded  
in the company’s long-term objectives and that 
governance structures are responsive to evolving 
climate-related challenges.
Risk Management
The Audit and Risk Committee oversees the  
identification, assessment, and management of  
climate-related risks, ensuring they are addressed

3. Climate Risk Management
 KLK’s approach to climate risk management is multifaceted, addressing both physical and transition risks in alignment 
with TCFD recommendations.
 Physical Risks
4. Continuous Monitoring, Reporting, and Improvement
 KLK integrates sustainability and climate-related risks into our overall risk management framework, ensuring that  
these risks are considered in all major business decisions. This includes practical measures to mitigate such risks,  
such as the installation of solar rooftops, energy efficiency, decarbonisation activities, and other initiatives, which are 
further detailed in subsequent sections of the report.
 In line with TCFD recommendations, we disclose our risk management processes, the risks we identify, and the  
strategies we use to mitigate them, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of how we manage and  
mitigate risks. The GRMC and ARC regularly review risk management reports to ensure that all risks, especially  
climate-related ones, are addressed comprehensively and proactively.
 For more information on our top priority risks and management strategies, please refer to the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control on pages 135 -139.
CLIMATE STRATEGY
KLK understands the significant impact of climate change on our business and communities. Our climate strategy, aligned 
with TCFD recommendations, addresses these challenges and ensures resilience. This strategy is part of our broader 
sustainability framework.
For FY2024, we updated our climate risks and opportunities through a three-step approach. First, we mapped them  
against global climate standards, including TCFD. Next, we evaluated national and regional policies where we operate.  
Finally, we considered industry peers’ risks and opportunities.
We conducted a materiality assessment to validate these risks and opportunities, considering factors at both the country 
level and for all business units. The impact assessments identified potential operational and financial effects, forming the 
foundation for future quantitative scenario analysis.
 Transition Risks
Overview
Physical risks include the direct impacts of climate 
change on our operations, such as extreme weather 
events, changes in precipitation patterns, and rising 
temperatures. These risks are particularly relevant to 
our Plantation and Manufacturing segments.
Overview
Transition risks arise from the global shift towards  
a low-carbon economy, including regulatory changes, 
shifts in market preferences, and technological 
advancements. These risks can affect KLK’s 
compliance costs, market position, and operational 
efficiency.
Management Strategy
KLK employs scenario analysis to assess the  
potential impact of physical risks, guiding the 
development of our resilience-building strategies. 
These include investments in climate-resilient 
infrastructure and renewable energy.
Management Strategy
KLK closely monitors developments in climate 
regulations and market trends to stay ahead of 
transition risks. This includes adhering to regulations 
such as the EUDR and investing in sustainable 
technologies that reduce our carbon footprint and 
enhance our competitive advantage.

While we did not conduct a new assessment this year, there 
were some rationale changes from last year’s matrix. 
1. Combining material topics of similar nature and efforts:
	 •	 ‘Carbon Emissions Reduction’ and ‘Net Zero’ into 
a Single Material Issue
In our ongoing effort to streamline our sustainability 
focus, KLK has decided to combine ‘Carbon 
Emissions	Reduction’	and	‘Net	Zero’	into	a	single	
material issue. These two matters are deeply 
interconnected, as the pathway to achieve net zero 
emission is inherently dependent on our ability to 
reduce carbon emissions across our operations.  
By integrating these matters, KLK is able to take 
a more cohesive and comprehensive approach 
to manage our climate-related goals, aligning 
our strategies more effectively with international 
standards and best practices.
	 •	 ‘Protection of High Carbon Stock Forest’ and 
‘Management of Peatlands’
After careful consideration, KLK has merged 
‘Protection	of	High	Carbon	Stock	(“HCS”)	Forest’	
and ‘Management of Peatlands’ into one material 
topic. Both are key components of KLK’s broader 
strategy to preserve ecosystems with high carbon 
value. The management of peatlands and protection 
of	HCS	forests	require	similar	approaches	in	terms	
of monitoring, conservation, and engagement with 
local communities. Combining these topics allows 
us to better align our actions and reporting, ensuring 
a unified strategy for managing high-risk areas while 
streamlining our sustainability efforts.
2. Removal of material topics from the matrix, based on 
the following considerations:
	 •	 Regenerative Agriculture
While regenerative agriculture remains a valuable 
approach, it is sufficiently addressed within our 
broader environmental management practices, 
particularly through our Good Agriculture Practices 
on oil palm plantations as inherently support 
regenerative principles, we have opted to consolidate 
our efforts rather than treat regenerative agriculture 
as a separate material issue.
	 •	 Market and Commodity Price Risk Management
Given its integral role in our overall business risk 
management, ‘Market and Commodity Price Risk 
Management’ is governed under our financial and 
operational risk frameworks. Since this issue is 
directly tied to our core business operations rather 
than sustainability-specific initiatives, we have 
chosen to focus our materiality assessment on 
issues more directly related to sustainability.
 •	Legal Compliance
Legal compliance is foundational to all aspects 
of KLK’s operations and is embedded into every 
activity we undertake. As it is a prerequisite for all  
our business practices, it is managed as a 
fundamental principle rather than as a distinct 
material issue, ensuring that all KLK activities  
adhere to applicable laws and regulations.
Influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions
67
OUR ORGANISATION

---- Page 70 ----
	 •	 Grievance Redressal
This decision was made to eliminate redundancy, 
as comprehensive details regarding our grievance 
mechanisms are already covered under the 
Evaluation of Suppliers’/Contractors’ Sustainability 
Commitment within the Marketplace pillar. This 
approach allows us to maintain focus in each  
section on unique aspects of our sustainability 
practices without diluting the attention on other 
critical areas. By centralising the discussion of 
grievance redressal, we enhance the coherence 
of our reporting and ensure that stakeholders can 
easily find and understand our policies and their 
implementation across all related areas.
	 •	 Living Wage
While KLK is committed to ensuring fair and  
equitable wages across its operations, the decision 
to remove ‘Living Wage’ as a standalone material 
issue is driven by the fact that it is part of our overall 
labour practices. The principles of fair remuneration 
are embedded in our broader employee welfare, 
human rights, and labour relations frameworks, 
all of which are rigorously managed under KLK’s 
sustainability commitments. Moreover, the ‘Living 
Wage’ issue is fully addressed within our compliance 
with national standards and our commitment to 
uphold worker rights.
	 •	 Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (“FPIC”)
KLK is fully committed to uphold the principles 
of FPIC as part of our broader sustainability 
commitments. As a member of the Roundtable 
on Sustainable Palm Oil (“RSPO”), KLK adheres 
to the RSPO’s Principles & Criteria, which include  
the requirement to respect FPIC rights, particularly  
in matters related to land acquisition and 
development. We maintain rigorous adherence 
to these principles across all our operations and 
ensure	that	they	are	consistently	applied.	However,	
given that FPIC is an embedded requirement of  
our RSPO certification process rather than a 
standalone initiative, we have chosen not to present 
it separately within the Community pillar this year. 
Our approach is in line with industry peers who also 
integrate FPIC requirements under their broader 
compliance frameworks rather than highlighting  
it as an independent material topic.
Moving forward, KLK will continue to focus on 
transparent stakeholder engagement, community 
development, and responsible practices that align 
with RSPO standards. Any development or concern 
regarding FPIC will be communicated within the 
context of our adherence to RSPO certification, 
where they are regularly monitored and audited by 
independent third party assessors.
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
•	Measures	
 KLK employs a range of measures to address these 
material issues, such as adopting best practices 
in sustainable agriculture, enhancing supply chain 
transparency, and investing in employee health and  
safety programmes.
•	Indicators
 To track our performance, KLK uses a variety of 
indicators, including carbon intensity metrics, hectarage 
of conservation area, percentage of RSPO certification, 
and employee training hours. These indicators help us 
monitor progress and make data-driven decisions to 
continuously improve our sustainability efforts.
MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL ISSUES
KLK’s approach to managing material sustainability issues 
involves a set of policies, measures, and performance 
indicators. Each material issue identified in the matrix is 
linked to specific management strategies that align with 
KLK’s overall sustainability framework.
•	Policies
 Each material issue is governed by specific policies that 
guide KLK’s actions. For example, our Environmental 
Policy drives our efforts in managing issues such as

TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL 
DISCLOSURES (“TCFD”)
KLK recognises the critical importance of addressing 
climate-related risks and opportunities as part of our 
broader sustainability strategy. In alignment with the 
recommendations of the TCFD, we have integrated 
climate considerations into our governance, strategy, risk 
management, and performance metrics. This section 
provides a comprehensive overview of how we adhere to 
TCFD principles across our operations.
1. Governance

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
At KLK, we recognise the critical role that sustainability 
plays in the marketplace, encompassing transparency, 
ethical conduct, and responsible sourcing. Guided by 
our sustainability framework, we are committed to drive  
positive environmental, social, and economic outcomes 
throughout our value chain. This section outlines how we 
manage key aspects such as product certification, ethical 
practices, supplier sustainability, and traceability.
MARKETPLACE
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Upholding high standards of sustainability certification is 
vital for KLK as it reflects our commitment to responsible 
practices and enhances our credibility in the global 
market. For our plantation operations, certifications such 
as RSPO, Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (“MSPO”), 
Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (“ISPO”), and International 
Sustainability & Carbon Certification (“ISCC”) ensure that 
our palm oil production meets stringent environmental, 
social, and governance standards. This not only enables us 
to comply with regulatory requirements but also supports 
market access, meets customer expectations, and aligns 
with global efforts to mitigate climate change, prevent 
deforestation, and protect biodiversity.
For our oleochemical manufacturing, pursuing relevant 
certifications is equally critical. These certifications help 
us benchmark against industry best practices, ensure 
compliance with international standards, and demonstrate 
our dedication to sustainable and efficient production 
processes. Together, these efforts across our Plantations 
and Manufacturing operations bolster KLK’s reputation as 
a responsible producer in the industry.
OUR APPROACH
•	RSPO Certification
KLK adheres to RSPO standards, which encompass 
stringent criteria for no deforestation, new peat 
development and exploitation (“NDPE”) policies. This 
ensures that our palm oil products are responsibly 
sourced and traceable throughout the supply chain.
•	MSPO Certification
As a Malaysian-based company, KLK complies with 
the MSPO certification, which mandates sustainable 
management practices, legal compliance, and  
continuous improvement in plantation management.
•	ISPO Certification
For our operations in Indonesia, KLK meets the  
ISPO certification requirements, focusing on legal, 
environmental, social, and economic aspects to promote 
sustainable palm oil production in the country.

•	ISCC Certification
To meet the demands of the European market and other global customers, KLK is also certified under the ISCC.  
This certification ensures that our products adhere to sustainability criteria, greenhouse gas reduction, and  
traceability requirements.
•	Manufacturing Plant Certification
KLK’s	oleochemical	 plants	 in	 Asia	 and	 Europe	 maintain	 certifications 	 such	 as	 ISO	 9001	 (Quality	 Management),	 
ISO	14001	(Environmental	Management),	and	ISO	45001	(Health	and	Safety).	These	certifications	ensure	our	products	 
meet international standards and align with best practices in quality, safety, and sustainability.
For our plantations, the acquisition of IJM Plantations temporarily reduced our overall RSPO certification percentage  
in FY2022 due to the need to certify newly acquired estates and mills. Nonetheless, we have not halted our efforts and  
have made progress by securing RSPO certifications for additional estates and mills in both Indonesia and Malaysia  
this financial year. This year, we have obtained RSPO certification for Desa Talisai POM cluster and PT Prima Alumga  
Estate. We aim to complete the certification of our remaining assets in Malaysia by the end of 2024, in Indonesia by  
Q4	2025,	and	in	Liberia	by	the	end	of	2025.

in our data management systems.
ETHICAL PRACTICE
73
OUR ORGANISATION

---- Page 76 ----
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
KLK recognises that its commitment to sustainability 
extends beyond its direct operations to include its entire 
supply chain. Suppliers and contractors play a critical role  
in achieving sustainable palm oil production and  
oleochemical manufacturing. Ensuring that suppliers and 
contractors adhere to KLK’s sustainability standards, 
including ethical practices, labour rights, environmental 
protection, and anti-corruption measures, is vital for 
mitigating risks, upholding stakeholder trust, and  
maintaining compliance with global sustainability 
certifications and regulations, such as RSPO, MSPO,  
ISPO, ISCC and soon EUDR.
OUR APPROACH
•	Zero Tolerance for Child Labour, Forced Labour, and 
Human Trafficking
KLK maintains a firm stance against child labour,  
forced labour, and human trafficking, in alignment with 
our seven Sustainability Commitments. We implement 
rigorous measures to prevent these violations within  
our supply chain through thorough vetting of suppliers 
and continuous monitoring to identify and rectify any 
potential issues.
•	Supplier Code of Conduct
All suppliers must adhere to KLK’s Supplier Code of 
Conduct, covering human rights, fair labour practices, 
environmental protection, and ethical business conduct. 
We ensure that our palm related sources are aligned  
with our NDPE commitments. The Code is reviewed 
regularly to ensure it reflects evolving industry standards 
and best practices.
•	Transparency and Reporting
Transparency is a cornerstone of our supplier  
engagement. We require suppliers to report on their 
sustainability performance and provide an open grievance 
mechanism for stakeholders to report any concerns 
related to sustainability practices.
•	Supplier Screening & Grievance Management 
(“SSGM”)
KLK has established a robust and transparent Supplier 
Grievance Redressal Process managed by SSGM 
Committee, chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer.  
The SSGM Committee is responsible for the 
comprehensive screening of new and re-entry suppliers 
and the management of grievances within the palm oil 
supply chain based on both social and environmental 
criteria.
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT

•	High Risk Mills Engagement
KLK proactively monitors its supplying mills, prioritising those identified as high risk due to potential deforestation,  
fire, or peatland degradation. Mills are classified as high risk when their TTP data is incomplete or unavailable,  
or if over 25% of their supply shed overlaps with No Deforestation and Peat (“NDP”) risk areas. This risk classification  
aligns with our partner, Daemeter’s assessment methodology.
These high-risk mills are subject to enhanced monitoring and targeted engagement strategies, which include  
workshops, direct meetings, and providing technical assistance to address non-compliance issues. Additionally,  
assisting the mills to achieve full TTP enables more effective management and mitigation of risks.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Traceability is crucial for KLK as it allows us to maintain 
transparency, integrity, and accountability throughout 
our palm oil supply chain. It is an essential component 
in managing risks related to deforestation, biodiversity 
loss, and unethical practices, ensuring our suppliers and 
operations comply with KLK’s NDPE (No Deforestation,  
No Peat, No Exploitation) policies enforced.  
Our traceability practices help to verify the source of 
raw materials, monitor compliance and provide credible 
assurance to stakeholders about the sustainability of our 
products.
OUR APPROACH
•	Geospatial Monitoring
KLK employs geospatial monitoring tools and satellite 
imagery to track land use changes, ensuring that all 
palm oil sources are free from deforestation and peatland 
development. These technologies enable monitoring  
and rapid identification of any non-compliant areas, 
allowing for corrective action.
•	Supplier Engagement and Transparency
Engaging closely with suppliers is fundamental to  
achieving full traceability. KLK requires all suppliers 
to provide detailed information on their sourcing 
practices and supply chain, which is rigorously 
verified against our sustainability criteria. We 
actively collaborate with our suppliers to build their 
capacity in traceability and ensure compliance with 
KLK’s NDPE policies. Regular training sessions and 
capacity-building initiatives are provided to help  
suppliers improve their traceability practices and align 
with KLK’s sustainability commitments.
•	Compliance with the European Union Deforestation 
Regulation (“EUDR”)
As the European market is a significant one for KLK, 
compliance with the new EUDR is a priority. The 
EUDR requires that commodities such as palm oil do 
not contribute to deforestation and are produced in 
accordance with the sustainability criteria set by the EU. 
KLK is proactively working to ensure that our supply  
chain meets EUDR requirements. This includes  
enhancing our traceability processes, conducting

thorough due diligence on suppliers, and integrating 
EUDR compliance checks into our risk assessment 
framework. Our EUDR Task Force, established to address 
this specific requirement, is actively working to lead our 
efforts in ensuring compliance for supplies to European 
customers. 
•	Collaborations and Partnerships
KLK collaborates with NGOs, certification bodies  
(including RSPO, MSPO, ISPO, and ISCC), and other 
stakeholders to strengthen traceability efforts and 
provide transparency. These collaborations enable 
us to continually improve our traceability framework 
and promote best practices for sustainable palm oil 
production.
•	Supplier Mapping and Risk Assessment
We have mapped all our suppliers and conduct 
comprehensive risk assessments to identify potential 
sustainability risks. Suppliers deemed to pose higher 
risks are subject to more stringent monitoring and must 
implement corrective actions to meet our standards.
•	Progress Towards 100% Traceability
KLK is committed to achieve 100% Traceability to 
Plantations for Refineries and Kernel Crushing Plants, 
and to Mills for Oleochemical Plants. We are making 
steady progress towards this goal through continued 
investments in technology, supplier engagement, and 
stronger monitoring frameworks.
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
KLK Supplier Sustainability Conventions in Malaysia and Indonesia
In collaboration with NGOs such as Proforest in Malaysia 
and Daemeter in Indonesia, we conducted three  
successful supplier sustainability conventions this year, 
involving 110 participants from 63 suppliers. These 
sessions were designed to strengthen our commitment 
to supply chain sustainability and responsible sourcing,  
with a focus on KLK’s sustainability direction, evolving 
market demands, and EUDR compliance. As a result,  
we achieved a notable improvement in traceability 
scores across our Midstream and OLEO divisions.  
These partnerships and continuous dialogues have 
been crucial in fostering stronger relationships and 
encouraging sustainable practices across our supply 
chain. Looking ahead, we plan to formally recognise 
suppliers who have made significant strides in their 
sustainability efforts.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Reducing carbon emissions is our continuous effort to 
mitigate climate change impacts and to align with global 
climate goals, regulatory requirements, and market 
expectations. As an organisation operating in sectors with 
carbon footprints, KLK recognises the necessity of setting 
carbon emissions reduction and net-zero targets. Achieving 
these targets is not only about regulatory compliance but 
also about ensuring long-term business sustainability, 
reducing operational risks, and fostering trust with our 
stakeholders, including customers, investors, and local 
communities.
OUR APPROACH
•	Energy Efficiency Initiatives
Implementing energy-saving technologies and practices 
in mills, refineries, and oleochemical plants to reduce 
carbon intensity.
•	Renewable Energy Adoption
Expanding the use of renewable energy sources,  
such as solar and biomass, to power our operations.  
Several solar projects have been launched, and we aim

methane emissions from anaerobic decomposition. 
The resulting drier solid waste can also be repurposed 
for composting or as biofuel, supporting KLK’s circular 
economy practises in our oil palm estates.
•	Biogas Plant Development
Capturing biogas from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (“POME”)
and converting into biogas for energy – either for  
self-consumption or sold back to the grid.
•	Tracking and Reporting
Regular monitoring and transparent reporting of emissions 
data to ensure accountability and demonstrate progress 
towards our 2050 net-zero target.
CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION/NET ZERO
Taiko Palm-Oleo Zhangjiagang (“TPOZ”) Solar Rooftop 3.23 MWp Project
This	 project	 was	 initiated	 by	 TPOZ	 to	 promote	 the	
development of new projects in response to government 
requirements	for	green	and	low-carbon	initiatives.	TPOZ	
adopted clean energy, actively installed photovoltaic  
power generation facilities as a supportive measure, 
and effectively reduced the energy requirements for the 
new projects. Under the guidance of the headquarters, 
TPOZ	decided	to	install	photovoltaic	panels	on	existing	 
warehouse roofs, parking lots, office buildings, and other 
structures to achieve autonomous power generation.
Construction of the 3.23 MWp photovoltaic (“PV”) power 
generation project began on 12 June 2023. Over the 
course of 3.5 months, the project team completed roof 
cleaning, component bracket installation, photovoltaic 
panel laying, bridge cable installation, lightning protection 
grounding, cleaning system installation, and monitoring 
system installation in sequence. After system debugging,  
the project successfully passed the on-site acceptance 
inspection	by	Zhangjiagang	Power	Supply	Company	and	
was connected to the grid on 28 September 2023.
Throughout the entire photovoltaic power generation 
project, a total of 5,873 monocrystalline solar PV modules 
were installed on existing warehouse roofs, parking lots, 
office buildings, and other structures. The total installed 
capacity is 3,230.15 kW, using a 400 V low-voltage grid 
connection method. The expected annual electricity 
generation is approximately 3.25 million kW-hours, with an 
annual savings of 968 metric tonnes of standard coal and  
a reduction in CO2 emissions by 2,206 metric tonnes.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
We have refined our approach to the presentation of 
energy consumption to more accurately reflect KLK’s 
actual usage patterns. Recognising the importance of 
renewable sources in our operations, we have now included  
renewable energy consumption, marking a shift in how 
we account for and disclose energy data. For example, 
the utilisation of biomass boilers in our mill operations 
has provided a more sustainable energy source, reducing 
reliance on conventional fuels. To ensure consistency and 
accuracy, we have updated historical data for the last 
three financial years, aligning previous figures with the  
new reporting approach. Consequently, figures in prior 
annual reports may not be directly comparable with this 
year’s refined presentation.
This year, KLK achieved a 21% intensity reduction across 
Scope 1 and 2, compared to our FY2019 baseline year. 
FY2019 was selected as the baseline to represent normal 
operations before disruptions caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic. This baseline ensures a consistent foundation  
for measuring progress and aligns with industry best 
practices for meaningful comparisons. Our reduction  
efforts, driven by initiatives such as commissioning 
the Changkat Chermin biogas plant, ongoing process 
improvements in Manufacturing facilities, and increased 
reliance on renewable energy sources, reflect significant 
strides towards our 25% intensity reduction target. 
Emmerich Insulating Condensate Piping Project
This project was successfully completed in 2024 over 
a period of nine months. The project aimed to achieve 
significant energy and CO2 savings by insulating parts of 
the system within the condensate returns using a highly 
efficient insulating material with a thermal conductivity of 
0.041 W/(m*K). The key parameters of the project included 
a medium temperature of 90°C, an insulation length of  
2.6 km, an area of 542 m², 525 pipe bends, and pipe 
diameters ranging from DN25 to DN150. The project 
achieved an energy saving of 1.0 tonnes of steam per hour, 
which corresponds to approximately €400,000 per year,  
and a CO2 saving of 132 tonnes per year.
This project has shown that a relatively high savings  
potential can be generated with relatively little effort 
and that success does not always lie in the complexity 
of the projects. The commitment of colleagues and 
the supplier also played a crucial role in the project’s  
success, allowing for additional savings through 
subsidies. The ‘Insulating Condensate Piping’ project 
at the Emmerich site showcases how targeted energy 
efficiency initiatives can lead to substantial cost 
savings and environmental benefits. The success of 
this project highlights the importance of collaboration 
and the potential for further savings through subsidy 
programmes.

Production rationalisation at a European oleochemical  
site may prompt a review of baseline data for accuracy  
as part of our continuous improvement.
Our	 GHG	 intensity	 calculations	 currently	cover	 Scope	 1	
and 2 emissions across Plantation and Manufacturing 
operations. Scope 1 emissions encompass direct  
emissions from stationary and mobile combustion from 
fossil fuel use, and process emissions. Scope 2 captures 
indirect emissions from electricity purchased from the 
grid and steam sourced from third-party suppliers. 
Scope 3 emissions, covering indirect sources such 
as fertiliser production, are disclosed separately for 
Plantation operations, with efforts underway to include  
Manufacturing-related Scope 3 emissions in future 
reporting. This phased approach ensures accuracy while 
progressively expanding our emissions disclosures.
In the Plantation sector, Scope 1 emissions include  
fertiliser use, empty fruit bunch (“EFB”) and palm oil mill 
effluent (“POME”) emissions, and fossil fuel consumption 
in operations and heavy vehicles. Scope 2 emissions

reflect electricity purchases, while Scope 3 focuses on  
upstream emissions from inputs such as fertilisers and 
agrochemicals.	 The	 RSPO	 Palm	 GHG	 4.0	 converter	 is	 
applied to Plantation-related emissions to ensure  
alignment with industry standards. In Manufacturing,  
Scope 1 emissions stem from equipment such as 
boilers, thermal oil heaters, gas turbine generators, diesel 
generators, and forklift. As for Scope 2, emissions stem 
from electricity and steam purchases. For Manufacturing 
emissions,	we	adhere	to	the	GHG	Protocol,	providing	a	
consistent framework for cross-sector comparability.
We have excluded emissions from peat oxidation, land 
use change, and crop sequestration from our current  
GHG	calculations	but	will	consider	their	inclusion	in	future	
reporting cycles. These exclusions allow us to focus on  
direct and operational emissions, offering a clearer 
picture of our core activities’ environmental footprint.  
As methodologies evolve and new standards emerge, 
KLK is committed to refining reporting practices to  
ensure transparency and alignment with stakeholder 
expectations.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Water is an important resource for KLK’s plantation and 
manufacturing operations. Effective water management 
is vital to minimise water-related risks, particularly in 
regions facing water scarcity. Efficient use and sustainable 
management of water resources ensure KLK’s operations 
are resilient to climate change impacts and can maintain 
sustainable production levels.
OUR APPROACH
•	Water Stewardship Programmes
KLK has implemented comprehensive water stewardship 
programmes aimed at conserving water resources and 
ensuring their sustainable use. These programmes involve 
conducting water risk assessments, monitoring water 
usage, and implementing water-saving technologies.
•	Condensate Recovery in Oleochemical Production 
Facilities
In our oleochemical production facilities, KLK has 
implemented condensate recovery systems to reduce 
freshwater intake and energy consumption. Condensate, 
which is steam that has been cooled and condensed 
back into water, is recovered from the production 
processes and reused. This not only reduces the demand 
for fresh water but also lowers energy use by recycling 
heat energy from the steam. This approach aligns with  
our commitment to optimise resource efficiency and 
minimise our environmental impact.
•	Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation
KLK uses monitoring tools to regularly evaluate water 
consumption patterns and identify areas for improvement. 
This data-driven approach enables us to make informed 
decisions for further water conservation efforts. We also 
ensure that all water discharged from our operations 
meets regulatory standards and is safe for release into 
natural water bodies. Regular tests are conducted to 
assess water quality and mitigate potential risks.
•	Precision Water Delivery
At our plantation, we employ a targeted water dripping 
method for our oil palm tree nurseries, ensuring optimal 
water use and enhancing the growth conditions for  
young palms.
This year, we refined our methodology for calculating water 
consumption, allowing us to capture a more accurate 
picture of our actual water usage. In doing so, we have 
redefined water consumption as water withdrawal across 
all our operations, ensuring a consistent approach to data 
reporting.
As a result, water consumption figures for our Plantation  
and Manufacturing operations have been adjusted. 
Additionally, we have transitioned from reporting water 
recycled and reused as a percentage to using absolute 
figures. This change provides a more tangible representation 
of our efforts, facilitating better understanding and 
interpretation of the data.
For consistency and comparability, these refinements 
have been retrospectively applied to the data from the last  
three years. Figures presented in previous annual reports 
may be superceded by this updated approach.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
We recognise the critical role that forests and peatlands  
play in mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, 
and ensuring sustainable land use. High Carbon Stock  
(HCS) forests and peatlands store significant amounts 
of carbon, making their protection essential to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the degradation 
of peatlands poses risks to water management and 
biodiversity. Safeguarding these ecosystems not only  
aligns with global climate goals but also helps us meet 
our NDPE commitments, reinforcing our position as a 
responsible corporate citizen.
OUR APPROACH
•	No Deforestation Commitment
KLK has a strict no-deforestation policy that protects 
primary forests, HCS forests, and HCV areas. By 
preventing land clearing in these areas, KLK ensures that 
its operations do not contribute to deforestation.
•	High Carbon Stock Approach (“HCSA”)
We apply the HCSA toolkit to identify, conserve, and 
enhance forests with significant carbon and biodiversity 
values. This approach is integrated into our land-use 
planning to avoid deforestation in high-carbon areas.
•	Peatland Management
KLK has implemented best management practices for 
peatlands, including responsible water management,  
to maintain soil stability and reduce emissions. This also 
includes re-wetting degraded peatlands to restore their 
ecological function.
•	Hotspot and Fire Monitoring
KLK uses on-the-ground monitoring to detect and  
mitigate the risk of fire outbreaks in high-risk areas, 
particularly in peatlands. Our firefighting teams undergo 
annual training and conduct fire simulations, particularly 
during dry weather. Additionally, we engage with local 
communities to build awareness and prevent fire  
incidents.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
HCV areas are crucial for preserving biodiversity,  
ecosystem services, and cultural and social values.  
At KLK, maintaining HCV areas is integral to protecting 
endangered species, supporting healthy ecosystems, and 
sustaining the livelihoods of local communities who depend 
on these ecosystems. Biodiversity conservation is not 
only a corporate responsibility but also aligns with global 
commitments to combat biodiversity loss and enhance 
ecosystem resilience.
OUR APPROACH
•	Identifying and Managing HCV Areas
KLK employs the HCV approach to identify critical 
areas with significant biodiversity, ecological, or cultural 
value. These areas are managed and protected through  
dedicated conservation plans, ensuring that our 
agricultural and industrial activities do not negatively 
impact them.
•	Collaborative Conservation Efforts
We collaborate with various NGOs and government 
agencies, such as the Jabatan PERHILITAN, World 
Wildlife Fund (“WWF”), Earthworm Foundation,  
and local conservation organisations such as Bringing 
Back Our Rare Animals (“BORA”) and Persatuan  
Pelindung Harimau Malaysia (“RIMAU”). These 
partnerships strengthen our conservation efforts, 
particularly in forest and wildlife protection.
•	Restoring and Enhancing Biodiversity
KLK is committed to reforest degraded areas,  
maintaining wildlife corridors, and protect riparian zones. 
These initiatives help to restore habitats for endangered 
species and improve overall ecosystem health.
•	Monitoring and Reporting
We regularly monitor biodiversity within HCV areas and 
report on the health of these ecosystems. By applying 
robust assessment frameworks and working with  
external experts, KLK ensures that its biodiversity  
efforts are measurable and impactful.
•	Responsible Pesticide Management
We have eliminated the use of pesticides classified as 
Class 1A or 1B by the World Health Organisation and  
those listed under the Stockholm and Rotterdam 
Conventions. Additionally, we have discontinued the 
use of paraquat, except in rare, government-authorised 
situations, such as specific pest outbreaks, where its  
use is supported by a thorough due diligence process.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT AND REPORT
In collaboration with BORA, KLK, along with other  
partners, has undertaken the planting of Napier grass 
and Ficus trees at the Malambabula Wildlife Habitat 
Restoration Area within the Tabin Wildlife Reserve. This 
area, situated between KLK Ladang Rimmer and Ladang 
Tungku, aims to provide a consistent and attractive food 
source for the wild elephants that traverse in and out 
of the reserve, offering an alternative to oil palms. This 
restoration initiative is already showing positive results. 
In August 2024, it was reported that approximately 30 
elephants had entered the grass-planted pasture area 
within the Tabin Wildlife Reserve. With this ample food 
supply, we aim to keep the elephant herds within the 
reserve, thereby preventing them from straying into the 
neighbouring oil palm plantations.
Due to the proximity to the Endau-Rompin National Park, 
KLK Ladang Landak and Kampung Orang Asli Kudung 
experienced annual visits from elephants in search of  
food. Inspired by the encouraging results of the Wildlife  
Corridor project in the Tabin Wildlife Reserve, we have  
replicated this initiative in our Johor plantation. We have 
allocated one hectare of land to establish a permanent 
strategic food reserve in both Ladang Landak and  
Kampung Orang Asli Kudung. This initiative aims to  
minimise damage and prevent conflicts, addressing  
human-elephant conflict more effectively.
The Elephant Food Bank initiative is a collaborative effort 
involving the Johor Wildlife Department and Kampung 
Orang Asli Kudung.
Wildlife Habitat Restoration
In September 2023, partnering with WWF Malaysia, KLK embarked on a significant environmental initiative by  
allocating 7.1 hectares of land within KLK Ladang Bukit Tabin. This land is dedicated to create a crucial wildlife  
corridor that links the Tabin Wildlife Reserve with the isolated Silabukan Kecil Forest Reserve. To facilitate this  
connection, we have successfully planted 1,800 fast-growing forest tree species, establishing a vital pathway for  
wildlife to traverse between these two forest reserves. This project underscores our commitment to biodiversity  
conservation and sustainable land management.

Mangroves play a crucial role in coastal ecosystems, 
providing habitat for diverse marine life, protecting  
shorelines from erosion, and sequestering carbon.  
By rehabilitating these vital ecosystems, we are  contributing 
to the overall health of our environment. 
In collaboration with Global Environment Centre (“GEC”), 
we have launched a pilot project centred on community-
based mangrove conservation in Kuala Gula, Perak.  
We have planted 1,000 mangrove trees at the degraded 
mangrove area, and a unique aspect of this project is  
the active involvement of the local B40 fishing community.
Recognising the importance of community participation, 
we have engaged local residents in the maintenance and 
monitoring of the mangrove areas. This approach not only 
ensures the sustainability of the conservation efforts but 
also creates a new source of income for the community 
members.

Natural forests and ecosystems play an essential role in 
providing resources such as clean water, fresh air, food, 
as well as crucial natural buffers to extreme weather  
and flooding conditions. KLK continues to uphold 
its commitment to conservation by maintaining high 
conservation value areas such as the Secret Garden and 
Hundred Acre Woods within the concession in Sugut  
region of Sabah.
The Hundred Acre Woods at KLK Sawit Nusantara’s 
Ladang Sungai Sabang provides 42.26 hectares of land 
for conservation, research, and education purposes. This 
verdant plot of land plays a vital role as a functional green 
corridor, connecting and supporting neighbouring natural 
habitats.
Within this precious conservation area lies an arboretum 
featuring over 400 stands of tropical rainforest trees. 
Among them are native Borneo species such as Laran 
(Neolamarckia cadamba ), Sesenduk ( Endospermum 
spp.), Kapur Paji ( Dryobalanops lanceolata), Seraya Majau 
(Shorea johorensis ), and the endemic Shorea kudatensis . 
An avifauna survey identified approximately 70 bird  
species residing in the Hundred Acre Woods. Among 
the permanent residents are the rhinoceros and black  
hornbills, which rely on both wild and planted fruits in  
the orchard for sustenance. Additionally, the area is  
constantly visited by keystone species such as the  
Orangutan and Bornean Gibbons, which use this area as 
a stepping stone to connect to the larger neighbouring 
forest reserves, i.e., Forest Reserve Trusan Sugut.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Effective waste management is essential for KLK to  
minimise its environmental impact, reduce pollution, and 
contribute to circular economy principles. Managing 
waste responsibly aligns with KLK’s commitment to 
sustainability and helps mitigate risks associated with 
waste disposal, pollution, and resource depletion. Effective 
waste management practices also enhance operational 
efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with  
local and international environmental regulations.
OUR APPROACH
•	Waste Segregation and Recycling Initiatives
KLK implements waste segregation at all operational 
sites, separating recyclable materials such as plastics, 
paper, and metal from organic waste. Recycling stations 
are established to facilitate the efficient collection and 
processing of recyclables. The recovered materials are 
sent to certified recycling partners, helping to reduce  
the volume of waste sent to landfills.
•	Circular Economy Practices
KLK promotes circular economy practices by converting 
waste into valuable by-products. Palm kernel shells are 
repurposed as biomass for renewable energy generation 
in mills. This not only reduces waste but also lowers the 
dependency on fossil fuels, further reducing our carbon 
footprint.
•	Composting of Organic Waste
Organic waste generated from palm oil processing, such 
as empty fruit bunches (EFB) and fronds, are composted 
and used as fertiliser in plantations. This natural fertiliser 
enriches soil health, reduces the need for synthetic 
fertilisers, maintain soil moisture, and lowers greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with chemical fertiliser 
production.
•	Hazardous Waste Management
KLK adheres to stringent protocols for managing 
hazardous waste, including proper labelling, storage, 
and disposal in compliance with regulatory requirements. 
Hazardous waste, such as chemicals and used oil,  
is collected and disposed of through certified hazardous 
waste management companies to prevent environmental 
contamination.
•	Monitoring Air Quality/Pollution
We actively monitor air quality and pollution levels across 
our manufacturing plants to minimise environmental 
impact. Utilising air quality sensors and continuous 
monitoring systems, KLK tracks pollutants such as 
particulate matter and other emissions.
•	Partnerships and Community Engagement
KLK collaborates with local communities and  
stakeholders to enhance waste management practices 
beyond its direct operations. Education programmes 
and workshops are conducted to raise awareness  
about sustainable waste management and recycling 
practices.
•	Effluent treatment system
Palm oil mills in plantations treat palm oil mill effluent 
(“POME”) through aerobic and anaerobic processes,  
often incorporating biogas plants for energy and  
electricity. Additionally, treatment facilities are equipped 
with filter belt presses to recover organic solids from 
ponds for use as soil amendments. 
Refineries near mills combine palm oil refinery effluent 
(“PORE”) with POME for treatment, while distant refineries 
use on-site wastewater treatment plants (“WWTPs”) that 
employ physical processes and chemical treatments. 
Oleochemical plants utilise WWTPs with physical, 
chemical, and biological methods. These systems ensure 
compliance with environmental and regulatory standards.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Understanding the carbon footprint of our products is  
crucial for KLK to align with global climate goals and  
meet increasing regulatory and customer demands for 
sustainable products. Conducting Life Cycle Assessments 
(“LCAs”) and calculating Product Carbon Footprints 
(“PCFs”) enable us to identify hotspots of environmental 
impact, optimise resource use, and reduce greenhouse  
gas emissions across our product lifecycle. This approach 
not only reduces our environmental footprint but also 
enhances our market competitiveness by catering to the 
growing demand for greener products.
OUR APPROACH
•	PCF and LCA Calculations
We calculate the PCF for key product lines to 
provide transparency on the carbon impact of our 
products. LCA will be in accordance with ISO 14040  
and ISO 14044, while PCF will be in accordance with  
ISO 14067.
•	Manufacturing Optimisation
KLK has introduced energy-efficient technologies 
and renewable energy sources in its oleochemical  
production facilities. Efforts such as energy recovery 
systems and the use of biomass for power generation 
contribute significantly to reducing overall carbon 
emissions.
•	Product Stewardship
In collaboration with our customers, we promote 
sustainable consumption by providing information on 
the carbon footprint of our products and encouraging 
responsible usage and disposal.
•	Continuous Improvement through LCA and PCF
KLK continuously reviews and updates its LCA and 
PCF data to reflect changes in operations and supply  
chains, ensuring that we remain aligned with global 
sustainability standards and market expectations.
•	Material usage
As part of our LCA studies, we focus on the use of 
renewable and non-renewable materials throughout the 
product lifecycle. In future, we aim to increase the use  
of renewable materials such as biomass and reduce 
reliance on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels 
where possible.
This year, we engaged external consultants to verify the  
PCF of eight key products, including surfactant family. 
Building on this progress, we aim to verify additional  
product families next year, with the goal of having  
50 products with PCF .

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Health and safety are paramount to ensure the  
well-being of our workforce and fostering a culture of 
care and responsibility. At KLK, we recognise that a safe 
working environment not only protects our employees  
but also enhances productivity, reduces absenteeism,  
and mitigates risks associated with workplace incidents. 
As a responsible employer, KLK is committed to meet  
and exceed industry standards for health and safety to 
safeguard our workers, contractors, and visitors.
OUR APPROACH
KLK’s approach to health and safety involves  
comprehensive risk assessments, the implementation of 
robust safety management systems, and ongoing safety 
training for all employees. We have established stringent 
Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”) aligned with  
MS 1722:2011 and ISO 45001 standards across all 
operational sites, ensuring a uniform and high standard of 
workplace safety. Our safety initiatives include:
•	Regular Safety Training and Drills
All employees undergo periodic safety training, covering 
emergency response, hazard identification, and the  
use of personal protective equipment (“PPE”).
•	Incident Reporting and Investigation
We have a transparent reporting system for all incidents 
and near-misses, ensuring thorough investigation and 
timely corrective action.
•	Safety Committees
Each site has a dedicated Safety Committee 
responsible for monitoring compliance, conducting 
audits, and providing recommendations for continuous  
improvement.
•	Wellness Programmes
Beyond physical safety, we focus on occupational  
health through wellness programmes, including medical 
check-ups, ergonomic assessments, and mental health 
support.

In FY2024, KLK experienced four fatal incidents in 
Indonesia, reminding us of the critical importance of 
stringent safety measures and continuous improvement 
in health and safety practices. Two of these incidents 
occurred during commute to work, which are recorded 
as fatalities under local regulation in Indonesia. Each 
incident has been thoroughly investigated to understand 
its root causes, which ranged from vehicular blind spots 
and handling of sharp equipment to risks associated with 
worker transportation and equipment management. We 
have implemented a series of corrective and preventive  
actions in response, such as revising our Hazard 
Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Control 
(“HIRARC”) frameworks to better address risks related  
to traffic management and equipment handling.
Furthermore, safety awareness campaigns and targeted 
training sessions have been conducted in collaboration  
with external experts, including traffic police and certified 
safety professionals, to ensure that all employees 
and contractors are well-versed in safe operational  
procedures.
Group Lost Time Injury (“LTI”)
This year, we have successfully reduced our lost time  
injuries by 23% as compared to FY2020, which marks 
significant progress toward our safety goals. While we 
are slightly short of our commitment to a 25% reduction, 
this achievement reflects our ongoing efforts to enhance 
workplace safety. We remain focused on further improving 
our safety measures and are committed to continue our 
work to meet this target in the coming years.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO KLK
Labour relations and human rights are fundamental to  
KLK’s sustainable growth. As a multinational corporation 
operating in diverse geographies, maintaining fair labour 
practices and upholding human rights is critical for  
fostering a healthy, motivated, and ethical workforce. 
Respecting labour rights not only ensures compliance with 
international standards but also mitigates risks related 
to reputational damage, legal challenges, and potential 
disruptions in operations.
OUR APPROACH
•	Fair Labour Practices
KLK upholds fair labour practices by implementing a 
zero-tolerance policy against forced and child labour  
and ensuring freedom of association. We engage 
with workers to understand their concerns better. In 
collaboration with NGOs and local authorities, ongoing 
efforts focus on training and capacity-building for  
managers and workers to uphold ethical labour  
standards, including workplace rights, health and 
safety, anti-discrimination, and diversity to empower  
our workforce.
•	Employee Grievance Mechanism
An effective grievance mechanism allows employees 
to report concerns anonymously and without fear of 
retaliation. This mechanism is regularly reviewed and 
improved to address employee issues promptly and 
transparently.
•	Human Rights Due Diligence
Regular human rights impact assessments and due 
diligence processes are in place to identify, prevent,  
and mitigate potential human rights risks. These 
assessments align with international frameworks  
such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation 
(ILO).
•	Worker Welfare
We ensure our foreign workers’ well-being by providing 
basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation,  
healthcare services, and compliant housing facilities. 
Recreational and religious facilities are available to  
promote  well-being, social interaction, and inclusivity.
•	Improvement of Recruitment Policy
KLK is improving and strengthening its recruitment 
policy to prevent unethical practices, such as charging 
recruitment fees to workers. We are working closely with 
our recruitment agencies to ensure full compliance with 
ethical standards, transparency in the hiring process, and 
fair treatment of all workers.
In last year’s annual report, we shared that a region-wide 
human rights risk assessment was conducted on our estates 
and mills in Peninsular Malaysia. This assessment, carried 
out by a third independent party in 2023, focused on two 
key outcomes: (1) evaluating the state of recruitment fees 
paid by workers, and (2) diagnosing the human rights risk 
rating across our operating centres based on International  
Labour Organisation’s (“ILO”) forced labour indicators.
The assessment was carried comprehensively involving 
management interviews, industry benchmarks, and 
interviews covering over 70% of the guest worker  
population in Peninsular Malaysia at the time of the 
assessment. To date, as per KLK’s No Recruitment 
Fee policy, all reimbursements to workers have been  
completed.
Building on the findings, key improvement areas identified 
were:
1. Strengthening recruitment processes
Over the years, KLK has continuously implemented 
improvements and enhancements to the recruitment 
of guest workers into Peninsular Malaysia. The 
highlights of recent efforts include working closely  
with recruitment agents to ensure that our policy  
is being adhered to (i.e., ensure awareness and 
understanding of policy, mapping out all costs of 
recruitment, tightly monitoring sourcing of candidates, 
etc.). Additionally, KLK introduced grievance channels 
that go directly to the headquarters during the  
recruitment cycle to ensure that grievances by 
candidates can be captured.
2. Improving usage of grievance channels
In 2024, KLK introduced a pilot digital channel  
in the form of a QR code in selected estates. This 
supplements the existing five channels – hotline,  
post, logbook, email, suggestion box. Grievances 
raised will be attended to by a group involving Human 
Resource, Sustainability, and Internal Audit.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
For KLK, investing in training and education is critical to 
building a skilled and empowered workforce capable of 
driving operational excellence, safety, and sustainability. 
Continuous professional development not only enhances 
employee productivity but also fosters career growth and 
retention. Equally, providing access to quality education 
for workers’ children ensures that they, too, have the 
opportunity to thrive and contribute positively to society, 
helping to break cycles of poverty and promote social 
upliftment in plantation communities.
OUR APPROACH
•	Comprehensive Training Programmes
KLK offers a wide range of training programmes tailored 
to different roles within the organisation, focusing on 
technical, operational, and soft skills. We collaborate  
with external partners to provide specialised training in 
areas such as health and safety, sustainable practices, 
and leadership development.
The past two years have been extensive and intensive focus on the risks in Peninsular Malaysia. With key  
improvements being carried out, the attention now shifts to other regions. Specifically, KLK has kicked off a risk  
assessment in selected estates in Sabah. Similarly, the findings and outcome of the assessment shall guide KLK  
on the gaps to be acted upon.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Employee well-being is a key factor in creating a motivated, 
productive, and resilient workforce. For KLK, promoting 
well-being goes beyond just providing a safe working 
environment—it includes supporting physical, mental, and 
emotional health. Prioritising well-being helps to reduce 
absenteeism, increase job satisfaction, and enhance 
overall performance. In the long run, this contributes to 
KLK’s operational excellence and the sustainability of its 
workforce.
OUR APPROACH
•	Health and Wellness Programmes
A range of health and wellness initiatives are offered, 
including regular health screenings, fitness programmes, 
and mental health support services. These programmes 
are designed to address both the physical and 
psychological well-being of employees, ensuring they 
have access to resources that help them stay healthy  
and productive.
•	Work-Life Balance Initiatives
Flexible working hours, leave entitlements, and family-
friendly policies are encouraged to promote work-life 
balance. A well-balanced work-life dynamic leads to 
improved job satisfaction and helps to retain talent in  
the long term.
•	Accessible Health Care for Employees and Families
In addition to our robust health and safety protocols,  
KLK provides access to healthcare facilities for  
employees and their families, particularly in plantation 
estates. On-site clinics and partnerships with healthcare 
providers ensure that employees have access to  
medical care when needed.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT
Smallholders are key stakeholders in our palm oil supply 
chain. Supporting them helps KLK ensure sustainable 
palm oil production, maintain high standards of quality, and 
foster resilient communities. By investing in smallholder 
development, KLK also mitigates risks associated with 
non-compliant sourcing and reinforces our commitment 
to sustainable practices. Ensuring smallholders meet 
international market requirements, such as the EU 
Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), is crucial for their access 
to global markets and the continuity of our sustainable 
supply chain.
OUR APPROACH
•	Capacity Building Programmes
We provide smallholders with comprehensive training  
on sustainable agricultural practices, pest management, 
and efficient fertiliser use. These initiatives aim to  
increase productivity while minimising environmental 
impact.
•	Financial and Market Access Support
KLK offers financial incentives, access to quality 
seeds, and assistance in achieving certification under 
schemes such as RSPO and MSPO. We actively support 
smallholders in meeting EUDR requirements, ensuring 
they maintain access to the EU market and benefit  
from premium pricing for certified products.
•	Collaborative Partnerships
Through collaborations with government bodies, 
NGOs, and industry stakeholders, we strengthen 
smallholder resilience to market volatility and climate-
related challenges. Initiatives such as partnerships 
with organisations including United States Agency for 
International Development (“USAID”), Sabah Wildlife 
Department, Earthworm Foundation, Global Shepherds, 
Etania Schools, and Humana Child Aid Society in  
Sabah, enable more smallholders to adopt sustainable 
farming techniques and gain financial literacy, enhancing 
their readiness for global market access.
•	Facilitating Market Access
KLK is committed to help smallholders navigate 
evolving market regulations such as the EUDR. By 
providing guidance on compliance, documentation, and  
traceability requirements, we ensure smallholders  
remain competitive in international markets.

The Board of Directors (“Board”) of KLK is pleased to 
present the Corporate Governance Overview Statement 
(“CG Overview Statement”) for the financial year (“FY”) 
ended 30 September 2024. The CG Overview Statement 
explains how the Board recognises corporate governance 
as being essential for the long-term sustainability of the 
Group’s businesses and performance. To this end, the 
Board devotes considerable effort to identify and formalise 
best practices to maintain high standards of corporate 
governance throughout the Group. Such commitment 
is based on the belief that sound and effective corporate 
governance practices are fundamental to the smooth, 
effective and transparent operation of a company and its 
ability to enhance long-term shareholders’ value, increase 
investors’ confidence and protect stakeholders’ interests.

functions in the decision-making process.

effectiveness and consistency with the Board’s

II. BOARD COMPOSITION
 The Board is confident that a diverse and inclusive 
composition will enable it to draw on the varied 
perspectives of its members, fostering strong 
stewardship and ensuring long-term growth.
 There were eight (8) members on the Board of  
Directors for FY2024, comprising two (2) Executive 
(Chairman and COO) and six (6) Non-Executive 
Directors, four (4) of whom are Independent.
 The Board, through its NC, reviews annually the size  
and composition of the Board and each Board 
Committee, and the skills and core competencies of 
its members, to ensure an appropriate balance and 
diversity of skills and experience. The Board and its 
NC have upon their annual assessment, concluded 
that the current Board comprises of a balanced mix 
of skills, knowledge and experience in the business 
and management fields which are relevant to enable 
the Board to carry out its responsibilities in an  
effective and efficient manner.
 The composition of the Board for the FY under  
review and at present, meets the requirements  
of the Main LR of at least one-third (1/3) of the Board 
being independent.
 Independent Directors
The Board recognises the importance of 
independence and objectivity in the decision-making 
process. For FY2024, the Board comprised of  
four (4) Independent Directors, one (1), Mr. Quah 
Poh Keat, of whom the Board had designated as  
the Senior Independent Director.
The MCCG recommends that the tenure of an 
Independent Director should not exceed a cumulative 
term of nine (9) years and if the Board continues to 
retain the Independent Director after the ninth (9th) 
year, a two-tier voting process should be applied.  
For FY2024, none of the Independent Directors  
of the Company has served for a cumulative term  
of more than nine (9) years.
 Board Diversity
The Board acknowledges the importance of  
boardroom diversity and the establishment of a  
gender diversity policy. Hence, the Select Committee 
on Board Gender Diversity, which is delegated the 
responsibility to source for suitably qualified female 
candidates for the Board, had been searching for 
suitably qualified female candidates as the NC remains 
committed to improving boardroom diversity in 
terms of race, religion, gender, regional and industry 
experience, cultural and geographical background, 
ethnicity, age and perspective.
There were eight (8) members on the Board of  
Directors for FY2024, two (2) of whom are female 
Directors, making a total of 25% female participation 
on the Board. Notwithstanding the Board complies 
with the Main LR to have at least one (1) female 
Director, it remains committed to a minimum 30% 
female representation on the Board. Hence, the 
Board will consider the appointment of an additional 
female Director as and when vacancies arise and 
circumstances permit. The Board will also take steps 
to nurture suitable and potential candidates equipped 
with the competency, skills, experience, character,  
time commitment, integrity and other qualities in 
meeting the future needs of the Company.
 Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution, all 
Directors who are appointed by the Board are subject 
to re-election by shareholders at the next Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) immediately after their 
appointment.  In accordance with the Constitution, 
one-third (1/3) of the Directors is required to submit 
themselves for re-election by rotation at each AGM. All 
the Directors are subject to retirement at an interval of 
at least once in every three (3) years. The Directors who 
are standing for re-election at the forthcoming AGM 
are disclosed in the notice of AGM.
 Board Appointment
The NC maintains a formal and transparent procedure 
for the selection and recruitment of new Directors.  
Apart from reviewing the size, composition and 
diversity of the Board annually, the NC also assesses 
the suitability of identified candidates for membership 
of the Board and its Committees. The criteria for 
selection thereto is guided by the Directors’ Fit and 
Proper Policy.
The Board continues to use independent sources or 
search firms to identify suitably qualified candidates, 
should the need arise, instead of relying solely on 
the recommendation of existing Board, Executive 
Chairman or major shareholders.
 Nomination Committee
The NC has been established since 2001. The NC’s 
responsibility, among others, is to identify and 
recommend the right candidate with the necessary 
skills, experience and competencies to be filled in the 
Board and Board Committees. Recruitment matters 
are discussed in depth by the NC before the entire 
Board makes the final decision on new appointments.  
The NC has its own written TOR which deals with its 
authority and duties. The NC’s TOR was last updated in 
May 2022 and is available on the Company’s website, 
www.klk.com.my.
For FY2024, the NC comprised exclusively  
Non-Executive Directors, the majority of whom are 
independent, as follows:
Dato’ Lee Hau Hian (Chairman)
- Non-Independent Non-Executive Director
Mrs. Anne Rodrigues
- Independent Non-Executive Director
Tan Sri Shahril Ridza bin Ridzuan
- Independent Non-Executive Director

assessment to evaluate the performance of the  
Board, its Board Committees and each individual  
Director during the FY under review. The Board 
acknowledges that the conduct of an annual board 
evaluation provides an invaluable opportunity to  
appraise Board efficiency, evaluate its composition, 
and pinpoint areas where enhancements can be  
made to optimise board effectiveness.
The Board is an engaged and consensual board 
working in harmony and has forged a relationship 
among members and management built on trust, 
openness and respect. There are open discussions 
and consensus-driven decision-making. There are 
no major concerns relating to the evaluation of 
KLK’s Board overall effectiveness, although some 
improvements may be desirable in certain parameters 
to further enhance the Board’s performance.
A summary of the results and all feedback received  
was tabled to the NC for deliberation before  
appropriate action plans were recommended to the 
Board for further discussion and approval.
The findings and results of the assessment were 
properly documented, summarised and reported 
to the Board. The results of the annual assessment 
for the FY under review revealed that the Board 
and Board Committees had carried out their duties 
well and amicably with most of the questions rated 
positively. The Board agreed that it had performed  
well in these challenging times and was satisfied  
with its overall performance, with some areas identified 
for improvements.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
The NC concluded that the Board and Board 
Committees were satisfied with their existing 
composition, and were of the view that with the  
current mix of skills, knowledge, experience and 
strength of the Directors, the Board, respective Board 
Committees and Directors were able to discharge  
their duties effectively. Hence, the Board will  
continue to focus on the identified areas for 
improvement.
 Induction or Orientation for new Director
The Board recognises the importance of conducting  
a comprehensive induction or orientation programme 
for a new director in order to familiarise the new 
director with the businesses and governance practices 
of the Group. The programme also allows the new 
director to get acquainted with Senior Management, 
thereby facilitating board interaction and independent 
access to Senior Management. Upon appointment,  
the new Director goes through a comprehensive 
induction or orientation programme and is briefed  
on the Group’s activities, operations and policies 
during visits to various KLK Group operating centres 
to enable him/her to assimilate into the new role.  
The site visits will include briefings from the 
Management of operational units to provide further 
depth and appreciation of the key drivers behind  
the Group’s core businesses. Such sessions are 
reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain relevant 
and effective.
 Continuous Development Programme for all 
Directors
The Board oversees the training needs of its  
Directors. Directors are regularly updated on the 
Group’s businesses and the competitive and  
regulatory environment in which they operate.  
Directors are encouraged to visit the Group’s  
operating centres to have an insight into the Group’s 
various operations which would assist the Board  
to make effective decisions relating to the Group.
The Directors recognise the importance of continuing 
development by attending conferences, briefings and 
workshops to update their knowledge and enhance 
their skills. All Directors are encouraged to attend 
various external professional programmes relevant  
and useful in contributing to the effective discharge 
of their duties as Directors. In this respect, in-
house briefings by External Auditors, solicitors 
and/or Management are organised from time to 
time to update Directors on relevant statutory and 
regulatory requirements and the Group’s business and  
operational practices.
All Directors have attended the Mandatory 
Accreditation Programme (“MAP”) Part I on corporate 
governance and director’s roles, duties and liabilities 
and completed the MAP Part II on sustainability,  
as required under the Main LR.
To foster a more immersive learning experience, 
Management arranged on-site visits, providing 
valuable opportunities for informal engagement 
between the Board and Management teams across  
the Group’s operations. These visits enhanced 
Directors’ contributions to the Group’s operations and 
kept them updated on industry-specific developments.
For the FY under review, Directors have attended 
various programmes to keep abreast of general 
economic, industry and technical developments, as 
well as changes in legislation and regulations affecting 
the Group’s operations. Particulars of various training 
programmes attended by the Directors during FY2024

III. REMUNERATION
 Remuneration Policy and Procedures for Directors 
and Senior Management 
 The Board has in place a formal Remuneration Policy 
for Directors and Senior Management (“Remuneration 
Policy”). The Remuneration Policy establishes a 
formal and transparent procedure for developing a 
structure for the remuneration of Directors and Senior 
Management of the Company with the objective of 
supporting and driving business strategy and the  
long-term interests of the Company.
 The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to:
(i) determine the level of remuneration of Directors 
and Senior Management; 
(ii) attract, retain and reward high performing, 
experienced and qualified Directors and Senior 
Management by providing remuneration 
commensurate with their responsibilities and 
contributions, and be competitive with the 
industry; and
(iii) encourage value creation for the Company 
by aligning the interests of Directors with the  
long-term interests of shareholders.
 The Board, through the RC will conduct a periodic 
review of the criteria to be used in recommending 
the remuneration package of Directors and Senior 
Management to ensure that it is in line with current 
market practices and needs.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
 The Remuneration Policy was last revised and updated 
in May 2022 and is accessible on the Company’s 
website, www.klk.com.my.
 Remuneration Committee
 The RC has been established since 1994.  
Its primary responsibility is to structure and review  
the remuneration policies and procedures for  
executives of the Group, with a view to ensure 
that compensation and other benefits encourage 
performance that enhances the Group’s long-term 
profitability and value. The RC’s recommendations  
on the remuneration package for Senior Management 
and that for the Executive Chairman, are subject 
to the approval of the Board, and in the case  
of Non-Executive Directors’ fees and benefits,  
the approval of the shareholders. The RC has a TOR  
which deals with its authority and duties. The TOR of 
the RC was last updated in May 2022 and is available 
on the Company’s website, www.klk.com.my.
 For FY2024, the RC comprised exclusively  
Non-Executive Directors, the majority of whom are 
independent, as follows:

 Directors’ Remuneration
 The Company’s framework on Directors’ remuneration 
has the underlying objectives of attracting and 
retaining Directors of high calibre needed to run the 
Group successfully. In the case of the Executive 
Directors, the various components of the remuneration 
are structured so as to link rewards to corporate and 
individual performance. In the case of Non-Executive 
Directors, the level of remuneration reflects the 
expertise, experience and level of responsibilities 
undertaken by a particular Non-Executive Director 
concerned. The Non-Executive Directors are paid 
a meeting allowance for each Board meeting they  
attend. Similarly, members to Board Committees are  
also paid a meeting allowance for each Committee 
meeting they attend. The Directors are also reimbursed 
reasonable expenses incurred by them in the course 
of carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
 In November 2024, the RC undertook a review 
of the fees for the Non-Executive Directors and 
their respective Board Committees. This review 
included benchmarking against selected similar-
sized companies within the same industry  to ensure 
competitiveness. It also considered the increased 
responsibilities and expanded time commitments 
required of the ARC. Based on this review, the RC 
recommended, and the Board approved the  Directors’ 
and Board Committees’ fees for FY2024, as follows:
•	No	 change	 to	 the	 Directors’	 fees	 payable	 to	 the	 
Non-Executive Directors.
•	No	change	to	the	fees	payable	to	the	RC	and	NC.
•	An	increase	in	the	fees	for	the	chairman	and	members	
of the ARC to reflect their enhanced responsibilities 
and increased time commitments.
 Details of Directors’ remuneration (including benefits-  
in-kind) and the aggregate remuneration of Directors  
at the Company and Group levels during the FY

PRINCIPLE B – EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK  
MANAGEMENT
I. Audit and Risk Committee
 The ARC of the Company is chaired by the Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director, Mr. Quah 
Poh Keat. It comprises three (3) Independent  
Non-Executive Directors and one (1) Non-Independent 
Non-Executive Director, with diverse backgrounds 
and extensive experience in risk assessment and 
management, banking, finance, taxation, internal 
audits, corporate governance, etc.
 The ARC has a key role in the oversight of the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control systems of the Company. Its key function is 
to assist the Board to assess the risks and control 
environment, oversee the financial reporting process, 
evaluate the internal and external audit process, and 
review any conflict of interest situations and related 
party transactions. The roles and responsibilities of 
the ARC are governed in its TOR which is periodically 
assessed, reviewed and updated by the ARC or as  
and when there are changes to the regulatory 
requirements and direction or strategies of the 
Company that may affect the ARC’s role. Upon review, 
the proposed changes will be recommended to the 
Board for approval.
 The term of office and performance of the ARC and 
each of its members are reviewed annually by the  
Board through the NC, to ensure the ARC and its 
members have carried out their duties in accordance 
with their TOR. The TOR of the ARC was last reviewed 
in May 2024 and is available on the Company’s  
website, www.klk.com.my.
 The details of how the ARC carried out its roles and 
responsibilities during the FY under review are set  
out in the ARC Report of this Annual Report 2024.
 Assessment of Suitability, Objectivity and 
Independence of External Auditors
 At its meeting in November 2024, the ARC assessed 
the suitability and independence of the Company’s 
External Auditors, Messrs. BDO PLT (“BDO”). The 
ARC considered the quality of BDO’s performance, 
the adequacy of their experience and resources for 
the KLK Group, and their independence, including  
the level of non-audit services provided to the KLK 
Group for FY2024.
 The ARC was satisfied with the performance and 
suitability of BDO based on the quality of services, 
time commitment and resources of BDO, and their 
professionalism and dedication in relation to the 
FY2024 audit. The ARC was also satisfied in its  
review that the provision of non-audit services by  
BDO to KLK Group for FY2024 did not in any way 
impair BDO’s objectivity and independence as  
External Auditors of KLK.
 Having regard to the outcome of the annual 
assessment of BDO, the Board approved the ARC’s 
recommendation that shareholders’ approval be 
sought at the forthcoming AGM for the re-appointment 
of BDO as External Auditors of the Company for the  
FY ending 30 September 2025.
II. Risk Management Framework
 Risk Management and Internal Controls
 The Board acknowledges the importance of a sound 
risk management system and internal controls, and  
is supported by the ARC and Group Risk  
Management Committee (headed by the Executive 
Chairman) respectively to ensure the risks in the  
Group are identified and managed with the appropriate 
risk management system. The risk management 
process includes identifying principal business risks  
in critical areas, assessing the likelihood and impact of 
material exposures and determining its corresponding 
risk mitigation and treatment measures.
 In this respect, the Board is briefed on potential 
fraud, whistleblowing and internal audit findings 
in order for them to assess the integrity of the 
Group’s financial information, and the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal  
controls and risk management processes.
 Under the risk management framework, the Board, 
through the Group Risk Management Committee,  
sets out the risk appetite of the Group whilst the 
Group Risk Management Committee ensures the 
effectiveness of risk management and adherence to 
the risk appetite established by the Board.
 Having reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management and internal control 
system for the FY under review, the Board is of the 
view that the risk management and internal control 
system is satisfactory and there were no material 
losses incurred during the FY under review as a result 
of internal control weakness or adverse compliance 
events. The details of the Risk Management and  
Internal Control Framework are set out in the  
Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control  
of this Annual Report 2024.
 Internal Audit Function
 The Board recognises the importance of risk 
management and internal controls in the overall 
management processes. An adequately resourced 
Internal Audit division is in place to assist the Board  
in maintaining a system of internal control to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets. 
The Internal Audit division, which reports directly to 
the ARC, is responsible to conduct reviews on the 
system of internal controls and the effectiveness of 
the processes that are in place to identify, evaluate, 
manage and report risks.

 An overview of the Group’s risk management and  
state of internal controls is set out in the Statement  
on Risk Management & Internal Control and ARC 
Report of this Annual Report.
 Corporate Ethics and Integrity
 Taking cognisance of the introduction of corporate 
liability by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
(Amendment) Act 2018, the Group has taken various 
proactive actions to strengthen the Group’s internal 
processes and practices. This is to ensure adequate 
procedures are in place to mitigate the risk of persons 
associated with the Group committing corruption.
 The Group’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (“ABAC”) 
Committee which comprises personnel across 
several departments continues to monitor formulated 
action plans to mitigate bribery and corruption risks 
within the Group. On an annual basis, Directors and 
employees attend anti-corruption training and sign 
ABAC declaration forms. A review of the Group’s 
ABAC Programme and Whistleblowing Framework, 
and its state of compliance was also completed by  
the Internal Audit division in FY2024.
PRINCIPLE C – INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE 
REPORTING AND MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP  
WITH STAKEHOLDERS
I. Communication with Stakeholders
 KLK upholds a strong culture of continuous, timely 
and equal dissemination of material information  
with shareholders, stakeholders, media and  
regulators through practicable and legitimate  
channels. Its commitment, both in principle and 
practice, is to maximise transparency consistent  
with good corporate governance, except where 
commercial confidentiality dictates otherwise.
 Effective Dissemination of Information
 Announcements and the release of financial results  
on a quarterly basis are posted on the Company’s 
website, which will provide the shareholders and 
the investing public with an overview of the Group’s 
performance and operations. 
 The Company’s website is publicly accessible at  
www.klk.com.my and the Directors welcome  
feedback channelled through the website.
 As there may be instances where investors and 
shareholders may prefer to raise their concerns to 
an independent director, the Board has appointed 
Mr. Quah Poh Keat, as the Senior Independent  
Non-Executive Director to whom concerns may be 
directed.
 Investor Relations
 The Board recognises the importance of keeping 
shareholders, investors, research analysts, 
bankers and the press informed of the Group’s 
business performance, operations and corporate 
developments.  The Board’s primary contact with  
major shareholders is via the Executive Chairman, 
COO, Head of Corporate and the Investor Relations 
department, who have regular dialogues with 
institutional investors and deliver presentations to 
analysts periodically.
 For FY2024, Management has attended various 
meetings including tele-conferences and video-
conferences with both local and foreign investors  
and analysts. These meetings are scheduled to  
keep the investment community abreast of the  
Group’s strategic developments and financial 
performance.
 The Company’s website, www.klk.com.my serves 
as a channel of communication for shareholders, 
investors and the general public. Information such 
as disclosures made to Bursa Malaysia (including 
interim and full year financial results, Annual Report 
and other announcements on relevant transactions 
undertaken by the Group), Company Profile,  
Corporate Information, Group Policies, Corporate 
Mission & Values, the respective TOR of the ARC, 
NC and RC etc., can be obtained from the website. 
Requests for information on the Company can 
be forwarded to its dedicated Investor Relations 
department through the same website.
 Pursuant to the best practices in corporate 
governance, Mr. Quah Poh Keat continues to serve 
as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director  
to whom concerns of investors and shareholders  
may be directed.
 Compliance with Applicable Financial Reporting 
Standards
 The Board takes due care and responsibility for 
presenting a fair, balanced and comprehensible 
assessment of the Group’s operations, performance 
and prospects each time it releases its quarterly 
and annual financial statements to shareholders and 
the general public. The ARC plays a crucial role in 
reviewing information to be disclosed to ensure its 
accuracy, adequacy, transparency and compliance 
with the appropriate accounting standards and the 
financial statements give a true and fair view of  
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group.
 In respect of the financial statements for FY2024,  
the Directors have:
•	adopted appropriate accounting policies and  
applied them consistently;
•	made judgements and estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent; and
•	ensured that all applicable accounting standards 
have been followed, subject to any explanations 
disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

 The Directors are responsible for ensuring that proper 
accounting records are kept and which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy the financial position of the 
Company and the Group to enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2016. They have an overall responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Company, to prevent  
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
 Corporate Disclosure Policy and Procedures
 The Company and the Group are committed to a 
policy which provides accurate, balanced, clear,  
timely and complete disclosure of corporate 
information to enable investors to make informed 
and orderly market decisions. Importance is also 
placed on the timely and orderly dissemination of 
material information to the stakeholders, media and 
regulators. In this respect, the Company has in place 
a Corporate Disclosure Policy, which is accessible  
on the Company’s website, www.klk.com.my,  
to ensure that comprehensive, accurate and timely 
disclosures are provided to shareholders and 
stakeholders.
 The objectives of the Corporate Disclosure Policy  
and Procedures are to:
(a) confirm in writing KLK’s existing disclosure 
policies, guidelines and procedures and 
ensure consistent approach to the Company’s  
disclosure practices throughout the Company; 
(b)  ensure that all persons to whom this Disclosure 
Policy applies understand their obligations 
to preserve the confidentiality of material  
information; 
(c)  effectively increase understanding of the 
Company’s business and enhance its corporate 
image by encouraging practices that reflect 
openness, accessibility and co-operation; and

INTRODUCTION
The risk management framework and internal control  
system are designed to identify, evaluate and manage 
risks that could impede the achievement of the business 
objectives and strategies. 
This Statement does not cover associates and joint  
ventures where risk management and internal control are 
managed by the respective management teams.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITY 
The Board affirms its overall responsibility in maintaining  
a sound risk management and internal control system 
at KLK to safeguard the interest of our stakeholders and  
the Group’s assets. 
In view of the limitations inherent in any system of risk 
management and internal control, the system is designed  
to manage, rather than to eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve the policies, goals and objectives of the Group. 
Therefore, it can only provide reasonable, rather than 
absolute assurance against material misstatement of 
management and financial information, financial losses, 
fraud and breaches of laws or regulations.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND ACTIVITIES
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
KLK’s risk management framework and processes 
encompasses identifying the Group’s key risks, evaluating 
and providing reasonable assurance in managing the risks 
within its risk appetite. The aim is to set clear guidelines  
to the level of risks acceptable to the Group.
The Risk Management Framework adopts a combination  
of top-down approach to identify the Group’s key risks  
and a bottom-up approach to identify operational risks.
The Board is supported by the Group Risk Management 
Committee (“GRMC”), headed by the Executive Chairman 
in overseeing the risk management efforts within the  
Group. The GRMC provides invaluable support to both 
the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”) in 
driving effective risk awareness culture, methodology  
and skills.
In line with the Group’s stance to promote a robust 
risk management process, interactive brainstorming  
workshops were carried out in 2024, in addition to the 
regular Sector Risk Management Committees (“SRMC”) 
meetings to identify risks from a clean slate. The objective 
is to ensure material risks are adequately covered,  
as well as aligned with the Group’s strategic objectives  
and overall risk appetite.
Following, the SRMCs and Functional Support Services 
(“FSS”) submit the principal risks to the GRMC.  
The GRMC deliberates on the key risks and performs  
deep-dive reviews on strategic topics before reporting  
to the ARC and the Board. Thereafter, feedbacks 
and recommendations are cascaded to the Regional 
Offices/Operating Centers for their remedial actions. 
Notwithstanding the above, any emerging principal 
risks that may arise during the year will be escalated  
immediately to the GRMC for evaluation and review.
The overall process is coordinated twice a year by the 
Enterprise Risk Manager of the Risk Management Unit, 
in collaboration with the SRMC and FSS, for half yearly 
reporting to the GRMC, the ARC and the Board, as set out 
in the diagram below:
The Board of Directors of KLK is pleased to provide the 
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control 
(“Statement”) which outlines the nature and scope  
of risk management of the Group for the financial year 
under review.

INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK
The following are implemented to assist the Board in 
maintaining a sound internal controls system within the 
Group.
Board Meetings
At a minimum, the Board meets on a quarterly basis  
and has a formal agenda on matters for discussion.  
The Executive Chairman leads the presentation of board 
papers and provide explanation on pertinent issues, while 
the Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) delivers operational 
updates to ensure the Board has a clear view of the 
operational landscape to enhance its strategic discussions. 
Where appropriate, recommendations are made to the 
Board in line with the Group’s risk appetite to ensure 
alignment with its objectives. A thorough deliberation and 
discussion by the Board is a prerequisite before arriving  
at any decision. In addition, the Board is kept updated  
on the Group’s activities and operations on a timely and 
regular basis.
Organisational Structure with Formally Defined 
Responsibility Lines and Delegation of Authority 
KLK has in place an organisational structure with formally 
defined responsibility lines and authorities to facilitate quick 
response to changes in the evolving business environment, 
effective supervision of day-to-day business conduct and 
accountability for operation performance. Capital and 
non-capital expenditures and acquisition and disposal of 
investment interest are subject to appropriate approval 
processes. The limit of authorities for approval levels 
is established for budgeted and non-budgeted capital 
expenditure.
Performance Management Framework
Management reports are generated on a monthly and 
consistent basis to facilitate the Board and the Group’s 
Management in performing financial and operation reviews 
on the various operating units. The reviews encompass 
areas such as financial and non-financial key performance 
indicators, variances between budget and operation  
results and compliance with laws and regulations.
The Group has in place a well-controlled budgeting  
process that provides a responsible accounting  
framework. The Group’s annual budget is approved by  
the Board prior to implementation.
Policies and Procedures
Documented policies and procedures form an integral  
part of the internal control systems to safeguard 
shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets against 
material losses and ensure complete and accurate  
financial information. These documents consist of  
approved memoranda, circulars, manuals and handbooks 
that are regularly revised and updated to meet operational 
needs.
Group Internal Audit 
The Internal Audit Division, which reports directly to the 
Audit and Risk Committee, conducts review on the system 
of internal controls and the effectiveness of the processes 
that are in place to identify, evaluate, manage and report 
risks. Their audit practices are guided by Professional 
Internal Auditing Standards as prescribed by the Institute  
of Internal Auditors, Malaysia. Routine reviews are  
conducted on units under the Group’s major core activities. 
Appropriate recommendations are made to address 
the issues and weaknesses highlighted and they are 
subsequently followed up to ensure proper implementation.
Whistleblowing 
A Whistleblowing Policy is in place to provide clarity of 
oversight of the whistleblowing process, protection and 
confidentiality to whistleblowers. The policy sets out a 
structured protocol for employees and stakeholders to 
raise genuine possibilities of improprieties, malpractices 
and misconduct within the Group for remedial action.

In addition, the Employee Grievance Policy is in place to 
provide a clear and transparent framework for employees 
to raise any grievances without fear of retaliation.  
Both policies are available on the Company’s website  
at www.klk.com.my.
Fraud Risk Management
The fraud risk management framework is in place to  
respond to possible fraud incidences or risks by conducting 
special and investigative reviews at the request of the 
Management. Complaints formally received through 
whistleblowing or grievance channels, as well as red 
flags identified through reviews are acted upon and taken  
through till resolution. The implementation of fraud 
management and strategies aim to minimise the  
incidences of fraud within the Group.
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (“ABAC”)
As a responsible corporation, the Group is committed 
to doing business with integrity. The employees  
and associated persons are guided by the Group’s  
Anti-Corruption Policy, which mandates professional, fair  
and ethical behaviour in all business dealings and 
relationships. The Group Donations and Sponsorships 
Policy, as well as Guidelines on Gifts, Benefits and 
Hospitality are in place as testimony of the Group’s 
commitment to conduct business in an honest and ethical 
manner. The Group also places emphasis on the business 
conduct of third parties who have dealings or transactions 
with the Group by requiring their adherence to the Code  
of Conduct for Suppliers, and the signing of Integrity 
Pledges. During the financial year under review, respective 
business units had participated in the ABAC Control  
Self-Assessment (CSA) to self-evaluate the effectiveness 
of oversight, risk management and controls implemented 
within their operations.
The Group’s ABAC Committee which reports to the COO, 
the ARC, and the Board, is responsible for overseeing  
the Group’s ABAC programmes. The ABAC Committee 
meets regularly to review the effectiveness of ABAC  
controls and compliance practices, with updates  
presented to the Board. It also continuously reviews, 
monitors, and enforces policies, controls, training and 
communications pertaining to anti-bribery and anti-
corruption.
Where applicable, the requirements of the Group’s  
existing policies, systems and procedures in relation to  
anti-bribery and anti-corruption are extended to the  
Group’s agents, counterparties and business partners 
to ensure that anti-corruption and bribery initiatives are 
applied throughout the Group’s supply chain. The Group is 
committed to fostering an anti-corruption culture through 
ABAC training, which includes annual refresher training  
for employees across all locations in which it operates,  
as well as induction training for all new employees.  
The Group will continue to foster an anti-corruption  
culture and adhere to the anti-corruption laws and 
regulations in countries in which it operates.
The Group’s stance in combating corruption is publicly 
available on the Company’s website at www.klk.com.my,  
via the Group Anti-Corruption Policy together with the 
Group’s Codes of Conduct and Ethics, Sustainability  
Policy and other relevant policies and procedures.
REVIEW OF STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The External Auditors have reviewed this Statement 
pursuant to the scope set out in the Audit and Assurance 
Practice Guide (“AAPG”) 3, Guidance for Auditors on 
Engagements to Report on Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control issued by the Malaysian Institute 
of Accountants for inclusion in the Annual Report of  
the Group for the year ended 30 September 2024, and 
reported to the Board that nothing has come to their 
attention that caused them to believe that the Statement 
intended to be included in the Annual Report of  
the Group, in all material aspects:
(a) has not been prepared in accordance with the  
disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of  
the Statement on Risk Management and Internal 
Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers; or 
(b) is factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the External Auditors to consider 
whether the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control covers all risks and controls, or to 
form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the Group’s risk management and internal control system 
including the assessment and opinion by the Board and 
Management thereon. The Auditors are also not required 
to consider whether the processes described to deal 
with material internal control aspects of any significant  
problems disclosed in the Annual Report will, in fact,  
remedy the problems.
CONCLUSION
The Board has reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness  
of the Group’s risk management and internal control  
system for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Annual  
Report. They are of the view that the risk management  
and internal control system is satisfactory and there were 
no material losses incurred during the year under review  
as a result of internal control weakness or adverse 
compliance events.
For the period under review, the Executive Chairman  
and Group Chief Financial Officer have provided  
assurance to the Board that the Group’s risk management 
and internal control system is operating adequately and 
effectively, in all material aspects.
This Statement was approved by the Board of Directors  
on 9 December 2024.

the efficiency and effectiveness for internal audit activities. 
Regular and systematic reviews on the effectiveness of  
key controls and processes in the operating units are 
conducted to provide reasonable assurance that such 
systems will continue to operate satisfactorily and  
effectively. 
Apart from the audit assignments in Malaysia, Indonesia, 
China, Europe and Liberia, IAD had also carried out 
investigations on specific areas as directed by the ARC  
and Management. The audit reports and investigation 
reports were submitted to the ARC on a quarterly 
basis. Periodic follow-up audits were carried out where  
appropriate to ensure recommendations for corrective 
actions were implemented and enforced. 
In addition, IAD had conducted in-house audit training 
for Auditors to enhance competencies and carried out 
training for the operating units’ personnel to enhance  
their awareness of internal controls.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Statement of compliance
The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards ("MFRSs"), IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia.  These financial statements also comply with the applicable disclosure provisions of the 
Listing Requirements of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.
The accounting policies adopted by the Group are consistent with those of the previous financial year 
except for the adoption of the following new MFRS and Amendments to the MFRSs, that were issued by 
the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board ("MASB").
Title Effective date

statements of the Group.
(i) Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial
Statements)

amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting
policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity -specific accounting policy information that users
need to understand other information in the financial statements.
These Amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies of the Group. The material
accounting policy information is disclosed in the respective notes to the financial statements where
relevant.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
(ii) International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to MFRS 112 Income Taxes)
and MFRS Application Implementation ( “MAIG”) 4 Determination of Announced Tax Rate as 
Substantively Enacted for Measurement of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The Amendments provide a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the top -up 
tax, which is effective immediately, and requirements about the Pillar Two exposure that are disclosed 
in Note 22 to the financial statements. 
The temporary mandatory relief applies retrospectively. These Amendments had no retrospective 
application and current year impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group as there 
was no new legislation enacted or substantively enacted to implement the top-up tax in the jurisdictions 
in which the Group operates.
The MFRS Application and Implementation Committee ( “MAIC”) issued MAIG 4 on 30 October 2023 
in response to clarifications sought arising from the implementation of Global Minimum Tax by the 
Malaysian Government in year 2025 announced during the Budget Announcement on 13 October 
2023. Based on MAIG 4, the MAIC concluded that the announced tax rates by the Malaysian 
Government is substantially enacted for the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities after 
the voting by the Members of the House of R epresentatives by a simple majority after the Third 
Reading.
New MFRSs and Amendments to MFRSs that have been issued by the MASB but have not been applied 
by the Group are:
Title Effective date
Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to MFRS 16 Leases) 1 January 2024
Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to MFRS 101
Presentation of Financial Statements) 1 January 2024
Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of
Financial Statements) 1 January 2024
Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7) 1 January 2024
Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to MFRS 121 The Effects of Changes in
Foreign Exchange Rates) 1 January 2025
Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments
(Amendments to MFRS 9 and MFRS 7) 1 January 2026
Annual Improvements to MFRS Accounting Standards - Volume 11 1 January 2026
MFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements 1 January 2027
MFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures 1 January 2027
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
(Amendments to MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and MFRS 128
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures) Deferred
The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting these Standards and Amendments to
MFRSs since the effects would only be observable in future financial years.
2.2 Basis of measurement

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company has carried out cash flows review for the next twelve (12) months from the date of financial 
statements are issued or approved to ensure that the business operations have sufficient liquidity and 
funds available to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. In addition, the Company also has the 
ability to secure financing from financial institutions, which could be readily available at the request of the

currency.  All financial information presented in RM has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless

estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods 
affected.

policies that have significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than those 
disclosed in Notes 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22 and 42 for measurement of the recoverable amounts of
property, plant and equipment , right-of-use assets, goodwill on consolidation, cost of investments, other 
receivables, deferred tax assets and the determination of fair value of identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed on business combination.

Revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated in Note 43 to the financial statements by 
geographical area.
(a) Revenue from contracts with customers
(i) Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods are recognised (net of discount and taxes collected on behalf) at the 
point in time when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer.  Depending on the 
terms of the contract with the customer, control transfers either upon delivery of the goods to a 
location specified by the customer and acceptance of the goods by the customer, or upon delivery of 
the goods on board vessels or tankers for onward delivery to the customers.
There is no right of return and warranty provided to the customers on the sale of goods.
There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of goods as the sales 
are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.
(ii) Property development
Contracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and are therefore accounted 
for as separate performance obligations.  In this case, the transaction price will be allocated to each 
separate performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices .  When these are not 
directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin.
The revenue from property development is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under 
sale and purchase agreement (“SPA”).
Revenue is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is 
probable that the Group will collect consideration to which it will be entitled to in exchange for the 
asset that would be transferred to the customer.  Depending on t he terms of the contract and the 
laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time.  
Control of the asset is transferred over time if the Group’s performance does not create an asset with 
an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for work 
performance completed todate.
If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract using 
the input method by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance 
obligation, i.e. based on the contract costs incurred todate to the estimated total costs for the contract. 
Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.
Significant judgement is required in determining performance obligations, transaction price 
allocation, costs in applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.
The Group identifies performance obligations that are distinct and material, which is judgmental in 
the context of contract. Transaction prices were determined based on estimated margins prior to its 
allocation to the identified performance obligation. The Group also estimated total contract costs in 
applying the input method to recognise revenue over time.
There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from property development as the 
contracts are on normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
The Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties, when the control 
of the properties has been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties have been 
completed and delivered to the customers and it is probable that the Group will collect the 
considerations to which it would be entitled to in exchange for the assets sold.
There is no significant financing component in the revenue arising from sale of completed properties 
as the sales are made on the normal credit terms not exceeding twelve months.
(iii) Rendering of services
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in profit or loss when the services are rendered.
(b) Other revenue
(i) Rental income
Rental income is recognised based on the accruals basis.
(ii) Interest income
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method in profit or loss except
for interest income arising from temporary investment of borrowings taken specifically for the purpose
of obtaining a qualifying asset , which is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy on
borrowing costs.
(iii) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Group's right to receive payment
is established.
In the case of the Group, revenue comprises sales to third parties only .

Recognition and measurement
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment 
are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Capital work-in-progress mainly comprised building and plant that are in the process of construction or 
completion.
Bearer plants are living plants that are used in the production or supply of agricultural produce, which are 
expected to bear produce for more than one period and have remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural 
produce, except for incidental scrap sales.  Costs include plantation expenditures incurred from the stage 
of land clearing up to the stage of maturity.  New planting expenditure and replanting expenditure are 
recognised as bearer plants and measured at cost less accumula ted amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any.
Depreciation
Freehold land has unlimited useful life and is not depreciated. Bearer plant and capital work-in-progress 
are not depreciated until such time when the asset is available for use.
Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost of the assets to their 
residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The principal annual depreciation 
rates are as follows:

Vehicles - 6.67% to 33% per annum
Equipment, fittings, etc. - 5% to 33.33% per annum
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at end of the reporting period and 
adjusted as appropriate.
Disposal of property, plant and equipment
The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and is recognised net 
within "other operating income" or "other operating expenses" respectively in profit or loss .
Impairment testing
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amounts with their 
recoverable amounts.  The recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment are determined based 
on value -in-use calculations using cash flow projection s from the financial budgets and forecasts 
approved by management covering periods ranging from five (5) years to twenty (20) years (2023: five 
(5) years to seventeen (17) years).
A subsidiary used cash flow projections covering periods of up to twenty (20) years (2023: seventeen (17) 
years) due to long period of gestation of their businesses.
The key assumptions for the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 1 5 to the financial statements.
Impairment losses
Impairment losses on property, plant and equipmentof RM2,440,000 (2023: RM27,821,000) was included 
in administrative expense.  The impairment was due to cessation of operations and under performance
of operations.
Write-back of impairment loss of RM4,568,000 (2023: Nil) during the financial year was included in other 
operating income.  The write-back was due to better performance of operations.

Impairment testing on assets in KL-Kepong Rubber Products Sdn Bhd (“KLKRP”)
The Group has carried out an impairment assessment on property, plant and equipment and right-of-use 
assets of KLKRP with a carrying amount of RM 291.0 million (2023: RM304.9 million) in view of its 
continued losses.
The impairment assessment is determined based on cash flow forecasts approved by management 
covering a period up to fifteen (15) years applying the following key assumptions:
(i) Growth rates and forecasted margins based on management’s estimate of the industry trends and 
historical performance; and
(ii) A pre-tax discount rate of 7.3% (2023: 6.2%), which reflects the specific risks relating to the assets.
Based on the impairment assessment, no impairment is required for the assets related to KLKRP. There 
are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions used that would cause the carrying 
amount of the assets to materially exceed the recoverable amount.
Security
Certain property, plant and equipment of the Group with a total carrying amount of RM136,128,000 (2023: 
RM145,441,000) as at end of the financial year were charged to banks as security for borrowings ( Note 
35).
Property, plant and equipment subject to operating lease
Certain freehold land, buildings, plant and machinery of the Group are leased out to third parties.  These 
leases are classified as operating lease because they do not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to the ownership of these assets.

The Group leases various land, offices and equipment.  Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis 
and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
Recognition and measurement and depreciation
Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liabilities 
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date of the leases.
After initial recognition, right -of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on the straight-line basis over the earlier of the estimated useful lives 
of the right -of-use assets or the end of the lease term. The lease terms of right -of-use assets are as 
follows:
Leasehold land - 5 to 931 years (2023: 4 to 931 years)
Land use rights - 8 to 99 years (2023: 4 to 99 years)
Buildings - 1 to 30 years
Plant and machinery - 1 to 20 years
Others - 3 to 5 years
Recognition exemption
All leases are accounted for by recognising right-of-use assets and lease liabilities except for:
(i) leases of low value assets; and
(ii) leases with a duration of 12 months or less.
Restriction imposed by lease
The lease agreements for the leasehold land do not allow the Group to assign, transfer or sublease or 
create any charge, lien or trust in respect of or dispose of the whole or any part of the land with third party 
interest(s) without the prior consent of the lessor.
Impairment testing
Impairment testing on right-of-use assets similar to that of property, plant and equipment as disclosed in 
Note 11 to the financial statements.

Investment properties are properties, which are held to earn rental yields or for capital appreciation or for 
both and are not occupied by the Group. Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including 
transaction costs and borrowing costs if the investment propert ies meet the definition of qualifying asset. 
After initial recognition, investment propert ies are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
Investment properties comprise car park lot that is leased to a third party and shopping centre under 
construction that include freehold land and building under construction.
A subsidiary has entered into commercial property leases on its car park. The subsidiary has determined 
that it retains all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties , which are leased out 
as operating leases due to the immateriality of the lease period over the investment properties’ economic 
life.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of the investment property to its residual value on a straight 
line basis over its estimated useful live. Freehold land and buildings under construction are not 
depreciated. Leasehold land are depreciated over a lease term of 97 years.

Car park at Level 3 fair value measurements were recommended by the Directors as at the end of the 
reporting period based on internal valuation performed by management, using comparison approach ,
which made reference to observable market price from recent sales of comparable properties.
Fair value for shopping centre under construction is not available as the fair value of the work in progress 
building is unable to be reliably measured given the range of estimates involved during the construction 
phase, including the term yield, reversion yield and price per square foot.
Rental income generated from rental car park of the Group during the financial year amounted to RM6,000 
(2023: Nil).
Direct operating expenses arising from car park generating rental income during the financial year 
amounted to RM8,000 (2023: Nil).

Inventories of developed properties held for sale are stated at the lower of costs and net realisable value.  
Costs consist of costs associated with the acquisition of land, direct costs and appropriate proportions of 
common costs attributable to developing the properties to completion.
Inventories of produce, stores and materials are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring these 
inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing 
location and condition.
Inventories of nursery consist of seedlings remaining in the nursery for eventual field planting and are 
stated at the lower of costs and net realisable value.  Cost of seeds and seedlings includes the cost of 
treatment and cultivation.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
The Group writes down its obsolete or slow moving inventories based on assessments of their estimated 
net selling price.  Inventories are written down when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amounts could not be recovered.  Management specifically analyses sales trend and current 
economic trends when making this judgement to evaluate the adequacy of the write down for obsolete or 
slow moving inventories.
During the financial year, net inventories losses amounting to RM50. 8 million were identified at a 
subsidiary, in respect of which Management has made the requisite accounting adjustments.
Management has also commissioned an independent external party for the conduct of a comprehensive 
review to, amongst others, identify the cause of the losses. As at date of this report, the review is still on-
going.
Inventories previously written down to net realisable values are reversed during the financial year as the 
inventories were sold above the carrying amounts.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of foreign operation on or after 1 January 2006 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and are recorded in the functional currency 
of the foreign operations and translated in accordance with the accounting policies for foreign currencies.
Allocation of goodwill
Goodwill has been allocated to the cash -generating unit ("CGU") of the Group that has been identified 
according to business segments as follows:
Group
2024
RM'000
2023
RM'000
Plantation 160,750 138,436
Manufacturing 204,133 213,286
Property development 3 3
364,886 351,725
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated from the acquisition date, to each of the CGU 
of the Group that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the carrying amount with the 
recoverable amount. The Directors are of the opinion that since all CGUs are held on a long -term basis, 
the value-in-use would best reflect their recoverable amount. Value-in-use is determined by discounting 
future cash flows over five (5) years period. Future cash flows are based on business plans, which is the 
best estimate of future performance. The ability to achieve the business plan targets is a key assumption 
in determining the recoverable amount for each CGU.
There remains a risk that the ability to achieve these business plans of the management may be adversely 
affected due to unforeseen changes in the respective economies in which the CGUs operate.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are:
(i) the pre-tax discount rates, which are the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks 
relating to relevant segments.  The discount rates used ranged from 5.2% to 7.5% (2023: 6.2% to 
8.3%);
(ii) the growth rate used for the plantation companies is determined based on the management's 
estimate of commodity prices, palm yields, oil extraction rates as well as cost of production whilst 
growth rates of companies in other segments are determined based on the industry trends and past 
performances of the respective companies; and
(iii) profit margins are projected based on historical profit margin achieved.

Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost of the assets to their residual values on a straight line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The principal amortisation periods are as follows:
Trademarks - 6 to 15 years
Patents - 6 to 20 years
Technology related assets - 5 years
Customer lists - 15 to 20 years
The residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period.
The amortisation of intangible assets amounting to RM1,640,000 (2023: RM1,973,000) and RM5,890,000
(2023: RM3,497,000) are included in cost of sales and administration expenses respectively.
Impairment loss
In previous financial year, the Group recognised an impairment loss amounting to RM44,000 based on 
value-in-use method to bring the carrying amount to its recoverable amount due to cessation of operations.

difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts is included in profit or loss.
All components of non-controlling interests shall be initially measured at fair value on the acquisition date, 
unless another measurement basis is required by MFRS. The choice of the measurement basis is made 
on a combination-by-combination basis. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of the non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity.

(b) Management reviews the investments in subsidiaries for impairment when there is an indication of
impairment. Recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are assessed by reference to the
fair value less cost to sell of the underlying assets or the value-in-use of the respective subsidiaries. Value-
in-use is the net present value of the projected future cash flows derived from business operations of the
respective subsidiaries discounted at an appropriate pre -tax discount rate. This discounted cash flows
method involves the use of estimated future results and a set of assumptions to support their income and
cash flows. Significant judgements and estimates were used to determine the key assumptions applied
to the cash flow projections, which includes the growth rates and the appropriate pre -tax discount rates
used for each of the subsidiary. Impairment losses are made when the carrying amount of the investments
in subsidiaries exceed its recoverable amount.
Impairment testing on cost of investment in KLK Agro Plantations Pte Ltd ("KLKAP"), a wholly -
owned subsidiary
KLKAP is the holding company of a plantation subsidiary in Liberia, Liberian Palm Developments Limited.
In the previous financial year, the Company had recognised an additional impairment loss on investment
in KLKAP amounting to RM82.9 million to bring the carrying amount to its recoverable amount of RM127.2
million (net of impairment loss of RM291.6 million due to under performance of operations and recognised
based on the value-in-use calculation of the plantation subsidiary in Liberia).
The key assumptions for the impairment testing are disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.
(c) During the financial year, the Company recognised a reversal of impairment amounting to RM 920,000 in
conjunction with the part disposal of the subsidiary.
(d) The amount due from a subsidiary is deemed as capital contribution to th is subsidiary as the repayment
of this amount is neither fixed nor expected.
(e) Impairment for capital contribution to a subsidiary is recognised based on the general approach within
MFRS 9 using the forward looking expected credit loss model as disclosed in Note 25 to the financial
statements.
(f) No expected credit loss is recognised arising from capital contribution to subsidiary of the Company as it
is negligible.

Impairment testing on investment in Synthomer
As at 30 September 202 4, the market value of the Group’s investment in Synthomer amounted to 
RM538.5 million, which was lower than its gross carrying amount of RM2,411.8 million (2023: RM2,179.4
million). Management has performed an impairment assessment to determine the recoverable amount 
of the investment based on value-in-use calculations.
Based on impairment assessment performed, an impairment loss for investment in Synthomer of 
RM180.0 million (2023: Nil) was recognised and included in admin istrative expenses. The impairment 
was mainly due to under performance of operations in Synthomer.
The value assigned to the key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations represent management’s 
assessment of future trends and are based on internal and external sources of data, where available.
The value-in-use calculations are prepared using cash flow forecast from approved financial budgets and 
forecasts with the following key assumptions:
(i) Cash flow projections covering a period of 5 years;
(ii) Pre-tax discount rate of 9.2% (2023: 8.8%);
(iii) Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) growth rates ranging from
7.0% to 28.0% (2023: -35.0% to 47.0%); and
(iv) Terminal growth rate of 2.1% (2023: 2.1%).
The sensitivity analysis of each of these key assumptions assuming all other variables are held constant 
are as follows:

Deferred tax assets include an amount of RM 157,388,000 (2023: RM 116,016,000), which relates to 
unutilised tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances of certain subsidiaries that suffered losses in the 
current and previous financial years.  The Group has concluded that the deferred tax assets are 
recoverable through estimated future taxable profits based on the approved business plans and budgets 
of these subsidiaries.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
The amount and availability of these items to be carried forward up to the periods as disclosed above are 
subject to the agreement of the respective local and foreign tax authorities. Unutilised tax losses of the 
holding company and subsidiaries incorporated in Malaysia can be carried forward up to 10 consecutive 
years of assessment immediately following the year of assessment under the tax legislation of Inland 
Revenue Board.
Unutilised tax losses of certain foreign subsidiaries amounting to RM 19,959,000 (2023: RM20,338,000)
are available for carry forward in the jurisdiction in which the foreign subsidiaries operate for a period of 5
years to 7 years respectively from the year in which those tax losses arose.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been provided by a subsidiary on the taxable temporary differences as the 
taxable temporary differences are expected to be reversed during the pioneer status period of 10 years 
commencing from year of assessment 2022 when the subsidiary would not be subject to income tax.
The Group has tax losses carried forward of RM999,556,000 (2023: RM800,632,000), which give rise to 
the recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses above, which are 
subject to agreement by the tax authorities.
The Group is within the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”)
Pillar Two model rules. During the Budget Announcement on 13 October 2023, the Minister of Finance 
announced that the Pillar Two rules would be implemented in Malaysia in 2025 and that the Government 
will continue to observe international developments on this area. Since the Pillar Two legislation has not 
been enacted in Malaysia, the jurisdiction in which the Group is incorporated, and was not effective at the 
end of the reporting period, the Group has no related cur rent tax exposure. The Group applies the 
exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to 
Pillar Two income taxes.
Under the legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top -up tax for the difference between the Pillar Two 
effective tax rate for each jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. The Group is in the process of assessing 
its exposure to the Pillar Two legislation for when it comes into effect.
Due to uncertainties surrounding when and how each jurisdiction will enact the legislations, the 
quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable.
The Group is currently engaged with tax specialists to assist them with applying the legislation.

The biological assets of the Group and of the Company comprise:
(a) Unharvested fresh fruit bunches ("FFB")
The agriculture produce growing on bearer plants of the Group comprises fresh fruit bunches ("FFB") prior 
to harvest and are measured at fair value less costs to sell under biological assets.  Any gains or losses 
arising from changes in fair value less c osts to sell of the produce are recognised within cost of sales in 
profit or loss.
Management has deliberated on the oil content of such unharvested FFB and concluded that since the oil 
content of unharvested FFB accrues exponentially only from 15 days prior to harvest, such unharvested 
FFB more than 15 days prior to harvest are excluded from valuation as their fair values are considered 
negligible.  Therefore, quantity of unharvested FFB up to 15 days prior to harvest is used for valuation 
purpose.  The fair value of unharvested FFB is determined based on market approach, which takes into 
consideration the market prices of FFB and crude palm oil, where appropriate, adjusted to the estimated 
oil content of unharvested FFB, less harvesting, transport and other costs to sell.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
During the financial year, the Group and the Company harvested approximately 5.50 million mt (2023: 
5.25 million mt) and 1.1 million mt (2023: 1.0 million mt) of FFB respectively.  The quantity of unharvested 
FFB of the Group and of the Company as at 30 September 2024 included in the fair valuation of 
unharvested FFB was 232,731 mt (2023: 243,430 mt) and 50,550 mt (2023: 49,605 mt) respectively.
If the FFB selling price changes by 5%, profit or loss for the Group and the Company would have equally 
increased or decreased by approximately RM10.0 million (2023: RM9.2 million) and RM2.5 million (2023:
RM2.2 million) respectively.
If the quantity of unharvested FFB changes by 5%, profit or loss for the Group and the Company would 
have equally increased or decreased by approximately RM 10.1 million (2023: RM9.2 million) and RM2.5
million (2023: RM2.2 million) respectively.
(b) Livestock
Livestock is measured at fair value less point-of-sale cost, with any change therein recognised in profit or 
loss.  Fair value is based on the market price of livestock of similar age, breed and genetic make -up.  
Point-of-sale costs include all costs that would be necessary to sell the livestock.
Livestock mainly comprises sheep and cattle.
During the financial year, the Group produced 7,131 (2023: 10,190) sheep and 390 (2023: 464) cattle.  
The quantity of sheep and cattle of the Group as at 30 September 2024 included in the fair valuation of 
livestock was 21,052 head (2023: 26,497 head) and 947 head (2023: 1,268 head) respectively.
(c) Growing crops
Growing crops are measured at fair value, which is based on the costs incurred to the end of the reporting 
period for these crops. As at the end of the reporting period, the yield of the crops and the future economic 
benefits, which will flow from the crops are not fully determinable and costs incurred in relation to the crops 
are considered to be reasonable approximation of fair value at the date.
Growing crops mainly comprise wheat, canola, barley and lupins.
During the financial year, the Group harvested 42,804 mt (2023: 60,863 mt) of wheat, 15,065 mt (2023:
29,753 mt) of canola, 890 mt (2023: 6,307 mt) of barley and 6,441 mt (2023: 2,789 mt) of lupins.  Area of 
crops sown for the financial year were 23,680 hectares (202 3: 24,212 hectares) for wheat, 10,371 
hectares (2023: 9,351 hectares) for canola, 3,370 hectares (202 3: 1,814 hectares) for barley and 868
hectares (2023: 1,770 hectares) for lupins.
Sensitivity analysis for changes in volume of growing crops is not disclosed as the effect is immaterial to 
the Group.
The fair value of the Group and of the Company’s biological assets, which are estimated using 
unobservable inputs , is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy with the exception of 
livestock, which are on Level 2 (inputs are observable indirectly) .  Fair value assessments have been 
completed consistently using the same valuation techniques.
There were no transfers between all 3 levels of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year (2023: no 
transfer in either directions).
None of the biological assets of the Group and of the Company as at 30 September 2024 and 2023 were 
pledged as securities.

2,130,807 2,268,228 28,518 26,744
Included in the trade receivables of the Group are amounts owing by related parties of RM57,044,000
(2023: RM54,913,000).
Impairment for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are recognised 
based on the simplified approach using the lifetime expected credit loss (“ECL”).
Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the asset, 
while 12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that result from default events that are possible within the 
twelve (12) months after the reporting date. The maximum period considered when estimating ECL is the 
maximum contractual period over which the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk.
During this process, the probability of non-payment by the trade receivables is adjusted by forward looking 
information and multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime 
ECL for the trade receivables.
The Group considers available, reasonable and supportive forward -looking information, which includes 
the following indicators:
(i) Internal credit rating/assessment;
(ii) External credit rating/assessment (where available);
(iii) Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the debtor (where available);
(iv) Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are
expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligation;
(v) Significant increase in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; and
(vi) Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtor, including changes in
the payment status of debtors in the group and changes in the operating results of the debtor.

No expected credit loss is recognised arising from the trade receivables of the Company as the amount 
is negligible.
The allowance account in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses , which were 
included in net impairment losses on financial assets .  Unless the Group is satisfied that the recovery of 
the amount is possible, the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against the receivable directly.
The Group's and the Company’s normal trade credit term ranges from 5 to 150 (2023: 5 to 150) days and 
7 to 60 (2023: 7 to 60) days respectively.  Other credit terms are assessed and approved on a case -by-

In prior year, included in the refundable deposits of the Group and of the Company was deposit payment 
of RM229,200,000 for the proposed acquisition of shares in a quoted investment, which was subsequently 
terminated and this deposit was fully refunded in financial year ended 30 September 2024.
Impairment for other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint 
ventures are recognised based on the general approach within MFRS 9 using ECL model. The 
methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment is based on whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset by comparing the risk of 
default occurring over the expected life with the risk of default since initial recognition.  
For balances in which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition of the financial 
asset, 12-month ECL along with gross interest income are recognised.  For balances in which credit risk 
has increased significantly, lifetime ECL along with the gross interest income are recognised.  For those 
that are determined to be credit impaired, lifetime ECL along with interest income on a net basis are 
recognised.
The probabilities of non-payments by other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, amounts owing by 
subsidiaries and joint ventures are adjusted by forward looking information and multiplied by the amounts 
of the expected losses arising from defaults to determine the 12 -month or lifetime ECL for the other 
receivables, financial guarantee contracts, amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group defined significant increase in credit risk based on operating performance of the receivables, 
changes to contractual terms, payment delays more than 30 days past due in making contractual 
payments and past due information.
It requires management to exercise significant judgement in determining the probabilities of default by 
other receivables, financial guarantee contracts, amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint ventures, 
appropriate forward looking information and significant increase in credit risk.

Contract assets and contract liabilities represent the timing differences in revenue recognition and the 
milestone billings.  The milestone billings are structured and/or negotiated with customers to reflect 
physical completion of the contracts.
Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights to economic benefits become unconditional.  
This usually occurs when the Group issues billing s to the customers.  Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.

Current liabilities 22,590 26,034 24,378 19,234
368,751 181,129 101,445 60,914
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the contractual payments due to the lessor over the 
lease term, with the discount rate determined by reference to the rate implicit in the lease unless (as is 
typically the case) this is not readily determin able, in which case the Group’s incremental borrowing rate 
on commencement of the lease is used. The incremental borrowing rates used are based on prevailing 
market borrowing rates over similar lease terms, of similar value as the right -of-use asset in a s imilar 
economic environment.
Variable lease payments are only included in the measurement of the lease liability if they depend on an 
index or rate.  In such cases, the initial measurement of the lease liability assumes the variable element 
will remain unchanged throughout the lease term.  Other variable lease payments are expensed in the 
period to which they relate.
On initial recognition, the carrying value of the lease liability also includes:
(i) amounts expected to be payable under any residual value guarantee;
(ii) the exercise price of any purchase option granted in favour of the Group if it is reasonably certain to
exercise that option;  and
(iii) any penalties payable for terminating the lease, if the term of the lease has been estimated on the
basis of termination option being exercised.
Subsequent to initial measurement, lease liabilities increase as a result of interest charged at a constant 
rate on the balance outstanding and are reduced for lease payments made.
In determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option.  Extension options (or 
periods after termination options) are only inclu ded in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to 
be extended (or not to be terminated).
The Group reassesses the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in 
circumstances that is within the control of the Group and affects whether the Group is reasonably certain 
to exercise an option not previously included in the deter mination of lease term, or not to exercise an 
option previously included in the determination of lease term.  A revision in the lease term results in a 
remeasurement of lease liabilities.

Some lease contracts contain variable payment terms that are linked to performance of the underlying 
right-of-use assets.
Variable lease payments that depend on performance of the underlying right-of-use assets are recognised 
in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs. Sensitivity 
analysis for variable lease payments is not disclosed as the effect is immaterial to the Group.
Several lease contracts of the Group include extension and termination options.  These are used to 
maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations.  
Management exercises significant judgement in determining whether these extension and terminati on 
options are reasonably certain to be exercised.
The possibility for the Group to exercise the termination options is unlikely after taking into consideration 
of relevant facts and circumstances including past experience, cost and economic incentive that will be 
involved to exercise the termination options.

Defined benefit obligations
(i) The Group's plantation operations in Malaysia operate defined benefit plans based on the terms of the
union's collective agreements in Malaysia.  These retirement benefit plans are unfunded.  The benefits
payable to all eligible employees on retirement arebased on the last drawn salaries, the length of
service and the rates set out in the union's collective agreements.
The present value of these unfunded defined benefit obligations as required by MFRS 119 Employee
Benefits has not been used in arriving at the provision as the amount involved is insignificant to the
Group and the Company.  The undiscounted value of these unfunded defined benefit obligations was
RM39,879,000 (2023: RM43,462,000) for the Group and RM 38,218,000 (2023: RM41,749,000) for
the Company as at 30 September 202 4.  Accordingly, no further disclosures as required by the
standard are made.
(ii) All the plantation subsidiaries in Indonesia operate unfunded defined benefit plans for all its eligible
employees in accordance with the Labour Law in Indonesia.  The obligations of the retirement benefit
plans are calculated as the present values of obligations at end of the reporting period using the
projected unit credit method, which is based on the last drawn salaries at the end of the reporting
period, age and the length of service.
(iii) Subsidiaries in Germany and Italy, KLK Emmerich GmbH and KLK Temix S.p.A. (formerly known as
Temix Oleo S.p.A .), operate unfunded retirement benefit plans for their eligible employees.  The
obligations of the retirement benefit plans are determined annually by independent qualified actuaries.
The discount rate is determined using the yield of first class corporatebonds at the valuation date and
in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The last actuarial valuations were
on 30 September 2024.
(iv) The subsidiaries in Switzerland operate a funded defined benefit pension scheme for employees.  The
assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the subsidiary.
The calculation of the funded defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary
using the projected unit credit method.  When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group,
the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any
future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.  To calculate the present
value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
The Group determines the net interest expense or income on the net defined liability or asset for the
period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning
of the annual period to the then net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes
in the net defined benefit liability or asset during the period as a result of contributions and benefit
payments.
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit
that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the
settlement occurs.
Arising from the internal restructuring of the subsidiaries in Switzerland, Kolb Distribution AG and Dr.
W. Kolb AG ("Kolb Group") in Europe in financial year 2019, Kolb Group restructured their funded
defined benefit plan on 1 January 2020 by transferring all active members and pensioners to a
collective pension foundation (“Foundation”) , which guarantees the mandatory minimum benefits
defined by the Swiss law and is responsible for the investment of the assets for a period of at least 5
years from 1 January 2020 to at least 31 December 2024.
In previous financial year, the reduction of RM1,058,000 in the defined benefit plan obligation , which 
was disclosed as negative past service cost arose from changes of assumption used by pension fund.
This funded defined benefit obligation is determined by an independent qualified actuary on an annual 
basis.  The last actuarial valuation was on 30 September 2024.

43. SEGMENT INFORMATION – GROUP
The Group has five (5) reportable segments, which are the Group's strategic business units.  The strategic 
business units offer different products and are managed separately as they require different technology 
and marketing strategies.  The Group's Executive Chairman reviews internal management reports of each 
of the strategic business units on a monthly basis.
Operating segment results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, which in this 
case is the Executive Chairman of the Group, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the 
segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
The reportable segments are summarised below:
Plantation Cultivation and processing of palm and rubber products
Manufacturing Manufacturing of oleochemicals, non-ionic surfactants and esters, rubber gloves, 
parquet flooring products, pharmaceutical products , storing and distribution of 
bulk liquid, refining of palm products, kernel crushing and trading of palm products
Property development Development of residential and commercial properties
Investment holding Placement of deposits with licensed banks, investment in money market funds,
investment in quoted and unquoted corporations and speciality chemicals 
manufacturing by an associate
Others Farming and management services
Inter-segment pricing is determined based on negotiated terms in a manner similar to transactions with 
third parties.
The accounting policies of operating segments are the same as those described in the respective notes 
to the financial statements. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax as included in 
the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group's Executive Chairman.  Segment profit 
is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in 
evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate with these industries.
These policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and previous financial years.
Segment assets exclude tax assets.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities.

At end of the year 12,676 11,898 8,075 7,297
There were no transfers between all three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.
Fair value of an asset or a liability, except for lease transactions, is determined as the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date.  The me asurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer 
the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market.
The Group measures the fair value of an asset or a liability by taking into account the characteristics of 
the asset or liability if market participants would take these characteristics into account when pricing the 
asset or liability. The Group has considered the following characteristics when determining fair value:
(i) the condition and location of the asset; and
(ii) restrictions, if any, on the sale or use of the asset.
For non-financial asset, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant's ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.
The following summarises the methods used in determining the fair values of financial instruments 
reflected in the above table.
Level 1 Fair Value
Investments in quoted shares and commodities future contracts
The fair values of investments that are quoted in an active market and commodities future contracts are 
determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the end of the reporting period.
Money market funds
The fair value of money market funds is based on quoted price of the funds at the end of the reporting 
period.
Level 2 Fair Value
Forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swap contracts and commodities swap 
contracts
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swap contracts and commodities swap 
contracts are based on their quoted price at the end of the reporting period.

Level 3 Fair Value
Financial instruments not carried at fair value
Fair value of the following financial instruments not carried at fair value, which is determined for disclosure 
purposes, is calculated based on present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the end of the reporting date:
- Other receivables 
- Borrowings
- Amounts owing by subsidiaries
Fair value of other unquoted investments is estimated based on adjusted net asset method.
Transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 fair values
There has been no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 fair values during the financial year (2023: no 
transfer in either directions).
(d) Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including foreign currency risk, interest rate 
risk, price fluctuation risk, credit risk and liquidity and cash flow risk. The Group’s overall financial risk 
management objective is to ensure that the Group creates value for its shareholders whilst minimising 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance and positions. The Group operates within an 
established risk management framework and clearly defined guidelines that are approved by the Board 
of Directors.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from the use of financial instruments:
- Credit risk
- Liquidity risk
- Market risk
(e) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument 
fails to meet its contractual obligations.  The Group ’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from its 
receivables from customers , investment securities and derivative assets used for hedging.  The 
Company’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries and financial 
guarantees given to banks for credit facilities granted to subsidiaries.
(i) Receivables
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is monitored on an on -going 
basis.  Credit worthiness review is regularly performed for new customers and existing customers 
who trade on credit, to mitigate exposure on credit risk.  Where appropriate, the Group requires its 
customers to provide collateral before approvals are given to trade on credit.
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether any of the receivables are credit impaired.
The gross carrying amounts of credit impaired receivables are written off (either partially or fully) when 
there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that 
the debtors does not have assets or sources o f income that could generate sufficient cash flows to 
repay the amount subject to the write -off. Nevertheless, receivables that are written off could still be 
subject to enforcement activities.
There are no significant changes as compared to previous year.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from receivables is 
represented by the carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.
Management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor 
impaired are stated at their realisable values.  A significant portion of these receivables are regular 
customers that have been transacting with the Group.  The Group uses ageing analysis to monitor 
the credit quality of the receivables.  Any receivables having significant balances past due the agreed 
credit periods, which are deemed to have higher credit risk, are monitored individually.
Other than other receivables as disclosed at Note 21 to the financial statements , none of the 
receivables are secured by financial guarantees given by banks, shareholders or directors of the 
customers.
The Group and Company do not have any significant exposure to any individual customer.
(ii) Investments and other financial assets
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a credit rating 
equal to or better than the Group.  Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with 
approved financial institutions.
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group invested in both domestic and overseas securities.  
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the statement s of
financial position.
In view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, management does not expect any counterparty 
to fail to meet its obligations.
The investments and other financial assets are unsecured.
(iii) Financial guarantees
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted 
to plasma plantation projects.
The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities 
granted to certain subsidiaries. The Company monitors on an on going basis the results of the 
subsidiaries and repayments made by the subsidiaries.
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at end of the reporting period, there was no indication that any plasma plantation projects or 
subsidiary would default on repayment. The maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial 
guarantee contracts provided as credit enhancements is represented by the outstanding banking 
facilities of the subsidiaries, if any, as at the end of the reporting period.
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss of financial guarantee contracts
The Group and the Company assume that there is a significant increase in credit risk when the 
financial position of the subsidiaries deteriorate significantly. The Group and the Company consider 
a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when:
(a) the subsidiaries are unlikely to repay its credit obligation to the bank in full; or
(b) the subsidiaries are continuously loss making and is having a deficit shareholders’ fund.
The Group and the Company determine the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually 
using internal information available.

(Continued)
The financial guarantees have not been recognised since the fair value was not material.
Maturity profile of financial guarantee contracts of the Group and of the Company at the end of each 
reporting period based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations is repayable upon any 
default by the plasma plantation projects or subsidiaries in respect of the guaranteed bank facilities.
(iv) Inter-company balances
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries.  The Company monitors the 
results of the subsidiaries regularly.
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their 
carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
(f) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.  
The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings.
The Group mainta ins sufficient levels of cash and cash equivalents and adequate amounts of credit 
facilities to meet its working capital requirements.  In addition, the Group strives to maintain flexibility in 
funding by keeping its credit lines available at a reasonable level.  As far as possible, the G roup raises 
funding from financial institutions and prudently balances its portfolio with some short and long term 
funding so as to achieve overall cost effectiveness.
While the Company is in a net current liabilities position as at 30 September 2024, the Group has RM607.0
million in undrawn credit facilities. The Company expects to achieve further liquidity position improvement 
and has certain plans to improve the cash flows of the Company, which are currently in the progress, 
amongst others:
(i) positive cash flows generated from operations;
(ii) dividend income from its subsidiaries; and
(iii) disposal of a piece of land of the Company as disclosed in Note 46 to the financial statements.
Based on the above plans, the Directors are of the opinion that the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk is 
appropriately mitigated.
At the end of the reporting period, approximately 43% and 16% (2023: 29% and 4%) of the Group’s and 
of the Company’s loans and borrowings will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount 
reflected in the financial statements.
It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or 
at significantly different amounts.

(g) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and 
other prices that will affect the Group’s financial position or cash flows.
(i) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, inter -company advances and 
borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of 
Group entities.  The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily United States Dollar ( "USD"), 
Pound Sterling ( "GBP"), Euro, Australian Dollar ( "AUD"), Singapore Dollar ( "SGD"), Indonesian 
Rupiah ("Rp"), Japanese Yen ("JPY") and Renminbi (“Rmb”).
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
Foreign currencies exposures of the Group are hedged through forward exchange contracts.  Most 
of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the end of the reporting 
period.  Where necessary, the forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.
Exposure to foreign currency risk

A 5% weakening of the functional currencies of the Group entities against the foreign currencies at 
the end of the reporting period would have equal but opposite effect on profit after tax and equity.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes 
in interest rates.  The Group’s floating rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows 
due to changes in interest rates.  Money market funds , deposits with licensed banks, short term 
receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group through its Treasury Committee reviews the funding requirements for its business 
operations and capital expenditure and adopts a policy to secure an appropriate mix of fixed and 
floating rate exposure suitable for the Group.
To achieve this objective, the Group has obtained the most competitive cost of capital through the 
issuance of Islamic Medium Term Notes, long term and short term borrowings and trade financing 
facilities.
Exposure to interest rate risk
The interest rate profile of the Group ’s and the Company ’s significant interest -bearing financial 
instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period was:

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge 
accounting model.  Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would not 
affect profit or loss.

A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would have 
increased/(decreased) profit after tax and equity by the amounts shown below.  The analysis

(iii) Debt and equity price risk
Debt and equity price risk arises from the Group’s investments in debt and equity securities.
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
Management of the Group monitors the equity investments on a portfolio basis.  Material investments 
within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all material buy and sell decisions are 
approved by the Board of Directors.
Debt and equity price risk sensitivity analysis
The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 5% increase in debt and equity prices at the end of the reporting period would have increased the 
Group’s and the Company’s equity by RM37,632,000 (2023: RM36,667,000) and Nil (2023:
RM843,000) respectively. A 5% decrease in debt and equity prices would have equal but opposite 
effect on equity.
(iv) Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to price fluctuation risk on commodities mainly of palm oil and rubber.
Risk management objectives, policy and processes for managing the risk
The prices of these commodities are subject to fluctuations due to uncontrollable factors such as 
weather, global demand and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Group mitigates 
the risk to the price volatility through hedging in the futures market and where deemed prudent, the 
Group sells forward in the physical market.
Commodity price risk sensitivity analysis
A 5% increase/(decrease) of the commodities price at the end of the reporting period, with all other 
variables held constant, would have increased/(decreased) profit after tax and equity by the amounts 
shown below:

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the year.
Under the requirement of Bursa Malaysia Practice Note No. 17/2005, the Company is required to maintain 
a consolidated shareholders' equity of more than 25% of the issued and paid -up capital (excluding 
treasury shares) and such shareholders' equity is not less than RM40 million.  The Company has complied 
with this requirement.
The Group is not subject to any other externally imposed capital requirements other than as disclosed in 
Note 35 to the financial statements.
46. EVENT SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD
On 30 October 2024, the Company (“KLK”) via its wholly-owned subsidiary, KLK Land Sdn Bhd (“KLKL”), 
entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement (“SHA”) with AME Industrial Park Sdn Bhd (“AMEIP”), a company 
principally involved in investment holding and property development, and Oasis Innovation Sdn Bhd 
(“Oasis Innovation”), wherein KLKL and AMEIP hold 40% and 60% equity interest respectively therein, to 
jointly undertake an industrial development on a parcel of freehold land (with a net development area of 
approximately 151.2 acres) in the State of Selangor (“Joint Development”).
Upon completion of SHA, Oasis Innovation becomes an associate of the Group.
The Joint Development is premised on the acquisition by Oasis Innovation from KLK of a parcel of freehold 
land together with the oil palm trees planted thereon (measuring approximately 178.0 acres) for RM230.5 
million in Mukim Ijok, Daerah Kuala Selangor, Negeri Selangor.
AME Development Sdn Bhd will oversee the Joint Development as project manager.
The Joint Development will enable KLK to unlock the value of the Group’s property development potential 
in Peninsular Malaysia. The Joint Development with AMEIP allows KLKL to leverage AMEIP’s extensive 
experience, ensuring a successful and strategic expansion into industrial property development.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, the SHA shall be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2024 
and the acquisition of freehold land from KLK shall be completed in the third quarter of calendar year 
2025, upon KLK’s receipt of the purchase price for the land.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF KUALA LUMPUR KEPONG BERHAD
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad, which comprise the statements of 
financial position as at 30 September 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or 
loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of 
the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, 
including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 150 to 248.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
Group and of the Company as at 30 September 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows 
for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRSs"), 
IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International 
Standards on Auditing ("ISAs"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, 
Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By -Laws”) and the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including 
International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
(a) Annual impairment assessment of the carrying amount of goodwill on consolidation
As at 30 September 2024, goodwill on consolidation of the Group was allocated to three (3) Cash
Generating Units (“CGUs”) identified according to business segments, which comprised plantation,
manufacturing and property development with a total carrying am ount of RM364.9 million as disclosed in
Note 15 to the financial statements. In relation to this, management is required to perform impairment
assessment on an annual basis.
We determined the impairment assessment of goodwill on consolidation for the plantation and 
manufacturing CGUs to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant 
judgements and estimates in determining the recoverable amount of goodwill on consolidation for these 
CGUs. The significant judgements and estimates include future results, and the key assumptions applied 
to the cash flow projections of the CGUs, include projected growthrates, budgeted profit margins and 
appropriate pre -tax discount rates for the respective CGUs. The projected growth rates used for the 
plantation CGU are determined based on management’s estimate of commodity prices, palm yields, oil 
extraction rates and cost of production, whilst the projected growth rates of the manufacturing CGU are 
determined based on the industry trends and past performances.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
(Continued)
Audit response
Our audit procedures included the following:
(i) compared cash flow projections against recent performance and assessed the key assumptions in 
projections to available external industry sources of data, where applicable;
(ii) compared prior period projections to actual outcomes to assess the reliability of management’s 
forecasting process;
(iii) verified projected growth rates and budgeted profit margins by assessing evidence available to 
support these key assumptions used in the cash flow projections;
(iv) verified pre-tax discount rates used by management for the CGUs by comparing to weighted average 
cost of capital of the Group and its relevant risk factors; and
(v) performed sensitivity analysis of our own to stress test the key assumptions in the impairment 
assessment.
(b) Impairment assessment of the carrying amount of investment in an associate
As at 30 September 2024, the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in Synthomer plc (“Synthomer”) 
amounted to RM2,231.8 million, which is net of impairment loss of RM180.0 million as disclosed in Note 
18 to the financial statements. Management has performed an impairment assessment due to the carrying 
amount of the investment exceeded the market value of Synthomer of RM538.5 million, which was based
on its share price as at 30 September 2024 quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
We considered this to be a key audit matter because it requires management to exercise significant 
judgements and estimates on the key assumptions in determining the recoverable amount of Synthomer 
based on value-in-use calculations. The value -in-use calculations reflect certain key assumptions made 
by management including estimated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) growth rates, terminal growth rate and discount rate applied.
Audit response
Our audit procedures included the following:
(i) compared cash flow projections against recent performance and assessed the key assumptions in 
projections to available external industry sources of data, including developing an auditor’s point of 
estimate, where applicable;
(ii) compared prior period projections to actual outcomes to assess the reliability of management’s 
forecasting process;
(iii) verified EBITDA growth rates and terminal growth rate by assessing evidence available to support 
these key assumptions used in the cash flow projections;
(iv) verified pre-tax discount rate used by the management for the associate by comparing to weighted 
average cost of capital of the associate and its relevant risk factor; and
(v) performed sensitivity analysis of our own to stress test the key assumptions in the impairment 
assessment.
(c) Impairment assessment of the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and right -of-
use assets related to the Group’s rubber glove operation
As at 30 September 2024, the total carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use 
assets related to the Group’s rubber glove operation was RM291.0 million as disclosed in Note 11 to the 
financial statements. Management considered the continued losses of the rubber glove operation as an 
indication of impairment.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
(Continued)
We identified this to be a key audit matter due to continued losses of the rubber glove operation and it 
requires management to exercise significant judgements and estimates in determining the recoverable 
amount of the CGU based on value-in-use calculations. The key assumptions include projected growth 
rates and forecasted margins as well as determining an appropriate pre -tax discount rate used for the 
CGU.
Audit response
Our audit procedures included the following:
(i) compared cash flow projections against recent performance and assessed the key assumptions in 
projections to available external industry sources of data, where applicable;
(ii) compared prior period projections to actual outcomes to assess the reliability of management’s 
forecasting process;
(iii) verified projected growth rates and forecasted margins by assessing evidence available to support 
these key assumptions used in the cash flow projections;
(iv) verified pre-tax discount rate used by the management for the CGU by comparing to the weighted 
average cost of capital of the Group and its relevant risk factors; and
(v) performed sensitivity analysis of our own to stress test the key assumptions in the impairment 
assessment.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information 
and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is 
to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with MFRSs , IFRS Accounting Standards, and the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal 
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for 
assessing the ability of the Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and u sing the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
(Continued)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on aud iting in Malaysia and ISAs 
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and ISAs, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
control.
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal control of the Group and of the Company.
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Directors.
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group or of the Company to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely 
responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during 
our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may 
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats 
or safeguards applied.

REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
(Continued)
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should 
not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doi ng so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries 
of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 42 to the financial statements.
Other Matters
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other 
person for the content of this report.

(b) Re-election of Directors
 Dato’ Lee Hau Hian, Mrs. Anne Rodrigues and Ms. Cheryl Khor Hui Peng who retire by rotation in accordance with the Company’s 
Constitution and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election at this Annual General Meeting. 
 In determining the eligibility of the retiring Directors standing for re-election at this Annual General Meeting, the Board had,  
via the Nomination Committee (“NC”), assessed the performance and eligibility of the said retiring Directors, based on  
the following: 
 (i) the results and findings of the Board Self-Evaluation for the financial year (“FY”) ended 2024; 
 (ii) the Directors’ level of contribution to Board and Board Committees’ deliberations;
 (iii)  the level of independence demonstrated by the Independent Directors (i.e. Mrs. Anne Rodrigues and Ms. Cheryl Khor  
Hui Peng), and their ability to act in the best interests of the Company; and
 (iv) the Directors’ fitness and propriety with reference to the Directors’ Fit and Proper Policy of the Company.
 Based on the aforesaid assessment, the Board and NC are satisfied that each of the retiring Directors has met the following 
criteria required of an effective and high-performance Board:
•	 willingness	and	the	ability	to	challenge	and	ask	the	right	questions;
•	 sound	character	and	integrity	in	dealing	with	potential	conflict	of	interest	situations;
•	 commitment	and	time	to	serve	the	Company;
•	 fitness	and	propriety;
•	 competent	and	capable;	and
•	 past	contribution	and	performance.
 Premised on the assessments, the Board approved the NC’s recommendation that the retiring Directors, namely Dato’ Lee  
Hau Hian, Mrs. Anne Rodrigues and Ms. Cheryl Khor Hui Peng, be eligible to stand for re-election.
 The profiles of the retiring Directors are set out in the Profile of Directors section of the Company’s Annual Report 2024.
(c)  Payment of Directors’ Fees and Benefits 
 Section 230(1) of the Companies Act 2016 provides amongst others, that the Directors’ fees and any benefits payable to 
the Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at a general meeting. In this respect, the Board agreed 
that the members’ approval shall be sought at this Fifty-Second Annual General Meeting on the Directors’ remuneration in  
two (2) separate resolutions as below:
 (i) Ordinary Resolution 4 – Payment of Directors’ Fees to the Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) 
   In November 2024, the Remuneration Committee (“RC”) undertook a review of the fees for NEDs and their respective  
Board Committees. This review included benchmarking against selected similar-sized companies within the same industry 
to ensure competitiveness. It also considered the increased responsibilities and expanded time commitments required  
of the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”). Based on this review, the RC recommended, and the Board approved the  
Directors’ and Board Committees’ fees for FY2024, as follows:
•	  No change to the Directors’ fees payable to NEDs.
•	 No change to the fees payable to the RC and NC.
•	 An increase in the fees for the chairman and members of the ARC to reflect their enhanced responsibilities and  
increased time commitments.  
   Members’ approval is hereby sought for the payment of the Directors’ and Board Committees’ fees for FY2024, as set out 
below:

(d)    Re-appointment of Auditors and Audit Fees
 The ARC had, at its meeting held on 25 November 2024, assessed the suitability and independence of the External  
Auditors, Messrs. BDO PLT (“BDO”), and considered:
 (i) quality of the BDO’s performance based on their reporting and deliverables;
 (ii) adequacy of the experience and resources provided by BDO to the KLK Group; and
 (iii) independence of BDO and level of non-audit services rendered by BDO to the KLK Group for FY2024.
  The ARC was satisfied with the performance and suitability of BDO based on the quality of services, time commitment and  
resources of BDO, and their professionalism and dedication in relation to the FY2024 audit. The ARC was also satisfied  
in its review that the provision of non-audit services by BDO to KLK Group for FY2024 did not in any way impair  
BDO’s objectivity and independence as External Auditors of KLK.
 Having regard to the outcome of the annual assessment of BDO, the Board endorsed the ARC’s recommendation for  
members’ approval to re-appoint BDO as the External Auditors of the Company for FY2025 and to authorise the Directors  
to fix their remuneration under Ordinary Resolution 6.

  Ordinary Resolution 8 proposed under Item 7 of the Agenda, if passed, will enable the Group to enter into Recurrent Related 
Party Transactions of a Revenue or Trading Nature in the ordinary course of business which are necessary for the Group’s  
day-to-day operations and on normal commercial terms not more favourable to the related parties than those generally  
available to the public, and are not to the detriment of the minority shareholders of the Company.
 The procurement of the Proposed Shareholders’ Mandate would reduce substantially administrative time, effort and expenses 
associated with the convening of separate general meetings to seek members’ approval as and when potential Recurrent  
Related Party Transactions arise.
(iii)  Ordinary Resolution 9 - Proposed Renewal of Authority for Directors to Allot and Issue KLK Shares in relation to  
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRP”)
 The shareholders had, at the Forty-Fifth Annual General Meeting held on 13 February 2018, approved the authority  
for the Directors to allot and issue KLK Shares in relation to DRP and such authority will expire at the conclusion of this  
Annual General Meeting.
 Ordinary Resolution 9 proposed under Item 8 of the Agenda, if passed, will give authority to the Directors to allot and  
issue KLK Shares pursuant to the DRP in respect of any dividends declared, and such authority shall expire at the conclusion  
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
 The authority given for Ordinary Resolutions 7, 8 and 9 mentioned above unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire  
at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Further information on Ordinary Resolutions 7 and 8  
is set out in the Circular to Shareholders of the Company dated 31 December 2024 which is available on the Company’s  
website, www.klk.com.my.
