It gives me great pleasure to introduce the PayNet Digital Payments Insights Study 2022, 
our inaugural publication focusing on key trends influencing and reshaping the 
payments landscape in this country
The recent 2 ½ years was unparalleled by any measure. 
COVID-19 impacts are still resonating and, in many 
respects, have completely transformed our lives. 
Movement controls, physical distancing and heighted 
personal hygiene concerns jolted rapid adoption of 
digital payments by consumers and digital 
transformation by businesses. Digital payments 
continues to be a critical enabler for economic 
development and growth.
Payments Network Malaysia Sdn Bhd (‘PayNet’) 
commissioned Nielsen IQ to conduct this Study in Q4 
last year to gauge the extent of payment behaviour
changes among consumers and businesses throughout 
the country. 
6 key trends were observed in re-shaping the Malaysian 
retail payments landscape. Preference for mobile over 
desktop banking in making payments, the rise of QR 
payments, continued trust in cards (especially debit 
cards) for in-store payments and dwindling cheques 
usage were noted. An important trend to note from two 
key observations is the significant erosion in cash 
usage, although it remains the primary payment mode. 
Two key observations from our fieldwork in Q4 2021 
are, firstly, use of cash by consumers in making 
payments was not as high as before the pandemic 
and secondly, businesses’ payment behaviours across 
the nation differ. Those in the South and East Coast 
regions had not noticeably changed their preference 
for cash payments. In other regions, particularly the 
North, clear shifts to digital payments since the 
pandemic can clearly be seen. 
Our Study also included 2 special focus areas - the 
extent of digital payments adoption in SMEs’ digital 
transformation agenda and factors driving continued 
use of cash for payments. 
Findings from this Study indicate Malaysia is on the 
right trajectory for mass digital payments adoption 
and we conclude with 4 key enablers for sustained 
adoption. We trust this Study provides useful 
information and valuable insights as we navigate 
through the new age of digitalisation.

Malaysian payments landscape: 6 key trends
Mobile banking preferred 
over desktop banking
Cards are trusted for
in-store e-payment
Cash is still the main 
payment mode
Consumers increasingly prefer 
‘on-the-go’ mobile banking for 
payments compared to desktop 
online banking, mainly due to the 
flexibility in catering to both online 
and in-store purchases.
Card payments are the most 
popular digital payment mode for 
in-store purchases, mainly due to 
the high degree of trust and 
convenience (wide acceptance and 
easy to use).
Despite declining trend, cash 
remains the most preferred 
payment choice. 78% of Malaysians 
still prefer cash, 11% lesser since 
the pandemic (89%). 48.4% still pay 
by cash on a daily basis, more so in 
non-urban areas (nearly 2/3) than 
in urban areas (36.2%).
Rapid rise in 
QR payments 
Lower usage of 
cash payments 
Cheque usage continues 
to dwindle
QR payments grew the fastest 
during the pandemic, with 13% 
higher usage. Factors include 
convenience (increased merchants’ 
acceptance), usage promotions by 
providers and merchants as well as 
its use for disbursing government 
payouts.
Malaysians generally use 2-10% 
lesser cash compared to before the 
pandemic. Age, gender, location 
and income levels influence 
preference. Businesses in Southern 
& East Coast regions remain 
staunch users of cash.
Cheques are the least preferred 
payment option with only 4% of 
Malaysians still using this payment 
mode, down 5% from 9% before 
the pandemic.

From companies' perspective, e-payments services are now the most 
preferred payment mode, followed by e-wallets. A deep dive on the rise of  e-
wallets is on pages 19-22.

Consumers’ use of digital payments depends on their age, 
gender, ethnicity and their location (i.e. urban vs non-urban)
Businesses’ digital payments usage tend to be influenced by 
their customers and supply chain’s preferences, geographical 
location, type and size of business.
Urban and single females who are 18-25 years
tend to prefer digital payments
• Businesses in Northern, Central and East Malaysia 
are moving to digital payments as the preferred mode
Non-urban and married males who are 61-65 years
tend to still prefer cash
• Businesses in East Coast and Southern regions 
tend to still prefer cash

On average 48.4% of Malaysians still use cash for daily expenses, 
even more so in non-urban areas 
The preference for cash is lesser for payment of daily expenses, with 48.4% daily 
expenses in Malaysia still paid in cash.
In this context, the ‘urban-rural divide’ is obvious – only 36.2% living in urban areas and 
nearly 2/3 living in non-urban areas are sticking to cash payments. Convenience 
(accepted everywhere) is the main reason cited for paying with cash and for not 
wanting to switch to cashless. Refusal to adopt cashless is also due to the perceptions 
of technology failure and the notion that it is easier to keep track of personal budget.
Top 3 reasons for pay with cash Top 3 reasons for not wanting to 
switch to digital payments
1  Cash is accepted everywhere (80%) 1 Cash is accepted everywhere (78%)
2 Personal preference (50%) 2 Fear of technology failure (53%)

Malaysia retail payments landscape:
the big picture
When movement controls were first imposed in March 2020, 
economic activities were deeply impacted. 
Many businesses quickly pivoted to digital and remote working 
with home delivery options for survival. These changes have since 
remained as many transitioned to a hybrid setting as the country 
transitions into an endemic phase. 
The accelerated consumer adoption of digital payments has yet to 
fully offset the dominance of cash, but our study suggests cash 
usage has slowed. The observed behavioural changes since the 
pandemic are also expected to be largely permanent.

---- Page 11 ----
Age, gender, ethnicity and geographic locations influence payment behaviours. Early adopters tend to be among 18-25 year old 
single females living in urban areas, whereas 61-65 year old married males living in non-urban areas tend to be among the last to adopt 
or use digital payments. Mainstream users tend to be 18-40 year old males and females living in urban areas.

---- Page 13 ----
Gen Y & Z 
(“I want to”)
Technology barrier – Low
Digital natives. Technology is 
second nature, ingrained in almost 
every aspect of daily lifestyle.  
Motivation – Perks and rewards 
(for Gen Y), gamification and 
instant gratification (for Gen Y & Z).
Influence – Typically relies on 
social media & netizens’ 
comments, tweets, reviews and 
feedbacks in decisions to adopt 
and/or continue usage. More 
inclined to what is trendy.
Generation X 
(“I don’t mind”)
Technology barrier – Moderate 
Digital adopters/adapters. Uses 
technology more for necessity in some 
parts of their daily lifestyles.
Motivation – More substantive 
rewards (e.g. cashback, rebates 
and discounts) are key attractions for 
this Generation. 
Influence – Typically relies on ‘word of 
mouth' positive experience from own 
social and family circles. Adopts and 
uses only when digital payment is 
already mainstream, popular and 
proven convenient, easy to use with no 
security or trust issues.
Boomers
(“I have to”)
Technology barrier – High
Trust issues with technology, adopting 
and using with help or support of tech-
savvy family members or friends.
Motivation – Not motivated by perks or 
rewards. Will adopt digital payments 
when there is no other choice and 
extremely simple to use (e.g. contactless 
cards, not requiring PIN or TAC). 
Influence – Typically relies on decisions 
made by family members who are also 
willing to assist in adoption and usage.

decreased since the pandemic.
Leading the change are 18-25 year old 
single females living in urban areas. 18-
35 year old (Gen Y & Z) are the highest 
adopters of digital payments. 
At the other end of the spectrum, 61-65 
year old married males in non-urban 
areas (a sliver of the Boomer 
Generation) are the slowest to adopt 
digital payments.

Malaysia has a relatively young population 
with a median age of 29.6 years. 69.6% are 
aged 15-64 year old1.
This means that Malaysia has a sizeable 
population, who are more likely to opt for 
digital payments. Online lifestyles and 
needs of the mass digital payment user 
segment (i.e. 18–40 year old) can largely 
be categorised into 3 main groups.

Different digital payment modes are preferred,
depending on context
Debit cards and e-wallets are used more 
for out-of-home consumption (e.g. eating 
out, retail & groceries spend in-store).
E-payment services are used for utilities 
and bills payments, mainly out of necessity 
(i.e. counter closures due to movement 
controls). The habit largely continued even 
after counters re-opened. All types of digital 
payments increased in this space, except for 
credit cards payments.
Credit card usage behaviours remained 
stable, probably due to its relative maturity 
(mainstream usage).

The higher inclination toward digital payments suggest Malaysia is nearing an ‘inflection point’ of consumer mindset transformation. 
Behavioural shifts were noted, with preferred digital payment modes depending on the payment contexts.
Before Pandemic Currently
Cash or cheques for over-the-counter payments 
of utility and bills payments >
E-wallets, JomPAY, DuitNow and FPX, especially 
since the movement controls. For over-the-
counter bill payments, debit cards and QR 
payments are replacing cash
Cash for purchases of F&B, retail or groceries at 
hawkers, food trucks, stalls and other micro sellers >
E-wallets, DuitNow and debit cards, as micro 
sellers turned to food delivery apps, online 
marketplaces and social media as physical 
operations were stopped
QR payments were ‘niche’ (only to those familiar 
with QR technology), despite increased awareness 
& adoption campaigns
>
QR payments reaching mainstream acceptance 
as major e-wallets become inter-operable and 
DuitNow QR available in mobile banking apps

Q29. Why do you use Debit or Credit Card for your transactions?
Debit and credit cards are among the earliest forms of digital payments and remained the digital 
payment of choice for 3 main reasons.
Convenience (accepted at many businesses and easy to use), able to handle large payments and track 
expenses are main reasons for using cards. Rewards and cashbacks (more for credit cards and recently, 
debit cards) reinforced continued usage.

are monthly users. Monthly usage frequency on average rose 
60% since the pandemic from 10.5 times to 16.8 times. Non-
urban users also grew, thanks to government incentives 
disbursements via major e-wallets and continuous incentives for 
usage by e-wallet providers and merchants. 
The average per transaction value increased 15% to RM175, 
compared to RM152 before the pandemic, mainly due to 
expanded features (e.g. bill payments, investments, insurance 
and other in-app financial products purchases and 
subscriptions) and expanded user groups of 31-60 year old (BP: 
below 30s).

Convenient to have more than 1 e-wallet, as most support 
inter-operable acceptance
Too many 
providers
Despite inter-operability, there are too many e-wallets 
with little differentiation among the brands
The highest feedback received was for Malaysia to have a national consolidated 
e-wallet. This indicates consumers’ desire to maintain a single source of fund to 
make any QR payments.

Drivers of e-wallet adoption and usage
“I think it is about 2 or 3 years ago. It is an 
incentive under the previous government.”
- Male, Engineering student, 24, 
B40, living in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur
“Everyone installed the app to get the RM30.”
- Male, Tech follower & Business Analyst, 
26, B40, living in OUG, Kuala Lumpur
“Maybe people start to be aware of all these. 
Some don’t know, but because they want to 
get the money, then only they start to 
download the app, and get used to the app.”
- Female, Insurance agent, 36, 
M40, living in Semenyih, Selangor
“I first used it to redeem the RM30 incentive, 
and from that I started to use it. I then top up 
the wallet and link my bank account there.”
- Female, Admin Operation Assistant & 
Tech Savvy, 28, B40, living in Bukit Jalil 
Kuala Lumpur
“I use A (marketplace platform) because they 
come with free delivery and coins. I used the 
coins to offset my purchase amount. That is 
why I prefer using APay1.”
- Female, Housewife, 58, 
B40, living in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur
“I like to use e-wallet because I like to collect 
the cashback and voucher for my next 
purchase. That's it. It is easy.”
- Female, Admin, 23, 
B40, living in Melawati, Selangor
“Shop X does not have e-wallet A, I prefer this 
more than my bank’s e-wallet because I 
realised that they will give me a rewards 
through the game in their app.” 
- Male, Part-time Hardware Sales-Person, 
24, B40, living in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur
Incentives have spurred 
adoption and usage
Government-driven incentives
Our study revealed novelty and incentives 
tend to drive adoption and usage. After the 
upfront reward/incentive is exhausted, 
some got into the habit, but some also 
returned to cash usage.
Commercially-driven incentives
Payers’ choice of e-wallets are driven by 
rewards based on their lifestyle needs and 
usage. Gamification-based rewards tend to 
appeal to Gen-Y and Gen-Z.

Paradigm shifting among businesses
“Acceptance among the consumers are great and 
encouraging. In major cities, growth has been 
exponential. Now it is spreading everywhere, no 
longer urban focused.”
- Senior banking industry professional
“COVID-19 catapulted into everyone doing 
things they never did. It expedited the adoption 
(of digital payments) from the individual 
(customers) and among retailers. Worries on 
trust issues dissipated.” 
- Senior banking industry professional
“Even my parents who are in their seventies 
started to use e-wallets last year. So surprising, I 
think COVID-19 expedited it. If there is no 
pandemic, no MySejahtera, I don’t think my 
parents will ever think of using e-wallets. 
Because they are so familiar with QR scanning, 
there is very little need to educate on how to 
make QR payments.”
- Senior payment gateway professional
Our study revealed among the challenge to 
digitally transform is partly mindset change (i.e. 
business owners’ own perception that their 
customers doubt safety & security of e-payments) 
and partly operating environment (i.e. workers and 
supply chains requirements for cash).
Cash or post-dated cheques were reported as being more efficient 
in businesses that rely mainly on manual migrant workers (daily 
wages paid in cash as they do not have bank accounts) as well as 
those with cash intensive supply chains. Businesses without these 
impediments are steadily shifting to digital payments, to keep up 
with customer demands

Business expansion, maintaining growth momentum, staying ahead of competition and brand building are among the main reasons 
cited by SMEs (especially among those who are more mature) for digitally transforming, including in adopting and offering a range of 
digital payments options. Advanced SMEs recognise the role of digital payments in facilitating business growth for survival. Apart from 
these, SMEs see the following role of digital payments in driving their business goals:
Role of digital payments in driving SMEs’ business goals Other specific reasons include:
1   Assists in delivering quality service
2   Increases efficiency and saves time – eliminates 
administrative and finance work (reconciliation, easily 
monitor and track inflow and outflow of funds)
3   Safety and security – reduces risk of robbery, thefts, cash 
shortage and losses from counterfeit notes
4   Expands customer base – cater to payment needs of 
omnichannel shoppers, across multiple platforms
Business expansion
Facilitates entry into different districts and subsequently scale 
to nationwide presence by attending to more customers’ 
digital payments preferences.

Motivation for digital transformation among SMEs

---- Page 29 ----
“I believe that most of my customers want 
many kinds of cashless options to pay in 
our café. Not long after e-wallets 
introduction, people started to ask, when 
are we making them available.”
- SME in F&B
“I get people who say that they don’t want 
to see my website and don’t want to go to 
online marketplaces. 
They just want to transfer funds to me via 
internet banking, WhatsApp me the 
confirmation and order so that I just deliver 
them what they bought.”
- SME in e-commerce
“My customers will come to the nearest 
store that does home deliveries. They are 
scared to shop in-store due to the 
pandemic. They are also afraid to handle 
currency notes to make payments due to 
the risk of contracting the virus.”
- SME in Retail
PayNet Digital Payments Insights Study 2022 29
Motivation for multiple digital payment modes
among SMEs
1  Shopping behavior where consumers visit physical stores to touch and feel the products but opt to purchase them online
2 The opposite of showrooming
Businesses confirmed consumer behaviors and demands have been changed by 
‘showrooming’1 and ‘webrooming’2, particularly since the pandemic. Forward-
looking SMEs pivoted into omnichannel presence with multiple digital payment 
options online and in-store to remain competitive. These became the catalyst for 
end-to-end SMEs’ digital transformation.

The future of digital payments in Malaysia:
a promising outlook
Malaysia is on the right digital payments growth trajectory.
The awareness among businesses, including SMEs, of the need to undergo 
digital transformation for survival and to remain competitive is fueling 
adoption of digital payments. Businesses we spoke to generally do not 
face difficulty in accessing desktop online banking or mobile banking for 
payments. However, they did cite several process-related pain points which 
can be overcome. At the consumers’ end of the spectrum, their demands 
for specific forms of digital payments are driving businesses to offer more 
than one payment mode. Neither businesses nor customers cited lack of 
suitable digital payment products as the reason for still using cash or not 
wanting to use digital payments – the top reasons cited are habit (used to 
paying with cash) and convenience (accepted everywhere). 
However, there are clear ‘urban-rural’ and generational divides observed. 
In urban areas where infrastructure limitations are minimal, cash usage 
will reduce if the mindset and habits for digital payments are inculcated by 
increasing familiarity through awareness. Some city areas (e.g. lower 
income areas) still have low merchant acceptance. In non-urban areas, 
apart from basic digital payments infrastructure and expanding acceptance 
points,  digital financial literacy is key to reducing cash usage. Different 
engagement modes should be used to effectively reach different 
generations. For younger generations, social media advocacy is more 
effective but for the older generations (Gen X and older), face-to-face 
interactions yield better results. Adoption of digital payments has 
accelerated significantly since the pandemic and the increased familiarity is 
expected to sustain the growth momentum. 
The adoption curve will shorten with focus on 4 key drivers (next page).

---- Page 40 ----
Acceptance points
Enabling businesses (including SMEs and micro-SMEs) and 
public amenities (mass transport, bill payment kiosks, public 
hospitals and mass parking facilities) where there is high 
payment frequency (regardless of value) would increase 
accessibility to digital payments. 
PayNet Digital Payments Insights Study 2022 40
4 key drivers for sustained
digital payments adoption
Education and awareness
Continuing awareness programs on the benefits of digital 
payments as well as education on safety and security, 
including prevention of fraud and scams are needed for 
consumers and businesses.
Central payments infrastructure and ecosystem
Central payments infrastructure that is accessible, reliable, 
secure and inclusive is essential for the nation’s 
competitiveness and efficiency and to build trust and 
confidence in digital payments.
Having an ecosystem of diverse participants ensures all 
business and customer segments are served, including 
those in the underserved segments.
Public sector and regulator support
Continued support from the following are critical:
• Bank Negara Malaysia, in ensuring a conducive and 
facilitative environment for digital payments to prosper     
as laid out in the Financial Sector Blueprint 2022-2026.
• Government, to set in place essential infrastructure 
needed to embrace digital payments as planned under 
the MyDigital Economic Blueprint.
