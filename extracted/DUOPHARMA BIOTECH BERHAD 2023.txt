ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
COVER  
RATIONALE
As the world fully recovers from the pandemic, 
we do so strengthened by a number of important 
lessons learnt. Key among these is the fact that 
we live in ecosystems that need to be monitored 
and protected to prevent imbalances that could 
cause untold damage. We at Duopharma Biotech 
are keenly aware of the role that we can play in 
this regard, and are committed to fulfilling our 
responsibility to nurture healthier lives. With roots 
firmly anchored on our core values of Passion, 
Excellence, Teamwork, Integrity and Responsibility 
and Respect (“PETIRR”), we strive not only to 
provide affordable and accessible treatments (as 
represented by the products on the branches) but 
also to uplift marginalised communities and protect 
the environment. By managing important issues, we 
seek to make a meaningful difference to everyone.

Dear Shareholders, 
The year 2023 started off on a very positive note 
as Malaysia finally shook off the last remnants of 
COVID-19 and looked forward to political stability 
following the election of the new Unity Government.

Chairman’s Statement
Living up to expectations, the government launched various initiatives aimed at attracting investments 
into the country and promoting entrepreneurship, all of which enriched the ecosystem of various 
industries including pharmaceuticals. Specifically on pharmaceuticals, the New Industrial Master 
Plan (“NIMP”) promotes a more integrated pharmaceutical value chain which will enhance the local 
production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), vaccines and medicines.
As the year unfolded, however, the economy was impacted by global headwinds which led to a 
depreciation of the Ringgit, increases in the Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) and electricity tariff, 
inflation and a generally higher cost of living. Meanwhile, to create greater economic equity, the 
government increased the minimum wage in Malaysia.
STRIDING TOWARDS
SUSTAINABLE RESILIENCE
Ratification	 by	the	Malaysian	 Government	 in	November	2022	of	the	Comprehensive	
and	 Progressive	 Agreement	 for	Trans-Pacific	 Partnership	 (“CPTPP”)	 poses	 another	
challenge for our, and other, industries. This is because the CPTPP stipulates equal 
treatment of goods provided by member states in government procurement. Effectively, 
it	places	greater	onus	on	local	manufacturers	to	be	as	efficient	as	possible	to	remain	
competitive.	While	this	in	itself	is	beneficial	for	the	end	consumer,	the	spillover	effects	of	
promoting local manufacturing would be lost.
The impact of the economic landscape changes on Duopharma Biotech was seen mainly 
in a higher cost of manufacturing and decrease in sales of our Consumer Healthcare 
(“CHC”) products. Nevertheless, enhanced performance of our Ethical products 
cushioned the negative impacts of the operating landscape, leading to a 1.2% increase 
in	revenue	to	RM704.73	million	and	the	maintenance	of	a	healthy	profit	before	tax	of	
RM63.27 million. This has allowed the Board to declare a second interim dividend of 1.8 
sen	per	share	equivalent	to	RM17.32	million	for	the	financial	year	2023.	Together	with	a	
first	interim	dividend	of	0.5	sen	per	share,	or	RM4.81	million,	the	total	dividend	declared	
for	financial	year	2023	amounts	to	2.3	sen	per	share,	equivalent	to	RM22.13	million.
Our very commendable results were due to robust fundamentals that have been built 
over the years supported by strong corporate values – all of which boils down to our 
people. This year, as in the past, the Duopharma Biotech family has demonstrated 
incredible resilience in building our business despite the challenges. Truly embracing 
our Corporate Culture, they are committed to working collaboratively and strategically, 
embracing innovation and a global mindset to achieve our business goals while 
contributing positively to society.

Chairman’s Statement
The convenience of iBreastExam  
was proven when we screened more than 6,600  
women in one month in conjunction with the National 
Cancer Society Malaysia (“NCSM”)’s Pink Unity campaign,  
a feat that has been entered into the  
Malaysian Book of Records , 
marking a national record for the most number of 
cancer screenings conducted in a single campaign. 
iBreastExam was actively used alongside other breast 
screening modalities (CBE, mammograms etc.) to reach 
the 6,600 number of screenings for this campaign.
Continued Value Creation
Despite the challenging environment, Duopharma Biotech has 
continued to live up to our Vision of providing smarter solutions 
for a healthier life. We expanded our portfolio of products, making 
available more treatments – including generics and biosimilars 
– for an increasing range of ailments that are prevalent in the 
country and region. We also introduced a digital solution that 
will enhance the management of dialysis patients as well as 
dialysis centres.  
I am especially pleased by the remarkable achievements we 
have	made	in	Cancer	 Care.	Our	first	cancer	 drug,	LEBRETA,	
has	the	distinction	 of	being	 the	first	oncology	 molecule	 to	be	
produced locally; and is enjoying success in both the public 
and private healthcare sectors. During the year, we started 
to commercialise the production of our second cancer drug, 
Trevive, for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
(CML) and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST). All our 
cancer molecules are produced at our Highly Potent Active 
Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“HAPI”) plant, which truly sets 
Duopharma Biotech apart as the only company in Malaysia 
that has the capability and capacity to manufacture complex 
generics. We are already planning the development of our third 
drug at HAPI to further expand our cancer portfolio.  
Meanwhile, we also introduced a novel handheld device to 
detect breast cancer. 
Our focus on meeting the healthcare needs of Malaysians has 
resulted in Duopharma Biotech maintaining our leadership as 
the No. 1 company in terms of value and volume of sales in the 
Malaysian market. We are also the only Malaysian company 
to be among the top 10 for revenue calculated on a Moving 
Average Total (“MAT”) basis, as monitored by IQVIA.
Deepening our Sustainability Commitment
While the accessibility of quality and affordable medicines 
remains our top-most priority, we are placing greater emphasis 
on our environmental performance because of the urgency of 
climate change issues. The increasing frequency of climate-
related	events	such	as	floods,	droughts	and	forest	fires	is	a	matter	
of deep concern. To play our part, in 2022, Duopharma Biotech 
pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 and net-zero carbon 
emissions by 2050. To ensure we achieve these ambitious targets, 
on 30 November 2023 the Board approved the Group’s Net Zero 
Transition Plan (“NZTP”). In terms of initiatives, we have started 
installing solar panels on the roofs of our plants. We have also 
expanded the scope of our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) monitoring 
to include emissions along our supply chain (i.e., GHG Scope 
3) while strengthening our climate risks management by aligning 
our practices with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. 
To	date,	we	have	identified	the	potential	physical	and	transitional	
risks of climate change. Meanwhile, in January 2023, the Board 
Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) reviewed the rating 
of our risk appetite for environmental and natural hazards to 
enable	better	quantification,	assessment	and	control	of	potential	
environmental and climate-related risks.
There is a need for everyone to embrace sustainable ways of 
living in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Underlining our 
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) stewardship, we 
are not only enhancing ESG awareness and capabilities within 
the Group, but are contributing to industry awareness through 
discussion and knowledge sharing.

AWARDS & RECOGNITION
Resulting from conscientious efforts to enhance our ESG performance, we were very encouraged to see our FTSE4Good rating 
improve substantially, as published by Bursa Malaysia. Duopharma Biotech also continues to gain recognition by various industry 
bodies. Of note, we won The Edge Malaysia ESG Awards 2023, Sustainability & CSR Malaysia Awards 2023, and the United Nations 
Global Compact Network Malaysia & Brunei (“UNGCMYB”)’s The Forward Faster Sustainability Awards. We were also recognised 
as the Best Agency in the Private Sector for our participation in World Cleanup Day organised by the Ministry of Local Government

The Board was also involved in establishing Duopharma 
Biotech’s very first Sukuk Wakalah programme to restructure 
some of our loans as well as to provide working capital. We 
were pleased to see the exercise culminate in our maiden 
issuance on 29 September 2023. In addition, the Board has 
also been working closely with Management on funding for the 
K5 facility for biosimilars which is currently undergoing detailed 
engineering design for further evaluation and assessment by 
the Management. 
A key undertaking that occupied a significant amount of the 
Board’s time was to go over in detail the Group’s Beyond 
2025 Corporate Strategy, an extensive 10-year strategy to 
guide the Group from 2024-2033. After much discussion and 
deliberation, the Board approved the strategy on 30 November 
2023 providing Management the green light to focus on the 
first 5 years of the Corporate Strategy.
Strengthening our Governance Frameworks
Good governance is the cornerstone of the Board’s oversight 
function and is something we have worked on continuously, 
our highly experienced Directors lending their expertise in 
reviewing policies and procedures. This has been critical to 
keeping our governance practices relevant while strengthening 
our frameworks by identifying and plugging any gaps or 
loopholes.
Following the structural changes made in the Board and our 
Board Committees in 2022, we had reviewed and revised the 
Company’s Board Charter as well as the Terms of Reference 
(“TORs”) of all the Board Committees. In 2023, further reviews 
were carried out for the purpose of delegating some approval 
authority as appropriate to the Board Committees with the 
objective of accelerating the decision-making process. We 
also adopted a formal Directors’ Code of Ethics, whereas 
previously the Board adhered to the Code of Conduct that is 
applicable to everyone Group-wide.
We have also strengthened our risk management framework by 
revising our Policy of External Auditors as well as our Personal 
Data Protection Compliance Policy and Manual. The former 
was done to improve the administrative efficiency concerning 
the provision of non-audit services. The latter was reviewed 
to ensure alignment with the issuance of various guidance 
documents and standards by the Department of Personal Data 
Protection of Malaysia. 
As a measure of good governance, Duopharma Biotech 
successfully completed the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery 
Management System Recertification Audit for the Group 
in September 2023. Of note, the assessment, conducted 
at selected sites, resulted in zero non-conformances. 
Demonstrating a deeply ingrained commitment to openness 
and transparency in our business conduct, we created greater 
awareness of our Whistleblowing Policy among our internal 
and external stakeholders.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
Despite various challenges, Duopharma Biotech has 
continued to perform admirably. As always, this has been due 
to the invaluable contributions of all our stakeholders, external 
and internal. Among our external stakeholders, I would like 
to note my appreciation of our shareholders, especially our 
major shareholder, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (“PNB”), 
for your steadfast belief in Duopharma Biotech’s ability to 
deliver; the Ministry of Health (“MOH”), the government and 
regulatory bodies for maintaining a healthy pharmaceutical 
ecosystem in the country; our business partners, suppliers 
and vendors for the consistent quality of your products and 
services; and all our customers for your vote of trust in our 
products and brand.
I am privileged to have such an experienced and high-calibre 
Board of Directors, and would like to thank each Director for 
your dedicated commitment and counsel, which is second to 
none. My deepest appreciation goes to all Board members 
who sat on various committees, especially to the Chairmen 
of the committees that played a crucial role in reviewing our 
policies thereby strengthening the Company’s governance 
structure for the Board’s approval.
On the Board’s membership, a special note of appreciation 
goes to Dato’ Mohamad Kamarudin Bin Hassan, who retired 
on 31 May 2023 as our Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director after a long tenure as an Independent Director of 
the Company. On 1 June 2023, Dato’ Eisah Binti A Rahman, 
previously an Independent Non-Executive Director, took over 
as our Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.  
We also appointed Datin Paduka Kartini Binti Hj Abdul 
Manaf as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 1 
June 2023; and Encik Muhammad Shukri Bin Ismail as a 
Non-Independent Non-Executive Alternate Director to Puan 
Amizar Binti Mizuar on 1 August 2023. However, Puan 
Amizar Binti Mizuar resigned from her position on 20 March 
2024, and in her place, Encik Mohd Haris Bin Mohd Arshad  
has been appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive 
Director as of the same date. Whilst Encik Muhammad Shukri 
has ceased to be the Alternate Director to Puan Amizar 
following her resignation, Encik Muhammad Shukri has been 
appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Alternate 
Director to Encik Mohd Haris on 20 March 2024. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank Puan Amizar for all her 
contributions during her tenure with Duopharma Biotech 
while extending a warm welcome to Encik Mohd Haris. 
It has also been a great pleasure to work with our exemplary 
Senior Management, led by our Group Managing Director 
Encik Leonard Ariff Bin Abdul Shatar. Each individual in this 
team has all the qualities that make for excellent leaders 
– skilled, forward-looking, compassionate and highly 
motivating. A million thanks to them for being able to nurture 
such a cohesive and performance-driven culture across 
the Group. And I speak for the entire leadership when I say 
that we feel very fortunate to have such a committed team 
of employees who have always stepped up to the mark in 
meeting the Group’s goals and objectives. To every single 
employee, thank you. Never forget that you are a highly 
valued member of this family.
Having served as Chairman of Duopharma Biotech and 
witnessed the Group’s growth since 2016, it is time for a 
change of guard as I will be stepping down upon conclusion 
of our upcoming AGM. I am privileged to have played an 
integral role in a company that has evolved tremendously, 
contributing increasingly to healthcare not just in Malaysia 
but the region. At the same time, I would like to take this 
opportunity to apologise for any weaknesses or shortcomings 
along the way. It is hard to say good-bye after eight years, 
but with the continued support of everyone, I have every 
confidence	that	the	Group	will	continue	to	contribute	ground-
breaking innovations towards healthier lives, making a 
meaningful difference to everyone.

Nevertheless, we continued to expand our portfolio organically and through strategic partnerships 
so as to enhance patients’ access to efficacious treatments and diagnostics. At the same time, 
we focused on enhancing efficiencies internally to cushion the surge in operational and financial 
costs brought about by the increase in electricity tariff, revised collective agreement, employees’ 
overtime, depreciation of the ringgit as well as higher interest rates.

In July 2023, we invested

functional plant-based products.
USD1 million  into the
For	more	details	on	our	financial	performance,	please	refer	to	our	Chief 	
Financial	Officer’s	Statement. 	
We were very encouraged by the performance of our Ethical 
business, and especially the Specialty business across all 
franchises – Cancer, Renal and Diabetes. Our Ethical Classic 
business was impacted to an extent by the loss of a principal that 
developed its own channel to market its products in Malaysia. 
However,	the	team	was	able	to	fill	the	gap	left	by	signing	on	as	
the agent in Malaysia and Singapore for a product manufactured 
by another foreign principal. At the same time, both the Ethical 
Classic and Ethical Specialty businesses were able to reap 
the rewards of continuous efforts to build strong portfolios of 
therapies that are relevant and affordable to Malaysians and 
others in the region. 
Of note, we commercialised our second cancer molecule at the 
Highly Potent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“HAPI”) plant; 
and are steadily building our digital healthcare offerings that will 
contribute	 significantly	 to	the	management	 of	diseases	 in	the	
country. We are also seeing our manufacturing capacity and 
capabilities increase steadily, positioning us well to meet the 
anticipated demand for different treatment modalities across a 
variety of therapeutic classes.
While investing into capital expenditure (“CAPEX”) we have 
also been channelling more resources into sustainability as 
we live up to our environmental pledges. Most encouragingly, 
we are seeing a mindset change across the organisation in 
which sustainability is no longer just a compliance requirement, 
but is integral to operational innovation and in driving our 
corporate strategy. As a result of conscientious efforts to build 
a culture of sustainability, our FTSE4Good rating has increased 
substantially.
Financially, our growth initiatives led to a 1.2% increase in 
revenue	to	RM704.73	million,	while	our	profit	after	tax	came	in	
at a commendable RM52.65 million given the cost challenges.
New Partners, Enhanced Portfolio
Last year, I mentioned entering into a partnership with US-based 
The Live Green Co (“TLGC”). In July 2023, we invested USD1 
million into the acquisition of approximately 0.65% equity in The 
Live Green Group, Inc (“TLGG”), the holding company of TLGC, 
to develop a variety of healthy and plant-based functional food 
products, catering to consumers with special dietary needs 
and nutritional requirements. Additionally, TLGC have crafted 
a non dairy-based milk for children, ready to drink powders 
and	 condensed	 milk	 zero	 specifically	 targeting	 the	 dietary	
preferences of vegans and individuals with unique dietary 
requirements. We are thrilled by these innovations and aim to 
introduce TLGC’s offerings in Malaysia by 2024. Meanwhile, 
we will leverage our team’s expertise to revamp where possible 
existing Duopharma Biotech products into clean, functional 
alternatives.

Also building on developments reported last year, on 1 August 
2023 we soft launched IRORO Nutreatment, developed by our 
South Korean partner SCM Lifescience, Inc (“SCM Lifescience”), in 
Malaysia while also introducing it to the Australian market. IRORO 
Nutreatment	 is	a	brand	of	halal-certified	 hair	growth	products	using	
stem cell technology. Currently made in South Korea, we are working 
to increase demand for this haircare range among Malaysians and 
explore opportunities to localise its manufacturing. Sales in Australia 
are managed in partnership with Tepanouits Pty Ltd.
In 2023, we developed three new partnerships – with UE LifeSciences 
Sdn Bhd, RenalWorks Malaysia Sdn Bhd and Luye Pharma Group.
With UE Lifesciences Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of US-based UE 
LifeSciences Inc, we are commercialising a breast screening 
medical device. Early detection of breast cancer is an effective way 
of reducing the mortality rate of patients and saving them a lot of 
suffering from treatment for more advanced stages. Our collaboration 
with RenalWorks Malaysia, meanwhile, further strengthen our digital 
healthcare management offerings. Through RenalWorks Malaysia, 
we seek to offer dialysis centres an integrated software for more 
efficient	 cloud-based	 management	 of	patient	 data	as	well	as	their	
healthcare facilities.
Luye Pharma is an international company that has developed a 
cholesterol management product using natural based ingredients. 
Backed	with	extensive	 clinical	evidences	 and	scientific	 papers,	the	
product offers a safe & effective option for patient to manage their 
health better.
Oncology Developments at HAPI
At HAPI, we began commercial production of Trevive 100 and 
Trevive 400, indicated for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
(CML) and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST). Currently, the 
drug is being supplied to private hospitals and clinics. We have also 
completed	 pilot	 studies	 for	our	third	 HAPI	 product,	 Gefitinib,	 and	
submitted an application for Change of Manufacturing Site (“COS”) 
in	December	 2023.	Gefitinib	 is	indicated	 for	the	treatment	 of	lung	
cancer.

Clinical Trial Updates
Phase III clinical trials for an Alzheimer’s treatment, conducted 
by our partner, Alryxo Biotherapeutics, Inc. (formerly known 
as AZTherapies, Inc.), were completed during the pandemic. 
Despite facing numerous challenges, including a high dropout 
rate, the trial reached its conclusion two years ago. Many trial 
participants were elderly patients, some of whom succumbed 
to	COVID-19.	However,	they	were	unable	to	prove	the	efficacy,	
although safety endpoints were met. In response, AZTherapies 
rebranded to Alryxo Therapeutics and strategically invested 
in Acta Pharmaceuticals (“ACTA”), which is also conducting 
Alzheimer’s trials, albeit through a different pathway.
Meanwhile, SCM Lifescience has approached Duopharma 
Biotech to participate in a Phase III clinical trials for atopic 
dermatitis. This is something we are very interested in given 
that about 20% of the population in Equatorial belt countries 
suffers from some form of the skin disease. We are currently 
ironing out the details and hope to embark on the clinical trial in 
2024. We are also keen to participate in our Korean partner’s 
clinical trials for acute pancreatitis, which should begin a year 
later. 
Regional Investment, Deepening Our Footprint
Given our plans for regional expansion, we recognised the need 
to	increase	 the	capacity	 of	our	Singapore	 office.	Accordingly,	
a	larger	new	office	was	opened	in	the	island	state	in	June.	At	
the same time, we established a subsidiary in Jakarta, where 
we seek to deepen our presence in collaboration with local 
partners. Our immediate objective is to contract manufacture 
some of our dossier products for the Indonesian market. 
Manufacturing
In July, we operationalised the newly completed K3 in Klang, 
which is to take over all general oral solids production currently 
being undertaken in K1, among others. As it has 50% more 
capacity than K1, there is scope to scale up production to 
meet an anticipated increase in demand for treatments such as 
diabetes, hypertension and other non-communicable disease. 
K3	also	features	a	sizeable	office	space	which	is	to	serve	as	the	
administration	 hub	for	all	our	plants	in	Klang.	Office	personnel	
currently	occupying	the	top	floor	of	K2	are	moving	into	this	new	
office	 space,	 making	 40,000	 square	 feet	 in	 K2	 available	 for	
expansion of our injectables operations.
With	the	completion	 of	K3,	the	only	greenfield	 CAPEX	that	is	
still ongoing under our Manufacturing Optimisation Strategy 
(“MOS”) launched in 2017 is K5. We hope to develop K5 as our 
biologicals plant, where we can undertake end-to-end production 
of ERYSAA ®, the erythropoietin for which we currently provide 
fill	and	finish	operations,	 and	other	biosimilars.	 This	would	be	a	
milestone for Duopharma Biotech, equipping us with capabilities 
that clearly differentiate us from other Malaysian pharmaceutical 
players.  
Investing in our People  
We continue to invest in our employees’ well-being as we 
believe it is critical towards sustaining job satisfaction as well 
as overall productivity and performance. During the pandemic, 
we launched various programmes to increase awareness of 
and help manage mental health issues across the Group. In 
2022, we worked with our partner Naluri Hidup Sdn Bhd to carry 
out a Burnout survey among employees while introducing the 
HR Cares Wellness Helpline and Myhealth app. This year, we 
celebrated Mental Health Day on 10 October 2023, organised 
talks and provided training for our People Managers on Stress & 
Mental Health to build internal capabilities on managing mental 
health issues. We also conducted our annual Climate Survey, 
which was carried out by an independent third party. The 
survey indicated a four-percentage point increase in employee 
engagement from 84% in 2022 to 88%.
In 2023, there was an organisational restructuring which was 
accompanied by various leadership changes. Pertinently, we 
were	 able	 to	fill	all	our	vacant	 leadership	 positions	 smoothly,	
indicating good succession planning.

Collective Agreements (“CAs”) with our unions in record time. 
Thanks to good relationships between management and our 
union leaders, negotiations for the Klang CA (which also covers 
employees in Glenmarie) were completed one month before 
it expired on 31 December 2022, followed by settlement of 
negotiations in Bangi a month later. 
Gas (“GHG”) Scope 3 assessment for six categories, namely: 
purchased goods, upstream transportation & distribution, 
employee commuting, business travel, waste generated 
in operations, and product end-of-life. To reduce our direct 
emissions, we have installed solar photovoltaic (“PV”) panels 
on the roof of all our plant in Glenmarie, and will be doing the 
same in Klang and Bangi in 2024. These panels have a total 
generation capacity of 2,558 kilo watt peak (“kWp”), meaning 
that at peak performance they can generate an average of 
3,267,845 kWh of clean energy annually.
I believe Duopharma Biotech is one of only a few listed 
pharmaceutical companies in Malaysia to have made a pledge 
on carbon reduction and net zero, which is something we can 
justifiably	 be	proud	about.	 Making	 good	on	this	promise,	 in	
November 2023 the Board approved our Net Zero Transition 
Plan (“NZTP”), which means we can continue with initiatives 
that	have	been	identified. 	
We are also reviewing our product packaging with the 
objective of minimising the use of materials as this would 
contribute both towards a lower carbon footprint as well as 
reduced post-consumption waste. Initiatives in the pipeline 
include the removal of secondary packaging and plastic 
shrink wrap for selected products. We are also in the midst of 
evaluating environmentally-friendly packaging material.

OUTLOOK
We enter the year 2024 optimistic that market dynamics 
will be kinder to pharmaceutical players. The slowdown 
experienced in our CHC business appears to have bottomed 
out, lending reason to believe that sales will pick up again, 
aided by the introduction of more products such as IRORO 
Nutreatment.
The Ethical businesses, meanwhile, should continue to grow 
along with the momentum established. Revenue from this 
segment, moreover, will be enhanced with a renewal of the 
Government’s Approved Products Purchase List (“APPL”), 
which expired on 31 December 2023. As the current APPL 
was	set	in	2017,	we	expect	the	repricing	to	reflect	and	defray	
inflationary	 costs	 over	the	last	few	years	 and	contribute	 to	
our performance moving forward. This is further supported by 
the 27.2% increase in Healthcare allocation in Budget 2024 
– the highest among all sectors – totalling RM41.2 billion. 
The	significant	 growth	in	healthcare	 funds	demonstrates	 the	
Government’s commitment to continuous improvement in the 
nation’s well-being. 
As for the cost of electricity, employees’ overtime and value 
of the ringgit, we will continue to strengthen our fundamentals 
in order to overcome adversities beyond our control. During 
the year, Management spent a considerable amount of time 
developing a roadmap that takes into account changes in 
our operating environment to guide us towards becoming 
a Top 5 pharmaceutical company in ASEAN by 2033.  
This Beyond 2025 Corporate Strategy, which will be rolled out 
in 2024, together with continuous focus on our environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) pillars, will go a long way 
towards developing organisational resilience ensuring our 
long-term sustainability.
Before ending this statement, I would like to take the 
opportunity to acknowledge the contributions of Ms Ng Su 
Yee,	our	Chief	Technical	Officer;	 and	Puan	Anita	Binti	Esa,	
our Head of Group Risk Management – who retired on 30 
June and 28 February after 26 years and 16 years of service, 
respectively. On behalf of Management, we wish them all the 
best in their well-deserved golden years. We welcomed Encik 
Wan Ahmad Nizam Bin Wan Mohd Salleh on 27 January to 
assume	 Puan	 Anita’s	 role,	 with	 sufficient	 time	 of	 overlap	
to ensure a seamless transition; and also promoted Puan 
Sabrina Binti Haron to the position of Chief Compliance 
Officer.	Puan	Sabrina	has	been	with	Duopharma	Biotech	for	
15 years, and assumes her new role with effect from 1 July.
With the new Management line-up, guidance by the Board, 
and the continued commitment of all employees, Duopharma 
Biotech is set to deliver on the theme of this year’s annual 
report, Healthier Lives, Meaningful Difference.

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
This	year,	the	trend	has	been	further	accentuated.	With	inflation	and	a	generally	higher	
cost of living, consumers have tightened their purse strings and directed discretionary 
healthcare spend towards the essentials. Accordingly, our CHC business decelerated 
even more, with sales contracting by about 25% year on year (“YoY”) while our Ethical 
portfolios have performed even better than in the previous year. The end result has 
been marginally positive, enabling Duopharma Biotech to record a slight growth in 
business from 2022. 
The high-cost environment – especially due to increases in the Overnight Policy Rate 
(“OPR”) and electricity tariff – impacted our bottom line. From a low of 1.75% in July 
2020,	Bank	Negara	Malaysia	increased	the	OPR	five	times,	the	last	hike	in	May	2023	
being from 2.75% to 3.00%. For more than half the year 2023, therefore, we have 
been operating in a high interest rate environment on par with that in November 2019, 
pre-pandemic. As for electricity, effective 1 January 2023 Tenaga Nasional Berhad 
(“TNB”) increased the surcharge on commercial and industrial operations from  
3 sen/kWh to 20 sen/kWh. As of 1 July 2023, this surcharge was decreased marginally 
to 17 sen/kWh. The impact on Duopharma Biotech was a 49% increase in electricity 
costs to circa RM27 million, and interest payments that were 34% higher YoY due to 
the OPR.
Further tightening our margins, we experienced an increase in employee costs as 
a result of the amendment to the Employment Act 1955 which increased the band 
of mandatory overtime payment to include all employees earning up to RM4,000. 
Meanwhile, the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar led to an increase in the 
cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), all of which are imported, primarily 
from China, India and Europe. We also incurred costs from the shutdown of our small 
volume injectables (“SVI”) plant, K2, in Klang for maintenance and upgrading.
As a result of the factors mentioned, most of which were beyond our control, Duopharma 
Biotech	saw	a	contraction	 in	our	profit	for	the	first	time	in	10	years.	Nevertheless,	 our	
fundamentals remain strong and we continued to pay a healthy dividend of 2.3 sen 
per share, equivalent to a payout of approximately RM22.13 million. This comprises 
an interim dividend of 0.5 sen per share, paid out in September 2023, and a second 
interim dividend of 1.8 sen per share, paid out in March 2024. I’m pleased to share that 
Duopharma Biotech has been consistently offering dividends of more than 30% of our 
profit,	which	compares	favourably	against	Bursa	Malaysia’s	average	and	is	especially	
good for a company that has been steadily expanding.

During the pandemic, we experienced a spike in Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) sales and a dampening 
of that for Ethical treatments as patients avoided going to clinics or hospitals, but focused on 
boosting their immunity with vitamins. Since the economy  re-opened in 2022, the trend has reversed 
– with CHC sales dipping  and that for Ethical products increasing.

FINANCIAL STRATEGY
In line with our objective of becoming a RM1 billion revenue 
organisation, Duopharma Biotech has been on an expansionary 
trajectory over the last few years. This has seen the Group 
achieve	 significant	 growth,	 both	 organically	 as	 well	 as	 via	
investments into strategic partners. The latter includes 7.065% 
equity in PanGen Biotech Inc., 1.67% in Alryxo Biotherapeutics, 
Inc. (formerly known as AZTherapies, Inc.), 2.68% in SCM 
Lifescience, Inc., and 3.35% in Naluri Pte Ltd.
This year, despite a challenging macroenvironment, we 
continued to expand via the acquisition of 105,065 shares (or 
0.65% equity) in The Live Green Group, Inc. (“TLGG”) through 
a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with TLGG and 
its subsidiary, The Live Green Co along with other investors. 
Our investment in the US-based company that manufactures 
functional foods cost a total of USD1 million. 
Internally, we have been enhancing our manufacturing capacity 
and capabilities through the development of new plants and 
upgrade of those already existing. In 2023, we completed the 
construction of K3, which has 50% greater capacity than K1 and 
will take over most of the production currently being undertaken 
in	K1.	We	are	also	in	the	final	stages	of	developing	K5,	which	is	
slated	to	become	the	country’s	first	biological	plant. 	
Our	key	financial	 strategy,	therefore,	 is	to	manage	our	capital	
efficiently	to	balance	our	expansion	costs	with	ongoing	operational	
needs and the continued delivery of attractive dividends. In 
previous	years,	we	have	been	financing	our	capital	expenditure	
(“CAPEX”) and other capital-intense projects such as clinical 
trials via conventional term loans, with tenures averaging up to 
seven years. Realistically, however, the gestation periods of most 
of our CAPEX and trials are longer than seven years. Hence, we 
have	started	converting	most	of	our	financing	into	Sukuk	Wakalah	
with tenures from 3 to 10 years.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
For	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 December	 2023,	 the	 Group	
achieved revenue of RM704.73 million, a marginal increase 
compared to RM696.72 million in 2022. This was driven mainly 
by sales growth in the prescription pharmaceutical market, 
ethical specialty sector and the export segment; and offset by 
the 25% contraction in sales of CHC. 
During	the	current	financial	year,	the	Group	encountered	a	surge	
in operational costs, stemming from a variety of factors. These 
included upward adjustments in electricity tariffs, heightened 
finance	costs	due	to	the	rising	Overnight	 Policy	Rate	(“OPR”),	
incremental costs associated with the commencement of 
production in the new K3 facility, adverse trends in exchange 
rates, one-off costs incurred during the temporary shutdown 
of the small volume injectable plant for upgrading and 
maintenance, elevated labour costs following amendments to 
the Employment Act 1955, and a one-off loss resulting from the 
mutual termination of an agreement to sub-lease a vacant parcel 
of land. These increased operational costs, compounded by the 
impacts of decreased demand from the consumer healthcare 
sector,	have	consequently	 led	to	a	lower	 Group	 Profit	 Before	
Tax (“PBT”) compared to the preceding year.
CASH MANAGEMENT
We established an Islamic medium-term notes programme for 
the issuance of Sukuk Wakalah of up to RM2.0 billion and lodged 
the programme with the Securities Commission Malaysia (“SC”) 
on	 24	August	 2023.	 The	 first	 drawdown	 of	 RM364.0	 million	
was made on 29 September 2023 mainly for redemption of the 
loan for K3 and some working capital. In mid to late December, 
we	drew	down	an	additional	 RM29.0	million	to	refinance	 other	
existing	 loans.	This	is	the	first	time	we	have	leveraged	 Sukuk	
Wakalah but believe it is the way forward due to its competitive 
cost	and	flexible	tenure.
The Sukuk Wakalah drawdowns and the cash generated from 
operations have enhanced our cash position by 72% – from 
RM158.0 million at end 2022 to RM271.0 million at end 2023. In 
addition to paying off loans and ongoing operational expenses, 
a	 significant	 amount	 has	 been	 invested	 into	 interest-bearing 	
deposits to offset the increase in OPR. As a result, returns from 
the interest-bearing deposits in 2023, at RM2.8 million, was 
81% higher than in 2022.

Statement

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
CAPEX is essential for Duopharma Biotech as it represents the 
ability to expand our product portfolio in line with our strategy 
of	 diversification	 and	 growth.	 From	 2017-2023,	 we	 allocated	
more than RM300.0 million towards the development and 
upgrade	 of	plants,	 warehouses	 and	offices.	 In	2023,	we	have	
begun to include sustainability projects into the equation, with 
the installation of solar photovoltaic (“PV”) panels with a total 
capacity of 2,558 kWp on the roofs of our manufacturing plants in 
Klang, Bangi and Glenmarie. We invested approximately RM6.4 
million in the solar systems and expect the energy generated to 
lower our electricity costs by about 5% per annum.
GEARING
We have maintained our net gearing at 0.41x, roughly the same 
as 0.42x in 2022. This is a comfortable level for Duopharma 
Biotech,	 giving	 us	 sufficient	 cash	 flow	 and	 liquidity.	 Our	 net	
gearing has remained steady for the last decade, indicating 
very	 prudent	 financial	 management	 as	 we	 keep	 our	 risks	 at	
acceptable levels while leveraging opportunities for growth.
OUTLOOK
Towards the end of 2023, there has been a marked reversal 
in the US’ stance on interest rates which were not increased 
at the last couple of Federal Reserve meetings. This indicates 
that interest rates should normalise, which is positive news for 
the industry. At the same time, a downward revision of the OPR 
may strengthen the ringgit against the dollar, auguring well for 
Duopharma Biotech.
Although there were hopes that TNB would revise its electricity 
tariff for commercial and industrial operations towards the end 
of 2023, in December the national utility board announced that 
the surcharge for these customers would remain the same. In 
other words, we will continue to pay 17 sen/kWh at least up to 
June 2024 when the Imbalance Cost Pass Through (“ICPT”) 
rate will be reviewed.
A	 significant	 new	 regulatory	 requirement	 that	 will	 impact	
our Finance function in 2024 is e-invoicing, which the Inland 
Revenue Board (“IRB”) has made mandatory effective from 1 
August 2024. To meet this requirement and timeline, we are 
collaborating closely with our outsourced IT service provider to 
implement the e-invoicing mechanism across our Group.
We also look forward to the Approved Product Purchase 
List	(“APPL”)	being	finalised,	as	we	are	likely	to	experience	
enhanced sales to Government hospitals and clinics. This, 
together with a marked increase in the government’s Budget 
2024	for	Healthcare,	bodes	well	for	us.	Overall,	the	financial	
outlook for Duopharma Biotech looks encouraging. While 
leveraging the opportunities presented, we will continue to 
focus on strategic capital management, balancing our growth 
investments	with	ongoing	financial	and	operational	needs	as	
well as ensuring healthy shareholder returns.

Our Operating Landscape
Various trends and factors in our operating landscape have an impact on our performance. We identify and monitor such trends, 
adapting our strategies to leverage the opportunities presented while managing all related risks.
INFLATION & HIGHER COST OF LIVING
In 2023, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth slowed down to an estimated 4%-5% compared with 8.7% in 2022 
in	the	aftermath	 of	the	pandemic.	 In	addition	 to	a	decelerating	 economy,	inflation	 has	been	high	following	 several	Overnight	
Policy Rate (“OPR”) hikes in response to increasing interest rates in the US. This has led to a higher cost of living in general, 
resulting in more cautious spending by Malaysians. In the healthcare space, there has been a decrease in the purchase of 
over-the-counter products such as vitamins and analgesics, although patients continue to spend where necessary, for example 
on prescribed medicines.
Our Response  
• While reducing prices of certain Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) products to clear their inventory, we have also continued 
to expand our portfolio by venturing into new product categories such as cosmeceuticals (with the IRORO Nutreatment 
haircare range which use stem cell technology) and functional foods via CHAMPS ® Nutri Bar and Proviton STR Energy 
Bar, which are to be launched in 2024.
• We have continued to expand our Ethical products range, increasing our Ethical Classic portfolio by 56% with the launch 
of Lipascor, Duocoxib and the hand-held non-invasive iBreastExam.
• In the Specialty business, we commercialised our second cancer drug, Trevive, for the treatment of Chronic Myeloid 
Leukemia (CML) and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) manufactured from our HAPI plant in Glenmarie.
• In digital healthcare, we introduced the RenalGenie dialysis electronic health record (“EHR”) software to help dialysis 
centres better manage data related to patients as well as their own healthcare facilities. 
• For more effective sales and marketing, we are optimising the use of digital platforms and databases such as the Hybris 
Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) system which allows for more personalised value-add customer service.
•	 Towards	operational	 excellence,	 we	continue	 to	drive	efficiencies	 through	Continuous	 Improvement	 (“CI”)	projects	 and	
the Lean Six Sigma (“LSS”) programme. The year saw the completion of 31 CI projects leading to almost RM5.5 million 
in savings which are passed on to customers in the form of more affordable prices.

Our Operating Landscape
CLIMATE & SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
As the pandemic has abated, the world has once again turned its focus on climate-related issues which are becoming increasingly 
urgent given climate events related to global warming. The sheer number of heads of state and representatives of governmental, 
non-governmental, corporate and civil society organisations who attended the 28 th United Nations Climate Change conference 
(COP28) in Dubai, at approximately 85,000, demonstrates just how critical the issue is. Among others, it was agreed at the 
conference that not enough has been done to date and that more concerted and collaborative efforts are required to achieve the 
goal of keeping the global temperature within the 1.5°C range. Other than climate change, the issue of plastic waste is becoming 
more pertinent as the volume of plastic being disposed keeps growing, with the UN Environment Programme estimating that the 
equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks of plastic is dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes every day. 
Our Response  
• In March 2022, Duopharma Biotech committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and net zero carbon emissions by 
2050. To achieve these targets, we have outlined a Net Zero Transition Plan (“NZTP”), which was approved in November 
2023. The NZTP focuses on decarbonising our operations, reducing emissions from our value chain and adopting carbon 
offsets.
• In terms of reducing our emissions, we have installed solar photovoltaic panels on the roofs of our plants.
• We have also adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations on assessing 
our climate-related risks and establishing baselines for our Scopes 1,2 & 3 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. 
• In 2024, we aim to perform a preliminary qualitative climate-related scenario analysis to assess the climate impact of key 
transition and physical risks under the respective climate scenarios.
• As of 2024, climate-related risks are included in our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework.
• We also committed to replacing 50% of single-use plastics across our operations with biodegradable plastics.

AGEING POPULATION
Due to a decreasing fertility rate and increasing life expectancy, Malaysia, as with many other nations around the world, is 
experiencing an ageing population. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (“DoSM”), the number of senior citizens 
–	defined	as	those	aged	65	and	above	–	increased	 from	7.2%	in	2022	to	7.4%	in	2023,	comprising	 about	2.5	million	people.	
Projecting into the future, DoSM expects that Malaysia will have almost the same number of young (18.6%) and old (14.5%) in 
the population by 2040, when the elderly bracket comprises more than six million Malaysians.  As the population ages, there will 
be an increased incidence of age-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, depression and dementia.
Our Response  
• Most age-related diseases are those that Duopharma Biotech targets under our Ethical Specialty business, namely 
kidney disease and diabetes. Over the years, we have been increasing our portfolio of generics, biologics and biosimilars 
in these treatment modalities.
• For cancer, we started commercial production of our second oncology molecule, Trevive, which is indicated for the 
treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST); and have completed pilot 
studies	for	our	third	cancer	product,	Gefitinib,	used	to	treat	lung	cancer.
• Notably, we have introduced iBreastExam to the Malaysian market, a hand-held scanner that is able to detect abnormal 
lumps	in	the	breast,	therefore	significantly	aid	in	the	detection	of	breast	cancer	at	early	stages.
• To facilitate the management of dialysis patients, we launched a proprietary software that helps dialysis centres better 
manage patient and administrative data.
• We have invested in a US-based biotech company, Alryxo Biotherapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as AZTherapies, Inc.), a 
company working on development of products for neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer’s disease.

EXPIRY OF BLOCKBUSTER DRUGS 
Between now and 2030, billions of dollars’ worth of blockbuster drugs will go off what is widely termed the “patent cliff”, i.e. 
when their patents expire opening up these drugs to generics or biosimilars. According to estimates by Ernst & Young, the value 
of sales at risk for the top 20 biopharma companies is USD180 billion. Most of these drugs are the more complex biologics, 
presenting the opportunity for smaller pharmaceutical companies, especially those that serve emerging and less developed 
markets, to develop biosimilars of the originator drugs. Being more affordable, these biosimilars would see huge take up in 
countries where most of the population are unable to afford high-cost healthcare.
4
Our Response  
•	 Driven	by	 a	commitment	 to	 making	 efficacious	 drugs	 accessible	 and	 affordable,	 Duopharma	 Biotech	 is	 the	 largest	
manufacturer	of	generic	drugs	in	Malaysia,	and	the	only	local	pharmaceutical	company	with	the	capacity	to	fill	and	finish 	
a biosimilar, ERYSAA ®.
• We fully support the government’s pro-generics stance to reduce the cost of medication, with about 43% of our sales 
channelled towards government healthcare centres at prices that are determined by the Ministry of Health (“MOH”). 
Our generics and biosimilars cost on average about 40% to 70% the price of originator drugs. We also export locally 
manufactured generics to emerging markets, mainly in ASEAN and APAC.
• We are developing our newest plant, codenamed K5, which is expected to complete feasibility analysis and application for 
layout approval by NPRA in 2024, into a biologicals facility to enhance our capacity to manufacture these more complex 
molecules to serve the region’s needs.

HOLISTIC HEALTH & BEAUTY
Along with increasing knowledge, people are becoming more conscious of how important it is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and 
diet in order to enjoy optimum health.  This, together with a desire to contribute to a more sustainable environment, is leading to 
an increasing number of vegetarians and vegans. Where possible, people are opting to forego products that are wholly meat or 
that contain meat components. Meanwhile, both vegetarians and non-vegetarians seek pharmaceutical products that not only 
help to make them feel good but also to look good, hence growing popularity of nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals in addition 
to vitamins and other supplements.  As part of this wave of holistic health, people are also reverting to alternative or traditional 
remedies, many of which are plant-based, for common ailments. 
5
Our Response  
• Duopharma Biotech is making inroads into plant-based well-being in partnership with established phyto-biotech 
companies such as US-based The Live Green Co which is developing functional foods (protein and energy bars) and 
other functional foods. 
• We are collaborating with Luye Pharma Group to market a cholesterol management product that leverages the latest 
technology	 to	manufacture	 a	traditional	 Chinese	remedy	based	on	fermented	red	yeast	rice.	The	product’s	efficacy	has	
been proven via long-term clinical use in Malaysia. 
• In 2023, we entered the cosmeceutical space with the launch of IRORO Nutreatment haircare products which use halal

Material Matters
Material matters are sustainability issues which Duopharma Biotech could play a significant 
role in managing as well as topics or issues that are important to our stakeholders and 
which can influence their perception and relationship with the Group. To identify our 
material matters, we conduct a materiality assessment based on a three-step process of 
identification, prioritisation and validation.
Extensive materiality assessments involving internal and external stakeholders are conducted regularly while reviews are undertaken 
every year to ensure we address key stakeholder needs and concerns,  as well as our risks and opportunities. 
Our last comprehensive materiality assessment was conducted in 2022, hence this year we merely performed a high-level internal 
review to determine the continued relevance of our top 10 material issues.
Identification Prioritisation Validation
We reviewed our existing material 
matters against Bursa Malaysia’s 
11 Common Sustainability 
Matters to ensure compliance 
with the requirements of Bursa 
Malaysia’s Main Market Listing 
Requirements (“MMLR”).
We also reviewed our key 
sustainability matters against any 
new issues/concerns raised by 
our stakeholders, mega trends, 
global risks and the material 
matters reported on by our peers.
In 2022, we had engaged  
80 external stakeholders and  
105 internal stakeholders  
(employees and management) 
via an online survey to rank the 
material matters.
The process helped us to 
understand how strongly our 
stakeholders feel we should 
manage these matters; and how 
important our Management feel 
these matters are in terms of 
adding value to  
Duopharma Biotech.
The responses were tabulated to 
identify key prioritised material 
matters.	Results	and	findings 	
were discussed and deliberated 
with our Group Managing Director 
(“GMD”) and Chief Executive 
Officers	(“CEOs”),	and	the	final 	
results were presented to the 
Board for endorsement.
Following	 our	internal	 review,	it	was	determined	 that	the	top	10	material	 matters	 identified	 in	2022	remained	 relevant	 in	2023.	
Additionally,	 in	2023	we	identified	 “Biodiversity”	 as	a	potential	 material	 issues	that	we	may	need	to	manage	and	address	in	the	
future. We will continue to monitor our impact on biodiversity conservation and the views of our stakeholders/Management to weigh 
the relative importance of this topic against our existing material matters. 
We also took steps in 2023 to identify the risks and opportunities of each existing material issue, as discussed in our Sustainability 
Report 2023 in section “Sustainability Risks, Opportunities and Strategy” in page 28 to 36. This was followed by the development 
of relevant strategies to address the risks and opportunities. Moving forward, we will identify the potential risks, opportunities and 
strategy with regard to biodiversity.

Moving forward, the pharmaceutical industry is set for changes at a fundamental level. The Healthcare White Paper, adopted 
by Parliament in June 2023, aims at reforming the healthcare landscape of Malaysia will have an impact on the pharmaceutical 
sector.	The	Comprehensive	 and	Progressive	 Trans	Pacific	 Partnership	 (“CPTPP”),	 ratified	 by	Malaysia	 in	November	 2022	
will	pose	significant	 competitive	 challenges	 to	local	pharmaceutical	 manufacturers.		 Malaysia	is	also	fast	becoming	an	aging	
nation, which in itself brings unique challenges. Hence in 2023, we embarked on an extensive strategy review, involving internal 
and external resources. Approved by the Board of Directors in November 2023, the new 10-year Corporate Strategy is to be 
implemented from the period 2024 till 2033. It considers the challenges we will face in the future, and outlines various initiatives 
to guide Duopharma Biotech towards our goal of becoming a Top-5 pharmaceutical company in ASEAN by 2033.

We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
In delivering sustainable value to our customers, employees, business partners, communities and 
shareholders, Duopharma Biotech undertakes a comprehensive process to identify risks faced across 
the Group in order to manage them effectively. The process of managing and mitigating both existing 
as well as potential risks is central to the Group’s business operations and decision-making process. 
Key Risks & Opportunities
Risk Context: Non-optimised inventory management would lead to a lack of visibility into customer demand patterns, making 
it challenging to plan and adjust our inventory levels optimally.
OPERATIONAL RISK
Mitigation Measures Opportunities
• Continuous communication and planning with 
stakeholders to optimise inventory management, 
aligning inventory levels with business objectives.
• Manage safety stock levels to account for variability 
in demand and supply chain disruptions thus prevent 
stockouts and ensure reasonable buffers for unexpected 
fluctuations.
• Develop contingency plans based on assessment of 
potential disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions 
or sudden changes in demand, enhancing resilience 
against unexpected events.
• Proper inventory management reduces the amount of 
capital tied up in stock and avoids unnecessary losses. 
This optimised working capital can be redirected to other 
areas of the business, such as expansion or investment 
in technology.
• Improved inventory turnover and reduced holding costs 
contribute	 to	enhanced	 cash	flow.	This	liquidity	 allows	
Duopharma Biotech to seize opportunities, negotiate 
favourable terms, and/or invest in growth initiatives.
• Consistent product availability reduces stockouts or 
delayed deliveries, leading to improved customer 
satisfaction and loyalty.

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
Key Risks & Opportunities
FINANCIAL RISK
Risk Context: The Group is exposed to the potential of cost overruns driven by heightened operational costs stemming 
from	foreign	 currency	 fluctuations,	 inflationary	 pressure,	 increase	 in	energy	 tariffs,	 input	costs,	 material	 consumption	 and	
maintenance expenditure, among others. 
Mitigation Measures Opportunities
• Actively seek alternative suppliers as this encourages 
the Company to regularly assess and optimise the 
supply	 chain,	 identifying	 areas	for	efficiency	 gains	and	
cost savings.
• Streamline processes and waste elimination while 
enhancing	 overall	 operational	 efficiency	 through	
structured Lean Six Sigma initiatives, ensuring 
sustainable cost savings and long-term competitiveness 
in the industry. 
•	 Diversified	supplier	 base	 provides	 the	 Company	 with	
stronger negotiation leverage, enabling the negotiation 
of more favourable terms, such as lower prices, bulk 
discounts and/or improved payment terms.
• Lean Six Sigma places a strong emphasis on data and 
root cause analysis, ensuring that improvements are 
not only impactful but also sustainable, grounded on 
factual evidence.
PROJECT RISK
Risk Context: Various factors may disrupt the seamless implementation of operational and/or business projects, potentially 
escalating	Duopharma	Biotech’s	financial	expenditure.
Mitigation Measures Opportunities
• Identify, assess and mitigate potential key risks  
throughout project lifecycles by establishing a 
comprehensive risk management plan from the project 
planning stage up to execution until the project is completed.
• Craft scenario planning strategically for high-impact risks 
by anticipating different outcomes, ensuring quick and 
effective response for different scenarios, enhancing the 
project team’s readiness for unforeseen challenges thus 
minimising potential disruption and losses. 
• Maintain open and transparent communication within the 
project team and with stakeholders via the Management 
Steering Committee to ensure everyone is aware of 
potential risks and the corresponding mitigating strategies.
• The risk management process provides opportunities for 
continuous improvement. Analysing past project risks 
and responses enables the team to learn and apply 
lessons	to	future	projects,	refining	processes	over	time.
• Effective risk management enhances the team’s ability 
to adapt to changes in project scope, requirements and 
external factors. This adaptability can be a valuable skill 
in dynamic project environments.
• Proactive risk management provides opportunities to 
engage stakeholders in the decision-making process. 
This, in turn, fosters a sense of ownership among 
stakeholders and their commitment to the project’s 
success.

We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
Key Risks & Opportunities
Risk Context: As a pharmaceutical company, Duopharma Biotech is subjected to multiple rules and requirements by regulatory 
bodies in Malaysia and the countries to which our products are exported. This exposes the Group to the risk of non-compliance, 
especially	if	the	regulations	change,	impacting	the	Group’s	business	strategy,	financial	position	and	reputation.
REGULATORY RISK
Mitigation Measures Opportunities
• A dedicated compliance function has been established 
to ensure centralised compliance oversight within the 
Group.
• Group Legal and Secretarial, Regulatory Affairs and 
Group Risk Management & Integrity Departments 
together with other relevant stakeholders proactively 
advise on the applicable laws and regulatory obligations 
to ensure compliance.
• An in-depth regulatory review is conducted prior to 
committing to any new project, collaboration or strategic 
venture.
• Ability to make better business strategy decisions in 
tandem with new rulings. 
• Regular monitoring of the regulatory environment and 
maintaining a good rapport with relevant regulatory 
officers	 provide	 reasonable	 assurance	 that	 our	
operations and activities are in line with key regulatory 
requirements, protecting the Group’s reputation from 
any potential adverse impact.
• Changes in regulations may facilitate market access 
in new regions or countries by harmonising standards 
or simplifying registration procedures. This can create 
opportunities for Duopharma Biotech to expand our 
business footprint and access to new markets.

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
STRATEGIC RISK
Risk Context: In pursuing business growth, the Group is exposed to risks related to the viability of investment decisions 
encompassing potential mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”), which could impact the attainment of our strategic business targets.
Mitigation Measures Opportunities
• Perform exhaustive due diligence analysis to gain 
comprehensive	 insights	 into	 the	 financial,	 operational	
and legal dimensions of the target company. 
• Adopt a proactive approach to identify and address 
potential risks at the earliest stages of the process, 
ensuring a well-informed and risk-mitigated decision-
making process.
• Implement a clear and transparent communication 
strategy to keep stakeholders, including employees, 
customers and investors, well-informed about the M&A 
process. 
• Ability to understand market offerings better, contributing 
to the achievement of strategic targets. 
• Effective strategic risk management allows the company 
to capitalise on emerging trends, market gaps and new

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
Following strong growth in vitamins and dietary 
supplements (“VDS”) as well as analgesics during the 
pandemic due to increased interest in disease prevention, 
and to manage fever-related pain, a correction was seen 
in	2023,	as	pandemic-influenced	behaviour	waned.	Added	
to	this,	inflation	and	an	increased	cost	of	living	meant	that	
most consumers cut their discretionary spending. To clear 
high inventory levels of Vitamin C, we decreased prices 
across the board and focused on sampling activation. As 
Vitamin C accounts for about 55% of CHC’s sales, this 
necessarily affected CHC’s top and bottom lines. Despite 
the lower than expected revenue for CHC In 2023, CHC 
performance still registered good double digit growth 
compared to pre pandemic year of 2019.
Our Consumer Healthcare (“CHC”) 
business is responsible for the marketing 
and distribution of over-the-counter 
(“OTC”) products including vitamins, 
minerals & supplements (“VMS”) and 
cosmeceuticals in the domestic and 
regional markets. Key brands in our 
portfolio include Flavettes, Champs and 
Proviton in the VMS segment; Uphamol 
in analgesics; Eye Glo in eyecare; and 
IRORO Nutreatment in haircare, among 
others. Duopharma Biotech is currently 
the market leader for Vitamin C in 
Malaysia.

Operational Review
KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
A key development during the year was the soft launch of the IRORO Nutreatment range of halal haircare products using stem cell 
technology, developed by SCM Lifescience, Inc. (“SCM Lifescience”), our South Korean partner.  These products are available on 
our e-Commerce  platform, dbhealth2go.com , and other e-commerce platform partners such as Lazada and Shopee. 
CHC has also been working with our new partner, US-based The Live Green Co on the development of plant-based functional  
foods products. 
In addition, the team is focused on driving sales through better relationships with general practitioners (“GPs”) and increasing the 
availability of Uphamol in the general trade. This is to cater to growing demand from GPs for Paracetamol while expanding the 
product availability to consumers. 
KEY CHALLENGES OUR RESPONSE
Increase in cost of raw materials and 
packaging materials impacting CHC’s 
bottom line.
• Increase the price of CHC items, determining the quantum via analysis of the market 
and consumer acceptability due to the challenging economic situation.
Decline of Vitamin C business due to 
change in consumer behaviour post 
pandemic.
• Increasing investment in CHC OTC brands such as Uphamol and Eye Glo that have 
high growth potential in the market.
Increasing cost of doing business due 
to consolidation of retail partners in 
the pharmacy channel.
• Collaborate with key retail partners on promotions and other on ground initiatives 
to increase CHC brands off-take while closely monitoring our returns on investment 
(“ROI”).
CHC will continue to grow, driven by OTC opportunities, especially in the analgesics market. As for the VMS market, 
performance will depend on consumers’ willingness and ability to spend on health supplements amid the challenging 
economic situation. In this environment, CHC will continue to invest in brand building activities to ensure top-of-
mind recall for Duopharma Biotech brands among consumers. Duopharma Consumer Healthcare Sdn Bhd will also be 
driving regional expansion of the Flavettes Nutriskincare range in 2024.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
As patient numbers in clinics and hospitals continue to 
normalise post-pandemic, demand for ECB treatments 
continued to increase. This was further boosted by 
concerted efforts by the sales team to leverage data 
analytics via the Tableau Performance Dashboard 
implemented in 2021. Together with enhanced 
teamwork between the Sales, TeleHealth and Marketing 
teams, focusing on individual accounts and products, 
performance	of	the	business	improved	significantly.
Overall, ECB achieved 4% YoY growth in Private and 
Government sales in 2023, with the Private segment 
growing by 6% and the Government segment by 4%. 
Within the Government segment, the tender business 
grew by 7% with demand from the Ministry of Defence, 
Ministry of Environment and Institut Jantung Negara 
(National Heart Institute) growing by 16%. The TeleHealth 
team also continued to perform well, growing its business 
by 22% YoY. 
Our Ethical Classic Business (“ECB”) is 
involved in the manufacture, distribution 
and sales of drugs that treat a wide 
range of ailments, from cardiovascular, 
dermatological and hormonal conditions 
to respiratory, sensory, nervous and 
musculoskeletal system diseases, among 
others. These products are marketed in 
Malaysia and internationally.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
ECB’s performance has improved steadily since the restructuring exercise in 2021 to focus on key accounts and set up a TeleHealth 
team.	Complementing	 enhanced	operational	 efficiencies,	 the	ECB	business	was	supported	 by	the	launch	of	three	new	products,	
which increased the portfolio by 56%, as well as increased sales of the existing portfolio. The four new products were: Lipascor 
– for the management of hyperlipidemia; Duocoxib – for pain management; pen needles and lancets – for diabetic care by Owen 
Mumford and iBreastExam, developed by US-based UE LifeSciences Inc., for the detection of breast lumps and other abnormalities. 
The	iBreastExam	 is	the	first	of	its	kind	in	Malaysia/the	 region	and	is	set	to	greatly	enhance	early	detection	of	breast	lumps,	to	the	
benefit	of	many	women,	with	the	goal	of	detecting	cancerous	breast	lumps	as	early	as	possible.
Among existing products, stellar performance (growth) was recorded for the following products in the private sector:
KEY CHALLENGES OUR RESPONSE
Volatile agency business, with the exit 
of a key principal in 2023.
• Concerted efforts to sign on new principals resulting in Duopharma Biotech 
becoming the Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore agent for disposable medical devices.
• The team continues to explore the possibility of further expanding its network of 
principals.
Increasing market competition. • Continuous optimisation of digital systems and databases to drive effective sales 
and	marketing.	 This	includes	more	efficient	use	of	the	Hybris	Customer	Relationship 	
Management (“CRM”) system.
• Increasing the knowledge and competencies of the sales team to drive execution 
excellence by using the MDL system.
• Continuous expansion of product portfolio through in-house product development 
and in partnership with strategic players.

Expansion of the healthcare ecosystem in Malaysia, with the opening of new private hospitals in 2024/25, bodes well 
for our ECB as well as ESB businesses. At the same time, the sales and marketing team will continue to build existing 
relationships while developing new ones to establish more ties with clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. The objective is 
to increase the business by double digits in 2024. Although any further weakening of the ringgit against the US dollar 
will increase the cost of treatments, this is something that will affect all industry players too. On our part, Duopharma 
Biotech will continue to focus on cost reduction through effective procurement which will be passed on to patients in 
the form of the most affordable drug prices.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
The growth in demand experienced in 2022 for diabetes, 
renal and cancer treatments continued into 2023. This, 
combined with a debottlenecking of supply chain issues 
and proactive marketing, led to positively increased 
sales. Our Cancer Care Franchise saw the largest 
sales growth, of 26% year on year (“YoY”), followed 
by the Renal Care Franchise, at 15%, and Diabetes 
Care Franchise, at 8%. This was driven by double-digit 
growth of all our key products, namely our ERYSAA ® 
(Erythropoietin alfa), Krabeva (Bevacizumab, for multiple 
indications including colorectal, ovarian and cervical 
cancers), Zuhera (Trastuzumab, for breast cancer) and 
our human insulin Insugen. ESB’s performance was also 
boosted by brand expansion in the export market, with 
a number of key products making their debut in ASEAN.
Our Ethical Specialty Business (“ESB”) 
focuses on treatments – including 
generics and biosimilars – that target 
our three specialty (or franchise) areas, 
namely kidney disease, cancer and 
diabetes. In the near future, we seek to 
expand our portfolio into autoimmune 
diseases.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
A key achievement during the year was to commercialise our second HAPI-produced cancer drug, Trevive (Imatinib) since April 
2023. Both dosages (100mg and 400mg) of the drug that treats leukaemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumours are now available at 
hospitals	and	pharmacies.	We	also	successfully	took	our	first	HAPI	cancer	drug,	Lebreta,	to	Cambodia,	Singapore	and	Pakistan,	while	
introducing Unihepa and Ranofer in Laos, and ERYSAA ® to the Philippines. Meanwhile, Krabeva, which was launched in 2022, saw 
sales more than double in Malaysia in 2023.
In the digital healthcare space, we launched the RenalGenie dialysis electronic health record (“EHR”) software on 25 November 2023. 
The proprietary software was developed by RenalWorks Malaysia Sdn Bhd to help dialysis centres better manage data related to 
patients as well as their own healthcare facilities. 
KEY CHALLENGES OUR RESPONSE
Predatory pricing from innovator 
products, and ongoing price war 
among competitors, especially other 
local manufacturers. 
• Offer competitive pricing to improve access to generic and biosimilar products to 
patients in need.
Noticeable shift in treatment regime 
towards newer- generation products.
• Conduct regular market assessments to keep track of and understand the latest 
market dynamics. 
•	 Educate	stakeholders	on	product	quality,	safety,	efficacy	and	the	unique	competitive 	
advantages of generics and biosimilars to improve patient access.
Maintenance of adequate supply of 
products to meet market needs.
• Active and constant engagement with relevant stakeholders to ensure smooth 
supply. 
Demand for ESB treatments should remain strong in the foreseeable future as the incidence of non-communicative 
diseases (“NCDs”) keeps increasing, especially in emerging economies such as the markets that Duopharma Biotech 
serves. In response, we will continue to expand our portfolio of drugs, both supplied by partners and those manufactured 
at HAPI and our other plants. Among the former, we are looking to launch Caeseva, Ibrelyn and Fortesia, further building 
our Renal, Cancer and Diabetes Care Franchises respectively. 
To enhance our own manufacturing base, we will expand our network of technology transfer partners, not only for 
cancer generics but for cancer, diabetes and kidney disease-related biologics. Once the K5 plant is operational, we 
hope to start producing these more complex generics in the cutting-edge plant in Klang. We are also looking to expand 
our Specialty business to include autoimmune diseases in the future.  
Meanwhile, we will focus on the efficient supply of medications under the Approved Product Purchase List (APPL) and 
to win more contracts for ERYSAA ® , Insugen, Zuhera and Trevive in the public sector, while further developing our 
export markets beyond ASEAN.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
Along with the general recovery of regional economies 
and trade post-pandemic, our International Business 
picked	up	significantly	 in	2023,	achieving	41%	growth	in	
total revenue year on year. This was supported by the 
award of new tenders and the successful launch of new 
products – such as ERYSAA ®, Lebreta, Unihepa and 
Ranofer – in some of our export countries. 
Singapore’s performance was particularly strong, seeing 
a 39% increase in sales, driven by new government 
tenders as well as growth in the private ethical channel. 
Meanwhile, the Philippines and Direct Export recorded 
49% and 31% growth respectively.
Our International Business is derived 
from sales operations in Singapore, the 
Philippines and Indonesia, where we 
have	established	regional	offices.	 To	
accommodate our business expansion 
in Singapore, we relocated to a larger 
office.	Additionally,	in	line	with	our	growth 	
strategy in ASEAN, we established a 
subsidiary in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2023.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
Notable achievements in 2023 included:
• Winning a major tender in Singapore for Dexamethasone Injections valued at SGD700,000, contributing to a 16.4% compound 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of the ethical channel in the country over the last three years, and a 18.7% CAGR in the tender 
channel over the same period. 
• The successful launch of a total of 35 products in the export market—seven in Singapore and 18 in Direct Export countries. 
• Securing new partnerships in Taiwan and South Africa to distribute our products in these countries.  
KEY CHALLENGES OUR RESPONSE
Increase in logistics and raw material 
costs, exacerbated by the strong US 
dollar, increasing the cost of drugs.
• Maintain pricing levels by continuously seeking competitive suppliers and reducing 
our	own	operational	costs	through	greater	efficiencies.
• Collaborate closely with long-standing customers, offering support through initiatives 
such as rebates and contractual purchasing arrangements.
•	 Reassess	our	product	profit	margins	to	maintain	competitiveness	without 	
compromising our overall revenue.
• Capitalise on the strength of the US dollar by accelerating collections to maximise 
gains	from	forex	fluctuations.
Increasingly stringent regulatory 
requirements creating barriers to entry 
into certain markets.
• Monitor the regulatory environment and prepare for changes while collaborating with 
local partners who can provide insights, navigate bureaucratic processes, and assist 
in ensuring compliance.
Geopolitical tensions in export markets 
such as the Middle East.
•	 Collaborate	closely	with	partners	in	conflict-affected	regions	like	Sudan	to	develop 	
mitigation plans for logistics arrangements, ensuring uninterrupted supply to the 
market.
In 2024, International Business Division (“IBD”) will continue to build the momentum achieved in 2023 in Singapore, 
the Philippines and Export Market via new contracts for existing products while growing its pipeline of products. 
In Singapore, its strategic focus revolves around enhanced performance in both the government and private ethical 
channels. While maintaining its proactive approach by pursuing tender submissions, it aims to bolster its private 
ethical channel business by introducing new product lines, including a dynamic range of innovative molecules and 
biologics. At the same time, IBD seeks to further develop its CHC business by launching new products and securing 
listings in retail pharmacies.
In addition, IBD seeks to expand its international presence, especially in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) 
region where the team has identified significant potential. Impending approval by the European Union (“EU”) of our 
Highly Potent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“HAPI”) plant will be significant in this regard, granting IBD access 
to more markets in the EU.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR
After more than two years of a challenging manufacturing 
environment due to the pandemic – marked by supply 
chain disruptions, increased costs and a labour shortage 
– the year 2023 saw the sector normalise to an extent, 
although costs continued to be high. Capitalising on a more 
conducive landscape, our Manufacturing team forged 
ahead with various CAPEX projects while intensifying 
cost savings and building stronger sustainability 
capabilities. We also expanded our oncology (cancer) 
portfolio with the commercial production of Trevive, and 
are working with our biotech partner, Natco Pharma, on 
the	 technology	 transfer	 to	manufacture	 Gefitinib	 which	
treats lung cancer.
Overall, it was a positive year for Manufacturing, which 
recorded 10% growth in total capacity compared to the 
year 2022.
Duopharma Biotech operates three 
manufacturing sites in Malaysia – Klang, 
Bangi and Glenmarie. Our state-of-the-
art Highly Potent Active Pharmaceutical 
Ingredients (“HAPI”) facility in Glenmarie 
is a key differentiator for the Group, 
providing us the capability to manufacture 
cancer generics.

SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION
Since making our environmental pledges in March 2022 – to 
become carbon neutral by 2030; achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050; and replace 50% of single-use with biodegradable 
plastics by 2026 – we have been intensifying efforts to turn our 
operations green. Initiatives in 2023 include the following:
• Installed Solar PV systems at all three manufacturing plants, 
achieving a capacity of 2,500 KWp, generating an average of 
3,267,845 kWh of clean energy annually, at peak performance.
• Commenced the transition from single-use plastics to 
biodegradable plastics for non-product contact purposes, 
5.1 tonne was used in Duopharma Biotech in 2023, which 
equivalent to 7.8% of single-use plastic has been converted 
to biodegradable plastic.
• Implemented water recycling initiatives:
i. Recycle water from the sterilisation process and grey 
water from reverse osmosis (RO) for other uses. In Bangi 
the recycled RO is used for the wet scrubber in our waste 
thermal reduction system Asher and for external cleaning.
ii.	Collect	and	reuse	rainwater	for	toilet	flushing	and	gardening	
in Klang and Bangi.
•	 Reduced	the	volume	 of	scheduled	 waste	sent	to	landfills	 in	
Bangi through the adoption of Asher. In 2023, we treated 
22,880.50 kg of scheduled waste and produced 1,390.50 kg 
of ash, (i.e. 93.9% reduction of waste by weight), contributing 
to reduced GHG Scope 3 emissions.
• Together with Sales and Marketing, the team in Bangi is 
planning a pilot study on sustainable CHC packaging focused 
on reducing the colour print of packaging boxes, and adopting 
ESG-friendly ink and paper.
New CAPEX projects initiated during the year include:
• Commissioning of 30kg Granulation Line with New 
Cleanroom Expansion in HAPI, targeted for Board 
endorsement in 2024, subject to business viability.
• Relocation and consolidation of packaging lines in 
Klang, targeted for Group Management Committee’s

SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE REVIEW
With additional focus and investment into sustainability parameters, 
Duopharma	Biotech	continues	to	make	steady	headway	in	our	five	
focus areas, as disclosed in the following pages.
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We seek to develop a sustainability culture so that the delivery 
of environmental and social value is not just driven by our Group 
Sustainability Department, but is internalised by everyone 
in Duopharma Biotech and externally by our stakeholders. 
Our objective is to go beyond ESG compliance to achieve an 
ESG mindset. Recognising the importance of engaging our 
stakeholders, we are placing added emphasis on this platform. 
In	 2023	 we	 have	 identified	 nine	 distinct	 stakeholder	 groups	
who	are	able	to	influence	the	Group’s	operations	 and	business	
performance or who are impacted by the same. 
Details of our stakeholder groups, engagement platforms, how we impact 
each other, the stakeholders’ areas of concern and how we respond to the 
stakeholders can be found in ‘Our Strategic Review’ section (Stakeholder 
Engagement), and in our Sustainability Report 2023 (page 18 to 23).
MATERIAL MATTERS
Material matters present risks and opportunities for Duopharma 
Biotech,	which	require	us	to	play	a	significant	role	in	managing	
the potential impacts. It also highlighted topics or concerns 
that hold importance to our stakeholders and can impact their 
perception and relationship with the Group. We conducted 
a comprehensive materiality assessment in 2022, involving 
internal and external stakeholders via engagement feedback 
survey.	A	total	of	17	sustainability	 matters	were	identified,	 with	
ten being the most material. Regular reviews of these matters

Our approach to climate risk management is guided by TCFD 
recommendations, where we have started to adopt several of 
its recommendations related to Governance, Strategy, Risk 
Management and Metrics and Targets, with the goal of achieving 
full disclosure by 2025. At the Group level, discussions on 
climate-related risks were also initiated and potential physical 
and transition climate risks that may impact our operations and 
businesses	were	identified	and	monitored. 	
Details of our TCFD-related progress and actions that were implemented 
in FY2023, as well as our climate-related risks and opportunities are 
discussed further in our Sustainability Report 2023 in the ‘Climate 
Performance’ section (page 46 to 52).
Details of our materiality assessment process and review, and 
sustainability matters are discussed in the ‘Our Strategic Review’ section 
(Our Material Matters), and elaborated further in our Sustainability Report 
2023 (page 26 to 36).
were undertaken annually to ensure the continued relevance of 
our material matters.

CLIMATE PERFORMANCE
OUR APPROACH 
Guided by our Sustainability Policy, we have assessed our impacts on the environment and developed strategies to contribute 
positively to a sustainable environment focusing primarily on climate risks (including carbon management) as well as responsible 
water, waste and material management. 
Following the announcement of our commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 
2050, in 2023 we established a Net-Zero Transition Plan (“NZTP”) which outlines a strategic plan and initiatives to decarbonise our 
operations and that of our value chain, while investing into carbon offsets.

Sustainability Statement
In addition to reducing our carbon emissions, we are guided by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) 
recommendations on managing and mitigating our climate risks. We have begun the process of identifying our climate risks, which 
are monitored closely via our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system.  In 2024, we will be conducting a preliminary climate-
related scenario analysis to assess the impact of key transition and physical risks under the respective climate scenarios. 
At the same time, we continue to ensure responsible water consumption via initiatives such as water recycling and manage our 
effluents	 while	adopting	 circularity	 to	reduce	our	waste-related	 impacts.	Through	our	waste-thermal	 reduction	 system	Asher,	for	
example,	we	are	reducing	the	amount	of	waste	sent	to	landfills. 	
Details of our approach, initiatives and 3-years performance data are available in our standalone Sustainability Report  
(Our Sustainability Performance – Climate Performance; pages 44 to 65).

Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement 
UNWAVERING DEDICATION 
TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Emphasising its unwavering dedication to robust corporate governance practices, Duopharma Biotech continuously strives to 
provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of how these practices are deeply integrated into the Company’s 
organisational decision-making processes. Recognising the pivotal role governance plays in shaping long-term success, the Board 
takes	an	active	role	in	overseeing	and	refining	the	governance	framework	to	ensure	its	adaptability	and	efficacy	in	meeting	evolving	
challenges. The disclosure of Duopharma Biotech’s corporate governance practices aims to illuminate its role in fostering value 
creation, preservation, and sustainability over the short, medium, and long term.
The Board of Duopharma Biotech is resolute in its commitment to transparency and accountability by ensuring stakeholders receive 
comprehensive insights into the integration of enhanced corporate governance practices throughout the Group’s decision-making 
processes. This CGOS is further reinforced by a meticulously prepared Corporate Governance Report, which outlines the application 
of Duopharma Biotech’s corporate governance practices in alignment with the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance for the 
fiscal	year	ended	31	December	2023. 	
The Corporate Governance Report is readily accessible on Duopharma Biotech’s corporate website – under ‘Annual Reports/Integrated 
Annual Report’ (https://duopharmabiotech.com/investor-relations/shareholders-meeting-and-reports/) and is also announced on the 
official	platform	of	Bursa	Malaysia	Securities	Berhad	(“Bursa	Securities”).	Both	the	CGOS	and	the	Corporate	Governance	Report	adhere	
to Paragraph 15.25 of the Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) by Bursa Securities and are crafted with guidance from Practice 
Note 9 of the MMLR and the Corporate Governance Guide (4 th Edition) issued by Bursa Securities. This CGOS and the Corporate 
Governance	Report	in	respect	of	the	financial	year	ended	31	December	2023	were	approved	by	the	Board	on	19	March	2024.
For a comprehensive understanding of the Group’s corporate governance framework and practices, it is recommended to review this 
CGOS alongside other statements included in this Integrated Annual Report. These encompass the Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control, Audit Committee Report, Nomination and Remuneration Committee Report, Risk Management Committee 
Report, Halal and Sustainability Committee Report, as well as the Medical and Research Committee Report, including Duopharma 
Biotech’s standalone Sustainability Report. This collaborative approach allows for a more holistic and detailed comprehension of the 
Group’s	corporate	governance	 landscape,	 benefiting	from	the	contextual	 explanations	 provided	within	each	respective	 statement	
and report.
The Corporate Governance Overview Statement (“CGOS”) serves to 
delineate the corporate governance framework adopted by Duopharma 
Biotech Berhad (referred to as “Duopharma Biotech” or the “Company”) 
and its subsidiary entities (collectively referred to as the “Group”).
This CGOS encompasses a comprehensive summary of the Group’s adherence 
to the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”), highlighting key 
areas of focus and outlining future priorities. Recognising the growing demand for 
transparency within the market, the Board of Directors (referred to as the “Board”) 
is committed to furnishing stakeholders with forthcoming and detailed disclosures 
regarding the Group’s corporate governance practices. This commitment includes 
the	 incorporation	 of	 Integrated	 Reporting	 mechanisms	 throughout	 the	 financial	
year being reviewed, aimed at providing stakeholders with a clear understanding 
of the Group’s governance initiatives and performance.

Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement
OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE APPROACH
In its stride forward, Duopharma Biotech continued its journey in 2023 by embracing integrated reporting for the second consecutive 
year, following the guidelines outlined in the International Integrated Reporting (IR) Framework by the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC). The Board recognises that integrated reporting lies at the heart of its value creation process. This process 
heavily relies on the structure of the company’s governance framework and the strategies employed for its implementation.
Duopharma Biotech’s approach to corporate governance delves into the six (6) categories of capitals as outlined by the IIRC. 
It	explores	 how	governance	 practices	 have	influenced	 and	benefited	 the	Company,	facilitating	 the	transformation	 of	inputs	 and	
business activities into outputs and outcomes, ultimately driving value for stakeholders. The Company’s governance practices, 
aligned with the six (6) capitals, are closely intertwined with its six (6) core values. Duopharma Biotech’s governance strategies 
deployed across these capitals and their interconnectedness with the Company’s core values are as follows:
SIX CORE VALUES
ExcellenceE TeamworkT IntegrityI ResponsibleR RespectRPassionP
FINANCIAL CAPITAL
• Duopharma Biotech made a strategic investment of up to USD 1 million in The Live Green Group, Inc (“TLGG”) a 
biotech company based in the United States. This investment has empowered Duopharma Biotech to secure valuable 
manufacturing, marketing, and distribution rights for products co-developed with The Live Green Co (“TLGC”), a 
subsidiary of TLGG within the ASEAN region. By investing in TLGG, Duopharma Biotech has gained access to innovative 
products	and	technologies,	allowing	for	the	expansion	of	its	product	portfolio	and	market	reach.	This	investment	reflects	
the Board’s diligent assessment of opportunities and risks, ensuring alignment with Duopharma Biotech’s long-term 
strategic objectives and commitment to shareholder value.
• As part of its overarching strategic vision, Duopharma Biotech has developed its Beyond 2025 Corporate Strategy (2024 
–	2033)	which	is	designed	to	optimise	the	allocation	of	financial	capital	towards	sustainable	 growth	and	value	creation	
over the long term. This comprehensive strategy encompasses a range of initiatives such as strategic development 
and	investments,	 operational	 efficiency	enhancements,	 expansions	into	new	markets	or	product	lines,	etc.	By	aligning	
its	financial	capital	allocation	 with	long-term	 objectives,	 Duopharma	 Biotech	aims	to	foster	resilience,	 innovation,	 and	
competitiveness in the rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape.
• Duopharma Biotech has in place a whistleblowing programme for employees and stakeholders to report any 
wrongdoings.	 During	the	financial	year,	whistleblowing	 reports	were	low	in	numbers.	Through	whistleblowing	 channels,	
this	has	reduced	erosion	of	the	Group’s	financial	capital	by	way	of	minimising	or	completely	averting	fraud	cases	and/
or enforcement cases brought against the Group.
• Overseen by the Risk Management Committee, stringent due diligence assessments of all potential investments 
and acquisitions are carried out by the Group to identify any probable risks that may affect Duopharma Biotech. By 
undertaking such processes, the Group is able to reduce instances of making poor investment decisions.

HUMAN CAPITAL
• In its continuous efforts to strengthen its ethical culture and enhance good governance practices, Duopharma Biotech

represents a proactive approach by the company to cultivate a culture of integrity and transparency not only within its 
own operations but also throughout its extended network of partners and collaborators. This programme not only serves 
as a safeguard against corruption and unethical practices but also demonstrates Duopharma Biotech’s recognition of 
the critical role that human capital plays in upholding its core values and driving sustainable growth.
• The establishment of the Company’s Diversity, Anti-Discrimination, and Anti-Harassment Policy underscores its 
commitment to fostering a workplace culture that values and respects every individual. This policy, rooted in the principles 
of human capital cultivates an inclusive environment where diversity is celebrated, discrimination is prohibited, and 
harassment is not tolerated.  By prioritising the well-being and dignity of its employees, Duopharma Biotech recognises 
that a diverse and inclusive workforce contributes to enhanced creativity, innovation, and performance.

Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE A: Board Leadership and EffectivenessA
In order to avert instances of excessive self-review threats, 
the Board Chairman does not occupy membership in any of 
the	Board	Committees.	 Application	 of	this	practice	is	reflective	
of the Group’s unwavering commitment to ensuring effective 
check and balance safeguards are in place and that Board-level 
deliberations, including those of the Board Committees are 
premised on the central tenets of independence and objectivity.
In	 fulfilling	 its	 duties	 and	 responsibilities	 as	 stewards	 of	 the	
Company, the Board maintains a direct line of communication 
with the GMD and has unrestricted access to information 
pertaining to the Group’s business affairs. The GMD, Leonard 
Ariff Bin Abdul Shatar, is tasked with managing the day-to-
day operations of the Company’s business and is responsible 
for implementing the policies, strategies and decisions as 
guided by the Board. The Board Charter calls for the role of 
the Chairman of the Board and the Company’s GMD to be 
distinct with the former playing a pivotal role in developing and 
maintaining conditions for the Board to function at its optimal 
level of effectiveness.
The Senior Management, assists the Board and the GMD in 
ensuring its strategies, plans and policies, budgets, decisions 
and procedures, and matters approved by the Board are 
implemented	and	monitored	efficiently.
The	Board	and	Board	Committees	are	supported	by	a	qualified	
and experienced Company Secretary, namely Ibrahim Hussin 
Salleh who provides the Board with periodic updates on the 
latest regulatory developments. Ibrahim is a non-practising 
Advocate and Solicitor of the High Court of Malaya, a company 
secretary licensed by the Companies Commission of Malaysia 
and	an	affiliate	member	of	the	Malaysian	Institute	of	Chartered	
Secretaries & Administrators (“MAICSA”). Ibrahim also advises 
and supports the Board in upholding high standards of corporate 
governance	and	facilitates	the	two-way	information	flow	between	
Senior Management and the Board.
The Board Charter serves as a comprehensive guide delineating 
the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the Board, Board 
Committees, individual Directors, and the Company Secretary 
within Duopharma Biotech. This document stands as a 
cornerstone of governance, providing clarity and direction to 
stakeholders. It is not only a foundational document but also 
serves as an essential piece of literature for the induction of new 
members into the Company.
Accessible via Duopharma Biotech’s corporate website, 
the Board Charter ensures transparency and accountability 
to stakeholders. Regular review and revision of the Board 
Charter and the Terms of References of Board Committees are 
undertaken to incorporate changes to regulatory frameworks 
such as the Companies Act 2016, MCCG and other relevant 
authoritative promulgations. This practice ensures alignment 
with mandatory requirements and the adoption of best 
practices, thus fostering a culture of compliance and continuous 
improvement within the organisation.
Board Meetings
During	 the	 financial	 year	 under	 review,	 all	 Directors	 have	
dedicated adequate time and effort to attend Board and Board 
Committee meetings held to deliberate on matters under their 
purview. All the Directors recorded 100% attendance across the 
ten	(10)	Board	meetings	held	during	the	financial	year	ended	31	
December 2023. During each Board meeting, the Chairmen of the 
respective Board Committees presented condensed summaries 
of the reports, discussions, and recommendations arising from 
their respective committee meetings. These summaries are then 
further deliberated upon by the Board, and any matters requiring 
decisions are recommended for Board action. Additionally, as 
an extension of this process, the relevant Board Committees, 
along	with	their	chairmen,	 submit	 the	confirmed	 and	accurate	
meeting minutes to the Board for notation. These minutes serve 
as	an	official	 record	 of	proceedings	 and	ensure	 transparency	
and accountability within the Company.

administrative matters necessitating the Board’s urgent approval may be sought via circular resolutions supported with all the 
relevant information and explanations required for informed decision-making (with the same applying to the Board Committees). 
In addition to the scheduled meetings, the Non-Executive Directors have a framework and forum in place to meet separately to 
discuss	 specific	 matters	 without	 any	executives	 present.	 During	 the	year	 under	 review,	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 conducted	 a	
separate meeting without the Executive Director or members of Senior Management to deliberate on issues of concern. A separate 
meeting of the Independent Non-Executive Directors was also held during the year without the presence of the Non-Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, the Executive Director nor the Senior Management.

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE A:  Board Leadership and EffectivenessA
The primary responsibility of an Independent Non-Executive 
Director is to act as a safeguard to the interests of minority 
shareholders and other stakeholders. As such, the Independent 
Directors play a fundamental role in ensuring transparency 
and
	 preserving
	 accountability
.
	This
	 is
	 further
	 fortified
	 by
	 the	
placement 
of Independent Directors as Chairmen of four (4) 
out
	of
	the
	five
	(5)
	Board
	Committees
	which
	serves
	to
	infuse	
greater impartiality in the Board’
s decision-making process. The 
presence of Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors on the 
other hand also play a crucial role in their responsibilities for 
strategy and business performance.
As the Board is the epitome of a good governance culture, it 
continuously strives to set the “tone at the top” and cascade 
ethical values and standards across every level of the Group. 
In this regard, the Board has adopted a Code of Conduct 
(the “Code”), which serves as an authoritative document that 
governs the conduct of employees of the Group. The Board has 
also
	formalised
	a
	Director
’s
	Code
	of
	Ethics
	during
	the
	financial	
year
, delineating clear guidelines and ethical expectations 
for the Board of Directors of the Duopharma Biotech. This 
initiative underscores the Company's unwavering commitment 
to upholding integrity and accountability at the highest levels 
of governance. As an additional measure to promote ethical 
conduct, the Board has in place a Whistle-Blowing Policy to 
enable stakeholders to escalate legitimate ethical concerns 
without fear and risk of reprisal. 
Moreover, Duopharma Biotech has taken proactive measures 
to enhance its commitment to combat corruption effectively. 
This includes the implementation of revisions to its Anti-
Bribery
	Management
	System
	policies
	during
	the
	financial
	year
,	
aimed at addressing 
emerging corruption challenges. These 
adjustments emphasise the Company's dedication to staying 
ahead of evolving risks and ensuring robust safeguards are in 
place.
	 By
	 continuously
	 refining
	 its
	Anti-Bribery
	 Management	
System policies, Duopharma Biotech demonstrates a proactive
 
approach to mitigating corruption risks and upholding the 
highest ethical standards across all aspects of its operations.
The Code of Conduct, Directors’ Code of Ethics, Whistle-Blowing 
Policy, and Anti-Bribery Management System policies are 
publicly available on Duopharma Biotech’s corporate website.
Board Composition
The Board c omprises mark et and industry leaders, cutting 
across	 multiple	 fields,	who	accordingly	serve	as	Independent	
Non-Executive Directors, Non-Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and an Executive Director. For m ore details on 
the Directors’ background and ex perience, refer to pages 82 to 
95 of the Integr ated Annual Report.
Independent Directors are responsible for protecting the 
interests of m inority shareholders and other stakeholder s by 
infusing the element of detached im partiality. Duopharma 
Biotech believes that independent judgement serves to promote 
greater accountability and balance in the Board, thus enhancing 
the decision- making proces s. In 2023, the Board comprised of 
eleven (11) Directors, of whom 66% (6 out of 11) are Independent 
Directors.
The appointment of Directors to the B oard is conducted through 
a formal and transparent process ov erseen by the NRC. 
Likewise, the re-election of existing Directors is subjected to due 
process, in line with the Company’s Constitution, whic h calls for 
one-third (1/3) of the Direc tors to retire and offer themselves 
for re-election, where eligible. For the year under  review, the 
following Dir ectors had offered themselv es for re-elec tion at the 
22nd Annual General Meeting:
• T
an Sri Datin Paduka Siti Sa’diah Binti Sh Bakir;
• Leonard 
Ariff Bin Abdul Shatar; and
• Zaiton Binti Jamaludin.
Dato’	 Mohamad
	 Kamarudin
	 Bin
	 Hassan
	 fulfilled
	 the
	 role
	 of	
Independent Non-Executive Director at Duopharma Biotech for
 
a cumulative period of nine (9) years. He retired in adherence 
to the Company’s Board Charter, which imposes a tenure limit 
of nine (9) years for both Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors. Upon stepping 
down from the position of Senior Independent Director, he was 
succeeded by Dato’ Eisah Binti A. Rahman as the new Senior 
Independent
	Director
,
	who
	was
	appointed
	during
	the
	financial	
year under review
.
The Senior Independent Director acts as a sounding board for 
the Chairman and as an intermediary for Independent Directors. 
Additionally, she is tasked with the instrumental role of serving 
as a contact point for shareholders and stakeholders to raise 
any matters pertaining to Duopharma Biotech.

Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE A: Board Leadership and EffectivenessA
The balance between the six (6) Independent Non-Executive Directors, four (4) Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors and 
one (1) Executive Director has positively contributed to diversity of views. This is further driven by the NRC’s due consideration of 
the candidates’ expertise and work experience when considering potential directorship appointments, with the aim of having new 
Board members complement and enhance the Board as a whole. This is further buttressed by the fact that all the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors have served the Board as of 31 December 2023 for a tenure of not more than 9 years, in line with Step 
Up Practice 5.4 of the MCCG.
Within the domain of gender diversity, the Board has 45% female representation during the year under review. Against this backdrop, 
Duopharma Biotech have met the 30% target as stipulated in the MCCG as a higher order corporate governance aspiration. The 
NRC seeks to maintain this advantageous level of gender diversity on the Board and Senior Management due to the Board’s 
appreciation of multifarious viewpoints in Duopharma Biotech’s decision-making processes.
In observing the requirements of Paragraph 15.08 and Practice Note 5 of MMLR, the Board members have undergone the following 
trainings based on the training needs analysis undertaken. The trainings completed shares a common theme with the focus areas 
of the year under review, namely governance, sustainability, digital transformation, and medical as well as healthcare matters.

Board Evaluation
During	the	financial	year	under	review,	an	in-house	Board	Effectiveness	Evaluation	Assessment	(“BEE”)	exercise	was	conducted,	
facilitated by the NRC and the Company Secretary through the use of an electronic-Board Effectiveness Evaluation tool. The exercise 
was undertaken on the Board, Board Committees, individual Directors, and the GMD, via comprehensive questionnaires or assessment 
forms which included both qualitative and quantitative assessments using a self and peer rating model.

Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE A: Board Leadership and EffectivenessA
The NRC undertook the responsibility of providing 
oversight on the conduct of the BEE as well as 
reviewing the outcomes alongside the Chairman. 
Overall, the BEE results were satisfactory, and it 
exceeded the ratings of the preceding BEE results 
in 2022. In the same vein the BEE exercise had 
brought to the fore areas of strengths for the Board, 
Board Committees, individual Directors and GMD, 
as well as headroom for improvements.
The following (4) areas of strengths were highlighted 
during the BEE exercise:
Board configuration and effectiveness
Working relationship between the Board 
and Senior Management
Oversight on sustainability/ESG
Leadership of the Board Chairman
Separately,	 the	 identified	 improvement	 markers	
focused on the Board composition, Board needs 
analysis for identifying suitable candidates and 
functionalities of the Board Committees. In 
November 2023, the Board resolved to adopt the 
BEE exercise results, as recommended by the 
NRC. In conjunction, the Board resolved to draw up 
concrete action plans to address the improvement 
considerations, as highlighted by the BEE exercise, 
all of which is in line with Duopharma Biotech’s 
unwavering goal of continuous improvement to 
better serve its stakeholders.
In addition to the BEE exercise and pursuant to

of Directors and Senior Management that was 
approved by the Board in January 2022.

Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE A: Board Leadership and EffectivenessA
Non-Executive Directors, save for the Non-Executive Non-
Independent Alternate Director, receive fees and allowances 
that commensurate with their responsibilities on the Board as 
well as on the Board Committees and it is designed to attract, 
incentivise, and retain high-performing individuals. Remuneration 
packages designed for Non-Executive Directors are based on 
their	individual	qualifications,	experience	and	competence	while	
being mindful of their responsibilities, time commitment and 
annual evaluation undertaken by the NRC. They are paid via 
fixed	directors	fees,	meeting	allowances	and	other	benefits	and	
there shall be no distinction between participation in-person or 
participation through electronic modalities. 
Recognising the heightened engagement necessitated of 
Directors over the course of recent years, the Board adopted a 
methodical approach to distinguish between informal and formal 
meetings for the purpose of according meeting allowances. 
In instances whereby the Company Secretary was present, 
and the meeting minutes were recorded, it would be declared 
a formal meeting for which Directors received the necessary 
allowance. In all other instances, meetings would be considered 
informal, with no allowance payable. The Board and the NRC 
periodically review the Remuneration Policy and Procedures for 
Directors and Senior Management. External experts are enlisted 
PRINCIPLE B: Effective Audit and Risk ManagementB
periodically, to facilitate in this exercise. The detailed disclosure 
of the remuneration of individual Directors are disclosed in the 
Company’s Corporate Governance Report under Practice 8.1. 
In relation to the GMD and other Senior Management personnel, 
their remuneration packages are set to be competitive, premised 
on the aim of attracting, retaining, and motivating executives of 
the highest calibre needed to manage the Group competently. As 
such, remuneration is closely linked to performance measured 
through the achievements of individual key performance 
indicators.

1 Muhammad Shukri Bin Ismail ceased to be a Non-Independent Non-
Executive Alternate Director to Amizar Binti Mizuar and was subsequently 
appointed as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Alternate Director to Mohd 
Haris Bin Mohd Arshad with effect from 20 March 2024.
Audit Committee 
The wholly independent AC is headed by Razalee Bin Amin 
and by design, this position is distinct from the Chairman of 
the Board. The remaining members of the AC are Datuk Nik 
Moustpha Bin Haji Nik Hassan, and Zaiton Binti Jamaluddin, 
both whom are also Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
The AC is reposed with the responsibility of ensuring that there 
is	robust	oversight	 over	financial	 reporting,	 external	 audit	and	
internal audit matters concerning Duopharma Biotech and its 
subsidiaries. In exercising its functions, the AC is generally not 
delegated with decision-making powers that curtails the Board’s 
ultimate	 statutory	 and	 fiduciary	 responsibility	 for	 decision-
making. The AC is expected to report its recommendations to 
the	Board	for	the	final	decision.
During the year under review, the AC reviewed and recommended 
for approval the revised Policy on External Auditors in relation 
to non-audit services. Moreover, the External Auditor Evaluation 
Form has been updated to assess the credibility of the external 
audit	 firm,	 adequacy	 of	audit	 scope,	 reasonableness	 of	audit	
fees, competency of the lead engagement partner, and 
timeliness in escalating audit issues to the AC. This revision 
aims to enable the AC to conduct a comprehensive and fair 
annual evaluation of the external auditors.
The	AC	reviewed	 the	finance	 function	 of	Duopharma	 Biotech	
group to ensure the resources and expertise within the Finance 
Department were equipped with the necessary skills and 
experience	to	effectively	fulfil	its	duties	that	commensurate	 with	
the complexity of the business operations.
Duopharma Biotech’s internal audit function is undertaken 
by the in-house Group Internal Audit (“GIA”), which is a 
crucial element in the monitoring of internal governance of 
the Group. The internal audit function, being the third line of 
defence, is responsible for providing independent assessment 
of compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies, and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
risk management systems, internal controls, and governance 
processes. It is headed by the Head of GIA who has direct 
access to the Board through the Chairman of the AC, to whom 
the Head of GIA reports to, directly and functionally. The GIA 
only maintains a perforated line of reporting to the GMD on 
administrative matters. The AC receives regular reports on the 
findings	by	the	internal	audit	function	and	recommendations	 of	
actions to be carried out.

PRINCIPLE B: Effective Audit and Risk ManagementB
Based on the AC’s score in the BEE 2023, the AC had 
performed relatively well, with a higher BEE result than that 
of the preceding year. In line with a suggestion from the BEE 
2023, the AC members will remain informed about the evolving 
complexities of tax regulations and legislation, both domestically 
and globally. This proactive approach ensures that the AC 
members are well-versed in how these changes might affect 
the	financials	and	operations	of	Duopharma	Biotech	in	2024.	By	
staying abreast of these developments, the AC can effectively 
anticipate challenges and implement strategies to mitigate 
potential risks and optimise the company’s performance in the 
coming year.
Risk Management and Internal Control Framework
The Board is mindful of its cardinal responsibility and oversight 
role over the Group’s risk management and system of internal 
controls and endeavours to keep abreast of developments in the 
areas of risk and governance. The risk management and control 
processes are implemented by Senior Management, led by the 
GMD and other Senior Management personnel of the Group, 
who are collectively responsible for prudent risk management 
and sound business practices.
The Board has established the RMC that is tasked with 
determining the Group’s level of risk tolerance and actively 
identify, assess, and monitor key business risks to safeguard 
shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets. The focus 
areas pertaining to risk were namely the changing political 
environment, economic conditions, supply chain, strategic 
objectives, and regulatory requirements. The risk management 
function is carried out by the Group Risk Management and 
Integrity (“GRMI”) department which escalates reports to the 
RMC, provides advice and supports the Board and Executive 
Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”) in all matters of 
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”). 
The GIA assists the AC and the Board to perform regular 
reviews on compliance of operational procedures using a risk-
based audit approach. The GIA also conducts investigations 
on	specific	 areas	or	issues	 as	directed	 by	the	AC	and	Senior	
Management. The annual audit plan is reviewed and approved 
by the AC. The scope as well as frequency of the audit coverage 
are determined in tandem with the level of assessed risks, in 
view of providing an independent and objective report on the 
operational and management activities of these functions.
Taking a step further to the Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, 
aside	 from	 the	 GMD	 and	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer	 (“CFO”),	 all	
other Senior Management of Duopharma Biotech provided 
assurances to the Board that the Company’s risk management 
and internal control systems were operating adequately and 
effectively during the year under review. This allows the Board 
to	receive	assurance,	not	just	from	the	operational	and	financial	
aspect of the Group, but also on commercial, corporate, 
technical, manufacturing, sustainability, legal and consumer 
healthcare matters.
More information is outlined within the Report of the AC, available 
on page 128 of the Integrated Annual Report. The Statement of 
Risk Management and Internal Control which provides details 
of the internal review, is outlined on pages 150 to 160 of the 
Integrated Annual Report. 
Communication with Stakeholders
The Board is cognisant of its corporate accountability to 
stakeholders	 and	 ensures	 high	 level	 of	 efficacy	 in	 the	 form,	
frequency, and timeliness of its engagement with stakeholders. 
Duopharma Biotech goes the extra mile in its communication with 
stakeholders, to share meaningful insights to augment formal 
disclosures. The Board is committed to ensuring shareholders 
and stakeholders are well-informed and are enabled to input 
feedback and share concerns with the Board. The Integrated 
Annual Report contains a balanced, comparable, and meaningful 
assessment of the Group’s position and prospects as well as 
PRINCIPLE C: Integrity in Corporate Reporting and Meaningful Relationship with StakeholdersC
comprehensive details about business activities as well as 
financial	and	non-financial	performance	for	the	financial	year. 	
Well-defined	 channels	of	communication	 with	stakeholders	 are	
established, namely the corporate website, announcements 
on	the	Exchange,	 briefing	 sessions,	 roadshows,	 conferences,	
media releases and social media platforms. In compliance with 
MMLR and Corporate Disclosure Guide from Bursa Malaysia 
Berhad, the Board issues quarterly statements in a timely manner 
to shareholders and stakeholders on Duopharma Biotech’s 
performance. In addition, the GMD and the Chief Financial 
Officer	conducts	quarterly	analyst	and	investor	briefings.

Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement
PRINCIPLE C: Integrity in Corporate Reporting and Meaningful Relationship with StakeholdersC
Recognising the importance of effective engagement and 
communication with the Group’s employees, Duopharma Biotech 
carries out an Employee Engagement Index (“EEI”) survey on 
an annual basis to gauge the level of employees’ motivation 
and engagement as well as the demonstration of Duopharma 
Biotech’s Core Values in their daily interaction with each other.  
Flowing from this commitment the EEI was conducted in October 
2023 with relative results of 88%, demonstrating alignment to 
global high performing norms.
During the year under review, the Group had undertaken four 
(4)	 investor	 briefing	 sessions.	 On	 top	 of	 this,	 Duopharma	
Biotech had also conducted investor relation sessions by 
invitation with Credit Suisse Securities (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd. By 
and	large,	the	Company	conducts	broad	based	briefings	to	the	
investment	community	as	opposed	to	targeted,	ad-hoc	briefings	
given the importance it places on information parity. The Group 
issued quarterly publications of press information via Exchange 
announcements	 disseminating	 the	 Group’s	 financial	 results,	
prospects, and milestones to communicate meaningful insights 
into the company business with stakeholders.
Virtual townhall sessions were also conducted by the GMD, or 
in	his	absence,	 the	Chief	Executive	 Officer	-	Commercial	 with	
the Group’s employees, typically after the Company’s quarterly 
statements have been approved by the Board and announced 
to the Exchange. These townhalls provide an opportunity for 
Management to engage with the employees including to share 
the	latest	financial	performance	 of	the	Group,	human	resource	
and sustainability updates, and other initiatives, strategies and 
achievements. Employees are encouraged to ask questions or 
provide feedback during these townhall sessions.  
Conduct of General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) serves as the primary 
modality at which the Board and Senior Management 
communicate with shareholders. Shareholders are encouraged 
to actively participate in discussions on proposed resolutions and 
future developments of the Group, as well as provide feedback 
on performance. The Board views the AGM as a pertinent event, 
where Directors, Senior Management and the Company’s 
external auditors are present to participate in the question-and-
answer	session	to	provide	clarification	to	shareholders.
The	process	 Is	fortified	 through	 poll	 voting	 for	all	resolutions	
tabled, with the voting results and procedures validated by 
an independent scrutineer. The voting results are disclosed 
immediately (i.e., percentage of shareholders approving, 
dissenting, and abstaining) for all the resolutions that are tabled. 
In continuation of the achievements of the 20 th and 21 st Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) and the Board’s emphasis on effective 
governance, the 22 nd AGM, conducted on 31 May 2023, was 
held virtually through live streaming. This approach aimed to 
encourage increased shareholder engagement and improve the 
conduct of the General Meeting. Duopharma Biotech’s AGM 
was conducted in line with promulgations as contained within 
the MCCG and Securities Commission Malaysia’s Guidance on 
the Conduct of General Meetings for Listed Issuers. 
The notice of AGM issued by the Company provided transparent 
and comprehensive guidance, emphasising the importance 
of shareholder engagement. Duopharma Biotech actively 
encouraged shareholders to submit their questions ahead of 
and during the AGM, ensuring ample opportunity for dialogue 
and participation. Additionally, Tricor Investor & Issuing House 
Services Sdn Bhd (“Tricor”), was appointed as the designated 
poll administrator and Scrutineer Solutions Sdn Bhd as scrutineer 
to verify the results of each resolution, thereby enhancing the 
integrity and transparency of the AGM proceedings.
Since the onset of the pandemic, this AGM marked the fourth 
occasion where the Company conducted a fully virtual meeting, 
allowing shareholders to participate and vote remotely, thus 
democratising the process. Further fortifying objectivity 
into the AGM and as with the preceding year, Duopharma 
Biotech engaged an independent moderator, namely KPMG 
Management & Risk Consulting Sdn Bhd, to streamline 
questions raised by shareholders during the general meeting 
as well as pre-submitted questions. In addition to the Notice of 
the AGM, an Administrative Guide was issued as a reference 
for shareholders in navigating the roll-out of the virtual AGM. 
Immediately on conclusion of the 22 nd Virtual AGM a survey was 
conducted that sought shareholders’ feedback of the same, and 
a	media	briefing	was	also	held	to	furnish	other	stakeholders	 at	
large with a comprehensive and factual representation of the 
Company. 
The Company Secretary recorded feedback and responses 
to shareholders’ queries during the AGM. In the scenario that 
substantive information is needed to respond to shareholders’ 
queries during the AGM, the Company Secretary provides a 
written response that is subsequently uploaded onto Duopharma 
Biotech’s corporate website. Minutes of the previous AGM are 
made available on the corporate website within 30 business 
days upon conclusion of the proceedings. The latest 22 nd AGM 
minutes have been uploaded onto the Group’s corporate website:

As a standard practice, notice for the upcoming AGMs will be 
issued at least 28 days before the AGM to enable shareholders 
to make adequate preparations. In the event special business 
items appear in the Notice of AGM, a full explanation is provided 
to shareholders on the effects of the proposed resolution arising 
from such items. Helpdesks are also set up for shareholders 
during the AGM in case of further operational queries.
FOCUS AREAS DURING THE YEAR (2023)
In 2023, the corporate governance focus areas of Duopharma 
Biotech constituted the following:
In a strategic move aimed at enhancing organisational 
governance and risk management effectiveness, 
Duopharma Biotech transferred its integrity function from the 
Internal Audit to Risk Management. This decision marks a 
deliberate effort to reinforce the integrity oversight within the 
framework of risk management, highlighting Duopharma's 
commitment to upholding ethical standards and mitigating 
operational risks comprehensively. By integrating the 
integrity function with the Group Risk Management and 
Integrity (“GRMI”) department, Duopharma Biotech aims 
to foster a more holistic approach to risk management, 
ensuring that integrity considerations are seamlessly 
embedded into decision-making processes across all 
levels of the organisation. Furthermore, this restructuring 
also ensures that the Internal Audit function maintains 
its independence, allowing it to carry out its duties with 
impartiality and rigour.
To this end, all integrity policies, including the Anti-
Bribery Management Systems, have been transferred to 
the oversight of the GRMI department. This realignment 
ensures that integrity issues are addressed within the 
broader context of risk management strategy and oversight. 
As part of these changes, the Whistleblowing Policy has 
been	updated	to	reflect	the	relocation	of	the	integrity	office	
to	the	GRMI’s	department	office	based	in	Bangi.
This	strategic	realignment	 reflects	Duopharma's	 dedication	
to strengthening its governance framework and ensuring 
sustainable growth in an ever-evolving business landscape.
Recognising the dynamic nature of corporate governance 
and the evolving landscape of best practices, the Board 
remains committed to ensuring that its policies and 
procedures	 reflect	 current	 and	 ongoing	 standards	 and	
practices of the Company. In line with this commitment, 
comprehensive reviews and revisions were carried out 
on the Board Charter and Terms of Reference of Board 
Committees	during	the	financial	year.	These	reviews	aimed	
not only to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
but	 also	 to	 enhance	 the	 effectiveness	 and	 efficiency	 of	
Board	operations.	Specifically,	efforts	were	made	to	identify	
and eliminate any unnecessary overlaps or redundancies 
in the roles and responsibilities outlined in these policies.
In addition to the Board Charter and Terms of Reference of 
Board Committees, Duopharma Biotech has implemented 
a separate Directors’ Code of Ethics. This initiative aims 
to elevate the level of corporate governance and ethical 
behaviour, setting clear standards for Directors’ conduct 
including	 in	 the	 area	 of	 avoiding	 conflict	 of	 interest.	 It	
also underscores the Company’s commitment to social 
responsibility and accountability, aligning with relevant 
legislation, regulations, and industry guidelines. 
By streamlining the governance framework in this 
manner, the Board seeks to optimise its decision-making 
processes, promote clarity in roles and expectations, and 
ultimately, enhance the overall governance structure of 
the organisation. This proactive approach underscores the 
Board’s dedication to upholding the highest standards of 
governance and fostering sustainable long-term value for 
stakeholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRIORITIES
Continuing its steadfast commitment, the Board of Duopharma Biotech remains dedicated to integrating ESG considerations 
deeply into the fabric of its diverse operational landscape, aligning with prevailing regional and global trends. Duopharma Biotech 
acknowledges that ESG practices are an ongoing journey for the Company.
To navigate this path effectively, Duopharma has devised a comprehensive 5-year ESG strategy aimed at guiding and facilitating 
the	company	 in	fulfilling	 its	sustainability	 commitments	 and	targets,	 including	 climate	 risk	management.	 Targets	and	objectives	
have been set, including achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2030, Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050, maintaining listing in the 
FTSE4Good Index, aligning with investor and shareholder expectations, adhering to the Bursa Malaysia Enhanced Sustainability 
Reporting Framework, and meeting sustainability-related regulations. The Company remains vigilant in continuing its progress and 
achieving the targets outlined in its 5-year ESG strategy, with a particular emphasis on Short-Term Strategy for the period spanning 
2022 to 2023.
Furthermore,	 during	the	fiscal	year	in	review,	Duopharma	 Biotech	 made	a	strategic	 investment	 in	The	Live	Green	Group,	Inc.,	
indicating	 its	 commitment	 to	advancing	 sustainability	 initiatives.	 This	 investment	 signifies	 Duopharma	 Biotech’s	 dedication	 to	
exploring opportunities that align its operations with environmentally conscious practices. Duopharma Biotech has also approved 
the Net Zero Transition Plan which denotes the Company’s long-term commitment to achieving carbon neutrality and reducing 
its environmental footprint. In addition to this, the Company has taken further steps in its sustainability efforts by approving the 
installation	of	solar	panels	at	all	its	manufacturing	 plants.	This	decision	reflects	a	proactive	approach	to	reducing	carbon	emissions	
and dependence on non-renewable energy sources.
Duopharma Biotech remains acutely aware of the challenges posed by potential new accounting standards arising from ESG 
initiatives. As the landscape of corporate reporting continues to evolve, driven by increasing demands for transparency and 
sustainability, the Company recognises the importance of staying abreast of emerging accounting standards that may impact its 
financial	 reporting	 practices.	 By	proactively	 monitoring	 and	assessing	 these	developments,	 Duopharma	 Biotech	 aims	to	ensure	
that its accounting processes remain robust and aligned with evolving ESG requirements, thereby reinforcing its commitment to 
transparency and accountability in corporate governance.
Environmental, Social and Governance Considerations
In	enhancing	efficiency	within	the	Boardroom	of	Duopharma	Biotech,	the	Board	Committees	are	empowered	with	the	authority	to	
review and approve relevant matters at Board Committee meetings. This strategic delegation is aimed to expedite decision-making 
processes and minimise the volume of issues necessitating direct approval from the Board. By entrusting the Board Committees 
with this responsibility, discussions at the Board level shall be more focused and meaningful, ensuring that critical matters receive 
adequate attention. Additionally, any decisions made by the respective Board Committees are systematically reported to the Board 
for notation, fostering transparency and accountability.
In undertaking these reforms, Duopharma Biotech conducted a comprehensive review and market analysis of practices adopted 
by other Public Listed Companies. This analysis enabled the Company to benchmark its decision-making processes against 
industry standards and identify opportunities for improvement, thereby further optimising the governance practices and enhancing 
organisational effectiveness.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
COMMITTEE FOCUS IN FY2023
In carrying out their functions and duties, the AC members are 
guided by Duopharma Biotech’s overarching philosophy that 
requires its people to be responsible in performing their duties 
and responsibilities according to best practices, and to uphold 
the Company’s core values of Passion, Excellence, Teamwork, 
Integrity, Responsible and Respect (“PETIRR”). This culture 
of compliance and being responsible includes continuously 
improving practices to enhance the accountability, transparency 
and sustainability of the Duopharma Biotech Group.
The AC’s responsibilities and duties are outlined in its Terms 
of	Reference.	 During	 the	 financial	 year	 under	 review,	the	AC	
focused	on	matters	pertaining	to	the	Company’s	audit,	financial	
statements and performance, as well as operational matters. In 
2023, the AC provided oversight over governance and adherence 
to international accounting standards, and took note of further 
developments to the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“MIA”) 
and International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants 
(“IESBA”)’s by-laws on the Non-Assurance Services Provisions. 
In this context, the AC considers the provisions of Non-Assurance 
Services to Duopharma Biotech’s controlling entity, Permodalan 
Nasional Berhad. The AC also reviewed the establishment of 
the Islamic Syariah Compliant Sukuk Programme as well as the 
Finance function of Duopharma Biotech Berhad Group.
As part of its remit, the AC keeps under review the suitability, 
objectivity, independence and effectiveness of the external 
auditors	to	safeguard	the	quality	and	reliability	of	audited	financial	
statements.	During	the	financial	year	under	review,	it	endorsed	
the revisions to the Policy on External Auditors that included the 
establishment of enhanced procedures on provisions of Non-
Assurance Services to Duopharma Biotech’s controlling entity; the 
introduction of a revised methodology for two-stage assessment 
of external auditors to ensure their fair and objective assessment; 
as well as revision to the de minimis exceptions on provisions of 
Non-Assurance	 Services	 that	improve	administrative	 efficiency	
and allow Duopharma Biotech to channel such resources towards 
attaining other corporate objectives and business opportunities 
available to the Duopharma Group. The AC conducted the 
External Auditor Evaluation for the year 2023, taking into account 
emerging and leading practises derived from the roles and 
responsibilities of external auditors outlined in Bursa Securities’ 
MMLR and the MCCG, as well as other relevant provisions such as 
the Malaysian Institute of Accountants’ By-Laws (on Professional 
Ethics, Conduct and Practice) and information published in the 
External	Auditors’	Annual	Transparency	Report	for	the	financial	
year ended 31 December 2022, that includes the external audit 
firm’s	governance	and	leadership	structure,	as	well	as	its	efforts	
to	maintain	audit	quality	and	manage	risks.	The	AC	was	satisfied	
with the work performed by the external auditors based on the 
quality	 of	their	 service,	 sufficiency	 of	resources,	 performance,	
independence and professionalism, and their ability to conduct 
the	external	audit	within	an	agreed	timeline	fixed	by	Management.
Recognising the importance of independent judgement in effective 
oversight and monitoring, and guided by its commitment to ethical 
business operations in compliance with laws and regulations, the 
AC reviewed and deliberated on a quarterly basis:
• Significant	 accounting	 policies	 and	 newly	 effective	 auditing	
standards, in particular on the Deferred Tax Related to Assets 
and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments 
to MFRS 112);
• Key amendments to the International Ethics Standards Board 
for Accountants (“IESBA”) Code of Ethics;
• Any	 financial	 anomalies	 or	 irregularities	 in	 the	 financial	
statements, estimates and judgments made by the 
Management Team; and
• Technical	and	regulatory	matters	that	could	affect	the	financial	
statements for implementation.
In conjunction with risk oversight, the AC reviews and evaluates 
the effectiveness of risk management, internal control and 
governance processes as well as any operational issue that could 
potentially affect the Company’s performance as highlighted by 
the Group Internal Auditor (“the GIA”) or external auditors which 
appears to be beyond its risk appetite. 
With effect from 1 April 2023, the integrity function relating 
to anti-corruption and whistleblowing as well as the integrity 
issues previously under the purview of AC were transferred 
to the Risk Management Committee following a review of the 
Board Committees by the Board, which included a gap and 
benchmarking exercise on 1 July 2022.
In relation to the recent amendments to the MMLR that enhanced 
the AC’s function including to review and report to the Board on 
situations	that	arose,	persisted,	or	may	arise	during	the	financial	
year, as well as measures to resolve, eliminate, or mitigate such 
conflicts,	and	save	in	relation	to	related	party	transactions	 and	
recurrent related party transactions of a revenue nature that 
were	regularly	identified	and	reviewed	by	the	AC	in	accordance	
with the Company’s Related Party Transaction Framework, 
no	 material	 conflict	 of	 interest	 (“COI”)	 or	 potential	 COI	 were	
identified	 or	reported	 to	the	AC	during	the	year	under	review,	
save	for	the	potential	conflict	of	interest	that	may	arise	from	Tan	
Sri Datin Paduka Siti Sa’diah Binti Sh Bakir, Datuk Mohd Radzif 
Bin Mohd Yunus, Puan Amizar Binti Mizuar (resigned with effect 
from 20 March 2024), Encik Mohd Haris Bin Mohd Arshad and 
Encik Muhammad Shukri Bin Ismail being Nominee Directors of 
Permodalan Nasional Berhad (“PNB”), a major shareholder of 
Duopharma	Biotech.	The	aforesaid	potential	conflict	of	interest	is	
mitigated by the Nominee Directors abstaining from deliberation 
and voting on any transaction involving any member of the 
Duopharma Biotech Group that involves the interest of PNB or 
persons connected to PNB.

Report of the  
Audit Committee
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The performance of the AC was assessed as part of the  
Board Effectiveness Evaluation during the year under review 
(“BEE 2023”). Based on the AC’s score in BEE 2023, the AC 
performed relatively well.
Adopting a recommendation from BEE 2021, the AC members 
were	 given	 the	 liberty	 at	the	 conclusion	 of	the	 financial	 year	
under review to plot forward-looking agenda items (also known 
as “annual missions”) for the entire calendar year 2024 ahead of 
schedule, facilitated by the Company Secretary. This provided a 
way to proactively solicit input from all AC members in order to 
formulate the AC’s agenda.
BOARD COMMITTEE EVALUATION
A. FINANCIAL REPORTING MATTERS
i. Reviewed the Company’s quarterly reports in respect of 
the results for the quarters ended 31 December 2022, 
31 March 2023, 30 June 2023 and 30 September 2023 
to ensure compliance with the Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards and regulatory requirements, and 
recommended to the Board for subsequent release to 
Bursa Malaysia.
ii. Reviewed the notes to the draft announcements of 
the	 audited	 and	 unaudited	 financial	 statements	 to	
Bursa Malaysia, to ensure compliance with regulatory 
requirements.
iii.	 Reviewed	the	external	auditors’	report	for	the	financial	
year ended 31 December 2022, including matters relating 
to adjustments arising from the external audit review 
and adequacy of disclosures, prior to recommending 
for	 the	 Board’s	 approval.	 No	 significant	 adjustments	
were	required	 to	the	financial	 statements,	 which	were	
presented in a true and fair manner.
B. EXTERNAL AUDIT MATTERS
i. During the year, two (2) formal private sessions were 
held with the external auditors on 8 March 2023 and 1 
November 2023 without the presence of Management 
to discuss and review matters of concern and deliberate 
on observations highlighted by the external auditors, 
and the respective Management action plans and 
status updates. No major concerns were raised by the 
external auditors at these meetings.
ii. Deliberated on issues and reservations arising from the 
interim	and	final	audits,	and	any	matter	that	the	external	
auditors wished to discuss without the presence of 
Management.
SUMMARY OF WORK DONE DURING THE YEAR
As part of the Committee members’ continuing professional 
development, all members of the AC attended various 
conferences, seminars and training programmes to enhance 
their knowledge and technical competencies in their respective 
fields	of	expertise	in	order	to	efficiently	discharge	their	duties	as	
Directors of the Company. 
CONTINUING TRAINING
Directors of the Company. Details of the training and professional courses 
undertaken during the year are disclosed in the Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement on pages 103 to 127.
In 2024, the AC has reviewed and reported to the Board on 
potential	or	perceived	COI	that	were	identified	to	date	pursuant	to	
annual declaration of interest by directors of Duopharma Biotech 
and its subsidiaries, as well as measures to resolve, eliminate, or 
mitigate	such	conflicts.	No	material	COI	was	identified,	save	for	
potential	conflict	of	interest	involving	Tan	Sri	Datin	Paduka	Siti	
Sa’diah BInti Sh Bakir and Dato’ Dr Zaki Morad Bin Mohamad 
Zaher that may arise from the legal proceeding that has been 
commenced by KPJ Healthcare Berhad (“KPJ”) and its wholly-
owned subsidiary, Kumpulan Perubatan (Johor) Sdn. Bhd. 
(collectively the “Plaintiffs”) against 11 former directors of KPJ, 
including Tan Sri Datin Paduka Siti Sa’diah and Dato’ Dr Zaki 
Morad, as the Duopharma Biotech Group supplies from time to 
time pharmaceutical and healthcare products to pharmacies and 
hospitals	under	the	KPJ	group.	The	aforesaid	potential	conflict	of	
interest is mitigated as follows:-
i. such supplies of pharmaceutical and healthcare products 
by the Duopharma Biotech Group are in the ordinary course 
of business and usually handled by the Management of 
Duopharma Biotech Group at the operational level; and
ii. since the commencement of the aforesaid legal suit, there 
was no transaction between any member of the KPJ group 
and any member of the Duopharma Biotech Group that 
required deliberation by the Board of Directors of Duopharma 
Biotech. In the event any transaction between any member 
of the KPJ group and any member of the Duopharma 
Biotech Group is deliberated at the level of the Board of 
Directors of Duopharma Biotech after the commencement 
of the aforesaid legal suit, Tan Sri Datin Paduka Siti Sa’diah 
and Dato’ Dr Zaki Morad would abstain from deliberation 
and voting on the said transaction.
Minutes of the AC meetings were circulated to all members, and 
matters arising from the discussions and decisions made were 
escalated to relevant Management in charge for updates and 
action. Following each meeting, the Chairman of the AC provided 
a summary report to the Board of Duopharma Biotech, highlighting 
significant	points	on	the	decisions	and	recommendations	made.

the risk management systems, internal controls and governance 
processes. 
The Head of the GIA function reports directly to the AC to promote 
independence and to enable it to maintain objectivity in rendering 
unbiased judgements.
(i) REPORTING LINE
 The internal audit function’s purpose, authority and 
responsibilities are stated in the Internal Audit Charter, 
which is approved by the AC. The internal audit function is 
responsible for undertaking regular and systematic risk-based 
assessments of the internal control of the Duopharma Biotech 
Group so as to provide reasonable assurance that such 
systems are adequate and continue to operate effectively in 
managing Duopharma Biotech Group’s key risks.
(ii) AUDIT PLANNING AND WORK DONE
 The Annual Internal Audit Plan, formulated by the GIA based 
on the business operations risk assessment and the audit 
cycle, was approved by the AC. GIA adopts the COSO Internal 
Control Framework in conducting the audit assignments, which 
covered	five	(5)	elements	of	internal	controls,	namely	Control	
Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information 
and Communication, and Monitoring.
 In 2023, the GIA issued 13 audit reports covering operational 
and ad-hoc matters, amongst others, Recurrent Related Party 
Transactions Compliance Review, COVID19 Vaccines Sales & 
Distribution Management, Kelab PETIRR Duopharma Biotech 
(Financial & Compliance), Follow-Up on the Trademark Audit, 
Corruption Risk Management Controls, and Group Human 
Resources Management. The Internal Audit Reports, which 
included issues and action plans, were presented to and 
discussed with Management. GIA subsequently monitored 
the implementation of the agreed action plans to ensure full 
compliance. The reports, together with follow-up action plans 
and implementation status, were presented to the AC for its 
deliberation and subsequent approval.
 The performance of the GIA function was presented to the AC 
on a quarterly basis.
(iii) INTERNAL AUDIT COST
	 The	 GIA	function’s	total	expenditure	for	the	financial	year,	
including	 departmental	 expenditure	 such	 as	 office	 running	
expenses, training expenses, travelling expenses, staff 
remuneration, etc., is estimated at RM RM1,070,528.46. 
Further details of the activities of the Group Internal Audit 
Department are set out in the Statement on Risk Management and 
Internal Control on pages 150 to 160 of this Annual Report.
The AC is supported by the Group Internal Audit Department (“GIA”) 
in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. In the Three Lines 
of	Defence	model,	Management	control	is	the	first	line	of	defence	
in risk management; the various risk control and compliance 
oversight functions established by Management are the second 
line of defence; and independent assurance is the third. Each of 
these three “lines” plays a distinct role within the organisation’s 
wider governance framework. The Internal Audit function, being 
the third line of defence, is responsible for providing independent 
assessment of compliance with existing laws/regulations, policies 
and procedures, and reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of

REPORT OF THE NOMINATION AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Report of the  
Nomination and Remuneration Committee
During the year under review, the NRC recommended a 
revision to its Terms of Reference in view of Paragraph 10 of 
the Terms of Reference of the NRC, which requires periodical 
reviews. One objective was to delegate some approval authority 
as appropriate to the NRC to accelerate the decision-making 
process and reduce the volume of matters required to be tabled 
to the Board for approval.
In view of the retirement of Dato’ Mohamad Kamarudin from the 
Board of the Company at the Company’s 22 nd Annual General 
Meeting, the NRC reviewed and recommended a change in 
the composition of the Board and Board Committees with the 
appointment of Dato’ Eisah Binti A Rahman as the new Senior 
Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and the 
appointment of Datin Paduka Kartini Binti Hj Abdul Manaf as an 
Independent Non-Executive Director in place of Dato’ Mohamad 
Kamarudin, based on the Company’s selection criteria. In 
August 2023, the NRC again reviewed and recommended a 
change in the composition of the Board of Directors considering 
the appointment of a Non-Independent Non-Executive Alternate 
Director to Puan Amizar Binti Mizuar, Encik Muhammad Shukri 
Bin Ismail.
The NRC conducted an annual review of the Company’s Board 
Succession Plan Framework based on a Board Needs Analysis 
from	the	Board’s	existing	key	competencies	 and	identified	gaps	
to ensure that the best candidates are selected. In addition to 
the Company’s internal registry and referrals from the major 
shareholder,	 the	Company	utilises	 an	independent	 search	firm	
to	source	suitable	 and	qualified	 candidates	 based	on	Practice	
5.6 of the MCCG.
With respect to the NRC’s duties in relation to the human 
resources function, the NRC reviewed and recommended the 
establishment of the Company’s Diversity, Anti-Discrimination 
and Anti-Harassment Policy in line with the announcement by

We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
Briefly,	 all	 nominations	 for	 appointment	 or	 re-election	 as	
Directors	 of	 the	 Company	 are	 first	 tabled	 to	 and	 deliberated	
by the NRC, which takes into consideration requirements 
enumerated in the Companies Act 2016, the MMLR, the 
Company’s Constitution, as well as the Company’s policies 
and procedures, including the Board Charter, Diversity Policy, 
Fit and Proper Policy, Remuneration Policy, Succession Plan 
Policy and the Succession Plan Framework. Subject to the 
Board’s and the NRC’s review and discretion on the aforesaid 
requirements, nominations for appointment may come from 
shareholders, Directors or third parties. The Company also 
utilises	an	independent	search	firm	in	addition	to	the	Company’s	
internal directors’ registry in searching for board member 
candidates.
If	 the	 NRC	 is	 satisfied,	 after	 such	 deliberation,	 that	 the	
candidate/Director	 is	fit	and	proper	to	be	appointed	or	re-elected	
as a Director, the NRC recommends the same to the Board for 
its further deliberation and approval. The re-election of any 
Director is subject to shareholders’ approval at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.
REPORT OF THE NOMINATION AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Company’s Succession Plan Policy for Non-Executive 
Directors was developed based on Guidance 1.1 and Practice 
5.5 of the updated MCCG, which recommends a formalised 
succession plan of at least 12 to 18 months with appropriate 
and clear succession models that are practicable to ensure a 
smooth leadership transition.
Appointment of a Board member should be based on objective 
criteria, merit and with due regard for diversity of skills, 
experience, age, cultural background and gender. Duopharma 
Biotech’s Succession Plan Policy aims to serve as a guide for 
the Board to administer a methodical process for the succession 
planning of its Non-Executive Directors. It seeks to ensure a 
robust succession plan by monitoring the Board composition 
needs and requirements whilst simultaneously identifying high-
calibre and suitable candidates for the Company. The policy also 
aims to clarify the key roles and responsibilities of the Board, 
the NRC and the Company Secretary in the Non-Executive 
Directors succession planning procedures. Further, it sets out 
the guiding principles and practices for the Board’s succession 
plan by taking into account growing regulatory demands, 
complexities and expectations reposed on the Company as well 
as the envisaged skillsets, experience and roles of the Non-
Executive Directors.
The Succession Plan Policy is guided by a Succession Plan 
Framework	 to	 better	 define	 action	 plans	 for	 the	 successful	
transition of Non-Executive Directors other than to ensure 
that the necessary talents, skills, essential knowledge and 
experience are maintained.
SUCCESSION PLAN POLICY, SUCCESSION PLAN 
FRAMEWORK FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS,  
AND THE BOARD NOMINATION AND ELECTION 
PROCESS AND CRITERIA USED BY THE NRC IN THE 
SELECTION PROCESS
In 2022, the Company established the Fit and Proper Policy 
for the Board of Directors and Senior Management for the 
appointment of directors and senior management and re-
election of directors as required by Paragraph 15.01A of the 
MMLR issued by Bursa Malaysia.
This policy addresses the application of Paragraph 2.20A of 
the MMLR that requires every listed corporation to ensure that 
each	 of	its	 directors,	 chief	 executive	 or	chief	 financial	 officer	
has the character, experience, integrity, competence and time to 
effectively discharge his or her role as a director, chief executive 
or	chief	financial	officer.
The	 Diversity	 Policy	 reflects	 the	 Company’s	 commitment	
to promote diversity and inclusion in the Board and Senior 
Management and sets out the guiding principles and practices 
which underpin the Company’s approach to instituting a diverse 
Board and Senior Management team. It encompasses various 
areas including, but not limited to, diversity of gender, age, 
cultural background, education, business and industry skills and 
experience.

(i) PRINCIPLES 
 The Company’s Diversity Policy is anchored by the following principles:-
(ii) DIVERSITY FRAMEWORK
 In promoting diversity, the Company has set objectives at the Board and Senior Management levels. The diversity considerations 
are set at the leadership level to set the tone for organisational-wide initiatives with a view of imbuing cognitive variety during 
deliberations and decision-making as well as spurring innovation at all levels.
	 The	 Company	has	a	significant	proportion	of	women	directors,	which	exceeds	the	requirement	of	Paragraph	15.02	of	the	MMLR	
to have at least one (1) woman director.
(iii) MEASURES AND STRATEGIES
 The following are some measures and strategies that the Board, NRC and the GMD should undertake:-
(a) Gender diversity – to have at least 30% women Directors.
(b) Board Effectiveness Evaluation – to report annually on the outcomes of the Board evaluation exercise, the composition 
and structure of the Board as well as any issues and challenges the Board is facing when considering the diverse makeup 
of the Company.
(c)	 Age	diversity	–	to	acknowledge	the	benefits	of	having	a	diverse	boardroom	in	terms	of	age	demographics,	with	experience	
and maturity as well as youthful exuberance, and seek to eliminate age stereotyping or discrimination on age. Further, the 
age limit for Directors is set at 80 years;
(d)	 Ethnic	diversity	–	to	set	a	long-term	target	for	the	Board’s	ethnic	composition	to	reflect	the	country’s	ethnicity. 	
Board of Directors
(a) Gender diversity – When shortlisting candidates for Senior Management, the GMD ensures that at least one female 
candidate is considered.
(b) Progressive human capital policies – develop and oversee the implementation of appropriate policies, programmes and 
initiatives to build inclusion and promote diversity at the Senior Management level and monitor equal pay for equal 
work among selected Senior Management other than practising gender-neutral job openings in internal and external 
recruitments.
(c) Age diversity – whilst acknowledging that a wide range of ages for Senior Management individuals has the advantage 
of	creating	 a	dynamic	 and	multi-generational	 workforce	 with	diverse	 skillsets	 that	are	beneficial	 to	the	Company,	the	
Company	does	not	set	specific	targets	or	limits	on	the	age	of	Senior	Management	individuals.
Senior Management
the Company articulates 
its diversity efforts to focus 
on gender diversity at the 
leadership level to set the 
tone on an organisational 
basis.

Senior Management  that was established in 2022 in 
accordance with Paragraph 15.01A of the MMLR addresses 
the application of Paragraph 2.20A of the MMLR that 
requires every listed corporation to ensure that each of 
its	 directors,	 chief	 executive	 or	chief	 financial	 officer	 has	
the character, experience, integrity, competence and time 
to effectively discharge his or her role as a director, chief 
executive	or	chief	financial	officer.
(i) ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
 The Board and NRC are responsible for the application of 
this	policy	and	for	conducting	the	fit	and	proper	assessments.	
Meanwhile, the NRC is responsible for leading the review 
of the appropriate skills, experience and characteristics 
required of Board members and Senior Management 
through a set procedure.
(ii) FIT AND PROPER ASSESSMENT
 The Fit and Proper Policy of the Company outlines the 
baseline	 criteria	 for	 the	 fit	 and	 proper	 assessment	 for	
the Board of Directors and Senior Management. During 
the appointment stage, assessment shall be performed 
via diligence or screening (i.e., using established search 
databases or services as adopted by the Company from 
time to time) as well as declarations from the concerned 
individuals. Meanwhile, as for the re-election of Directors and 
re-appointment or contract renewal of Senior Management 
personnel, the assessment shall be performed based on a 
review of the BEE 2022 results and performance appraisal 
records.
(iii) FIT AND PROPER CRITERIA

capacity, Board members and Senior Management

 The Board members should also be able to discharge 
their roles with regard to other commitments and

 The adopted Fit and Proper Policy was applied by the NRC 
and the Board when it considered and deliberated the 
retirement by rotation of Directors and the recommendation 
for the proposed re-election of those Directors seeking 
re-election at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. The 
application	 of	the	Fit	and	Proper	Policy	also	served	to	fulfil

experience, integrity, competence and time to effectively

Directors seeking re-election, completed an evaluation 
of the respective Directors. The NRC and the Board had 
assessed individual Directors seeking re-election with due 
regard to, among others, the considerations listed in the 
Fit and Proper Policy by way of Fit and Proper assessment 
via diligence or screening (i.e., using established search 
databases or services as adopted by the Company from 
time to time) as well as declarations from the concerned 
individuals.
 Additionally, the assessment was also based on a review 
of the BEE results (in relation to the Directors seeking  
re-election). Following the said assessment, both the NRC 
and	 the	 Board	 were	 satisfied	 that	 the	 Directors	 seeking	 
re-election	were	fit	and	proper	to	be	re-elected	as	Directors

contributions and performance as well as in terms of

A.  STRATEGY AND CONFORMANCE TO HALAL STANDARDS 
MATTERS
i. Monitored the structure of Duopharma Biotech’s halal 
operations committees to ensure all facilities and 
manufactured	 products	 adhere	 to	 Halal	 Certification	
requirements.
SUMMARY OF WORK DONE DURING THE YEAR
Details of the trainings and professional courses undertaken during the 
year are disclosed in the Corporate Governance Overview Statement on 
pages 116 to 120.
Kemajuan Islam Malaysia (“JAKIM”) while stewarding the 
HPA. In line with the Group’s commitment to being a leader 
in the halal pharmaceuticals industry and in addressing the 
Muslim	 community’s	 concerns	 regarding	 halal	 certification	
of pharmaceutical products, the HSC oversees the Group's 
efforts	to	secure	halal	certification	 for	all	of	its	active	registered	
products manufactured at all Duopharma facilities. The HSC 
has also ensured that a robust and innovative Halal Assurance 
Management System continues to be implemented by adopting 
MyHalalGiG, a digital managerial platform and repository 
system. 
In conjunction with the Group’s dedication to enhancing external 
stakeholders’ awareness of the Company’s Halal Commitment, 
the HSC provides oversight and advisory for the Group’s 
national, regional and international communication outreach 
programme for healthcare professionals, academics and the 
public. The approach of the implemented programmes and 
initiatives is aligned with the Company’s ESG emphasis on 
“Access to Medicines” for customers and patients that includes 
access to halal-assured medicines for all for added comfort and 
confidence	 of	higher	 standards	 of	safety,	quality,	efficacy	 and	
hygiene.
The HSC recognises that, for companies to be resilient, boards 
need to take a much more holistic view of the business coupled 
with proactive and effective measures to anticipate and address 
material ESG risks and opportunities. Accordingly, the HSC 
reviewed and oversaw the development and implementation 
of the Group’s 5-Year ESG Strategy and sustainability 
commitments every quarter, where ESG Strategy updates is a 
fixed	agenda	item	and	tabled	for	review	and	deliberation	at	each	
Board meeting. This is to ensure the successful execution of the 
strategies and plans. Recognising the importance of employee 
well-being for business sustainability, the HSC also focuses 
on monitoring mental health and safety programmes while 
continuing to monitor the Group’s FTSE4Good ESG ratings to 
improve the overall rating.
During	the	financial	year	under	review,	the	HSC	considered	the	
Net Zero Transition Plan which outlines the strategic approach 
and key initiatives that will support Duopharma Biotech in 
meeting its climate-related pledges. HSC also reviewed the 
Group’s Business Continuity Management (“BCM”) based on 
requirements detailed in the ISO:22301 BCM system to manage 
and minimise disruptions to the Company’s prioritised activities 
in the event of any disruptive incident, maintaining an acceptable 
level of operations and services to safeguard the interests 
of key stakeholders. This is important to protect the Group’s 
reputation	 and	maintain	 customers’	trust	and	confidence.	 HSC	
monitored the BCM desktop exercise conducted to ensure 
business units across the Group understand the related process 
flow	and	appropriate	 response	 to	incidents.	 The	exercise	 also	
sought	to	identify	areas	for	improvement	in	a	specified	Business	
Continuity Plan and Incident/Crisis Management Plan (“ICMP”).
Minutes of the HSC meetings were circulated to all members, 
and matters arising from the discussions and decisions made 
were escalated to relevant Management in charge for updates 
and action. Following each meeting, the Chairman of the 
HSC provided a summary report to the Board of Duopharma 
Biotech,	 highlighting	 significant	 points	 on	 the	 decisions	 and	
recommendations made.

Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control
This Statement is made pursuant to Paragraph 15.26 (b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa 
Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) and is in line with the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021.
BOARD AND MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY 
The Board is responsible for the establishment of a sound 
risk management framework and internal control system for 
Duopharma Biotech and its subsidiaries (collectively “the 
Group”) as well as for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system. The framework and internal control system 
encompass	the	Group’s	financial,	risk	management,	operational,	
strategy, sustainability and compliance functions. In setting the 
tone for effective risk management and internal control, the 
Board seeks to create a culture for the Group and its people to 
take responsibility for performing their duties in line with best 
practices as they uphold the Company’s core values of Passion, 
Excellence, Teamwork, Integrity, Responsible and Respect 
(“PETIRR”). Such a culture entails continuously improving the 
Group’s practices to enhance its accountability, transparency 
and sustainability.
In executing its role, the Board recognises that a strong risk 
management and internal control governance structure and 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve the Group’s objectives. The Board recognises 
that the risk management and internal control systems can 
only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement, errors, fraud, loss or the occurrence of 
unforeseen circumstances.
To carry out its risk management and control oversight 
responsibilities effectively, the Board is assisted by the Risk 
Management Committee (“RMC”) and the Audit Committee 
(“AC”) which together oversee matters relating to risk oversight, 
compliance and internal controls as set out in the respective 
Terms of Reference (“TOR”). All risk and internal control 
related matters that require the attention of the Board were 
recommended by the RMC and AC for the Board’s deliberation 
and approval. The Board remains responsible for all the actions 
of the Board committees with regard to the execution of the 
delegated role.
The risk management and control processes established by 
the Board are implemented by the Management, led by the 
Group Managing Director (“GMD”). The GMD is responsible 
for the overall management of risks whereas the Management 
is collectively responsible for good business practices and 
governance across the business operations. Management’s 
role in this respect include:
(i) Designing, implementing and monitoring the risk 
management framework in accordance with the Company’s 
strategic vision and overall risk appetite and resourcing the 
same adequately;
(ii) Communicating the requirements of the risk management 
framework and ensuring continuous enhancement of 
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) annually or as and 
when required;
(iii) Identifying risks relevant to the Group’s business and the 
achievement of objectives and strategies;
(iv) Identifying changes to existing and emerging risks, with 
mitigation actions to address the risks and reporting to the 
Board on the changes in a timely manner; and 
(v) Reviewing the Risk Management Manual & Guidelines 
(“RMMG”) periodically and considering the adoption of best 
practices based on the Group’s corporate governance.
RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION
The RMC assists the Board in ensuring that there is a 
sound system of risk management and effective oversight of 
investment, integrity and whistleblowing practices within the 
Group and its subsidiaries. Deliberations and key decisions 
at all RMC meetings are minuted and tabled to the Board 
quarterly. The TOR of the RMC is incorporated in the Board 
Charter, which is accessible on the Company’s website at 
https://duopharmabiotech.com/esg/governance-and-policies/.
The RMC is supported by an in-house risk management 
function, however, effective 1 April 2023, the integrity function 
which was previously managed by Group Internal Audit had 
been transferred to the Group Risk Management and Integrity 
Department (“GRMI”), which now provides risk and integrity 
advisory and supports the Board and the Executive Risk 
Management Committee (“ERMC”) in all business matters.

(i) Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework 
 The Group’s Risk Management Manual and Guidelines, which comprises the ERM Framework, provides a standardised and 
systematic	approach	for	the	identification,	evaluation,	monitoring	and	reporting	of	key	risks	and	controls,	and	ensuring	there	are	
adequate measures to implement, track and review the action plans. It also comprises of digitalisation initiatives by identifying 
risk software namely Highbond, used in process. The Group’s ERM Framework is aligned with the internationally-recognised 
ISO31000:2009	Risk	Management	Principles	and	Guidelines	to	define	our	ERM	policy	and	objectives	and	to	develop	our	risk	
reporting	structure.	The	framework	includes	risk	profiling	of	historical	and	current	risks,	expectations	of	probable	or	associated	risks	
and opportunities in the future besides enhancing the capacity to build value for stakeholders and also the mitigating strategy in 
managing the risks to the acceptable level. The framework ties into the Group’s governance policies and guidelines via deliberations 
at various committees; and operates within the context of Strategic, Operational, Financial, Emerging and Project risk categories.

 The RMC receives reports from the ERMC, which is chaired by the GMD and comprises the Group Management Committee 
(“GMC”). The ERMC is assisted by Risk Champions consisting of Heads of Department and Senior Managers at all sites whose 
role is to identify, mitigate and manage risks within their respective departments. The Risk Champions have appointed Risk 
Coordinators	within	their	departments	to	enhance	the	risk	management	process	with	the	risk	owners.	This	reflects	the	Group’s	
overall risk governance structure which facilitates an appropriate level of independence and segregation of duties by distributing 
the accountability and ownership of risk management across three lines of defence.

and Internal Control
	 The	 first	 line	 of	 defence	 comprises	 Management,	 who	
controls the day-to-day risks inherent in business activities 
via effective internal controls, policies and procedures. 
Various established risk control and compliance functions 
serve as the second line of defence; while internal and 
external auditors who provide independent assurance on 
the overall integrity, adequacy and effectiveness of the risk 
management and internal control system noted during the 
risk evaluation process make up the third line of defence.

Group Risk Management & Integrity Department
Risk Management Committee
Executive Risk Management Committee
Risk Champion
Risk Coordinator
Risk Owner
 The focus is on the management of risks from any event 
or	uncertainty	that	may	have	a	significant	impact	on	the	
Group’s objectives. The risk management process includes 
risk	 identification,	 analysis,	 evaluation	 and	 treatment,	
with continuous monitoring, review, communication and 
consultation. Risk events are analysed in terms of their 
likelihood and impact of their occurrence, using an approved 
Risk Matrix to ensure consistency in risk practices throughout 
the Group.
KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023
Group Key Risk Profile
The Duopharma Biotech Group reviews and re-assesses its risks 
to determine and respond to the dynamic business environment. 
Key risk areas which are impacting its business such as 
Strategic Risk, Operational Risk, Financial Risk, Emerging Risk 
and	Project	Risk	continue	 to	be	reviewed,	 profiled,	 monitored,	
and	reported.	During	the	year,	the	risk	profile	at	the	Group	level	
continues to highlight key risk within respective key risk areas 
which	are	residually	 significant	 and	impacting	the	Group	under	
the present environment. Meanwhile, the remaining risks which 
had been reasonably managed and no longer a major threat to 
the Group such as COVID-19 related risks are only maintained 
and monitored within the risk register.  

---- Page 155 ----
153
Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control
During the year, the status of the Group’s cybersecurity 
evaluation, mitigation controls and preventive measures 
pursuant to Guideline 10.3 and Practice 13.3 of the MCCG was 
updated to the RMC and Board.
Regional Subsidiaries Risk Profile
As part of the efforts to ensure adequate risk assessment 
are being implemented across all business segments, GRMI 
together with the business unit’s risk coordinator and risk 
champion have conducted a review on the Company’s regional 
subsidiaries, namely Duopharma (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., DB 
(Philippines), Inc. and the newly established subsidiary, PT 
Duopharma Healthcare Indonesia, with the objective to re-
assess the existing risks as well as identify potential emerging 
risk.	The	risk	profiles	are	being	reported	on	quarterly	basis	to	the	
respective Group Board, RMC and the Board of the subsidiary.
Highbond - Risk Management System
GRMI continues to optimise the usage of Highbond, in managing 
the	risk	profiles	and	registers	data	across	the	Group.	Highbond	
is an enterprise governance software platform, that creates 
stronger security, risk management, compliance and assurance. 
This risk management system will allow the Group to utilise a 
single risk repository system to capture more accurate risk data, 
enhance the risk dashboard and facilitate access to live risk 
information. Available features within the systems are explored 
and implemented during the year to add value in managing the 
risk data.
Risk Awareness Sessions
During the year under review, several risk awareness sessions 
were conducted for onboarding employees, existing staff 
with vested interest, including for the project team during  
engagement	 to	develop	 a	project	 risk	profile.	 These	 sessions	
aimed to ensure that the risk processes are reasonably 
understood enabling participants to identify and assess the 
potential risks effectively. Besides familiarising participants 
with the Risk Management Manual & Guideline, they were 
also briefed on the Highbond system where the risk data is 
registered. Risk team is committed to continuously enhancing its 
approach focusing on key areas outlined in the Risk Framework. 
We will engage with respective risk owners to address any 
gaps in their understanding on the subject. Nonetheless, Risk 
team will continue to add more risk management resources 
and information to the Intranet and MyDuopharma Learning 
platform, including highlighting the development made to the 
Risk portfolios.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
Key Elements of the Group’s System of Internal Controls
(i) Oversight by the Audit Committee
 The AC is tasked with ensuring the Board’s effective 
management	 of	 financial	 reporting,	 external	 and	 internal	
audits, and investigation matters, excluding whistleblowing 
matters. The Minutes of the AC meetings are tabled to the 
Board quarterly.
 The Board is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of 
internal control, whilst Management is accountable to the 
Board for establishing an internal control framework that 
provides the Board with reasonable assurance that the 
control objectives will be achieved. The AC reviews and 
approves the annual internal audit plan, with the frequency 
of	 audits	 reflecting	 the	 level	 of	 the	 assessed	 risks.	 The	
Group Internal Audit assesses the internal control system’s 
effectiveness in managing key risks, reporting to the AC 
quarterly. It recommends improvements and conducts follow-
up audits, focusing on priority areas approved by the AC.
 The AC reviews the Internal Auditor’s scope of work, as laid 
out in the Annual Internal Audit Plan, as well as its authority 
and access as per the Internal Audit Charter – ensuring 
that	the	Internal	Auditor	has	sufficient	resources	to	function	
effectively.
 The TOR of the AC in relation to oversight by the 
audit committee is incorporated in the Board Charter, 
which is accessible on the Company’s website  
https://duopharmabiotech.com/esg/governance-and-policies.
(ii) Oversight by Board Committees
 The delegation of responsibilities to the various Board 
committees	 is	 clearly	 defined	 in	 the	 TOR	 of	 the	 Board	
Committees, which were revised during the year under 
review. The revision to the TORs was made to improve 
decision-making	efficiency	by	allowing	the	Board	to	focus	
on reserved material matters. The revision will facilitate the 
Board and the Board Committees in discharging their duties 
more	efficiently.	Further	to	the	revision	of	the	TORs,	the	
Board Charter was also reviewed to ensure it is in line with 
the revisions made to the said TORs.

---- Page 156 ----
154
We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
 At present, the committees that have been established are 
the AC, RMC, Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
(“NRC”), Halal and Sustainability Committee (“HSC”) and 
Medical and Research Committee (“MRC”).
(iii) Review of Compliance with the Malaysian Code on 
Corporate Governance 2021 (“MCCG 2021”) and the 
Recurrent Related Party Transactions (“RRPT”) for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023
 The Company’s Group Internal Auditor conducts an annual 
review of the Company’s compliance with the MCCG 2021 
and	RRPT	requirements.	The	review	for	the	financial	year	
ended 31 December 2023 was conducted in December 2023 
and the outcome was reported to the AC.
(iv) Audit Committee’s Oversight on Finance Function
 Bursa Malaysia Berhad released an updated Corporate 
Governance Guide (4 th Edition) (“CG Guide”) in December 
2021 to complement the Malaysian Code on Corporate 
Governance issued by the Securities Commission Malaysia 
in April 2021. As recommended by the Guide, the Audit 
Committee (“AC”) conducts an annual review of the Group 
Finance Department. The most recent review, conducted in 
August 2023, included checks on the background of Finance 
personnel	and	the	infrastructure	supporting	financial	reporting	
processes.	The	AC	concluded	that	the	finance	function	is	
managed	by	qualified	personnel	with	appropriate	skills	and	
resources	to	support	the	Group’s	financial	reporting.
(v) Assignment of Authority and Responsibility
 The Board has approved Limits of Authority (“LOA”), 
delineating responsibilities and authorisation levels across 
the Board, its committees, and Management. The latest LOA, 
sanctioned in November 2022, aims to tackle operational 
challenges and respond to evolving risks within Duopharma 
Biotech Group.
 In February 2022, the Board also approved changes to 
Duopharma Biotech’s mergers and acquisitions framework, 
namely the addition of an investment framework that includes 
Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) as another 
parameter when evaluating mergers and acquisitions, and 
investment proposals.
(vi) Insurance and physical safeguards
 Appropriate safeguards and adequate annual Takaful/
Insurance assessment are in place covering the Group’s 
significant	assets	and	operating	facilities	to	minimise	losses	
from any mishap including natural or environmental hazards, 
and unauthorised intrusion.
(vii) Planning, Monitoring & Reporting
 The Group undertakes a strategic budget planning process 
annually to establish plans and targets against which 
performance is monitored. This process is linked to the 
Corporate Strategy on which the Board is updated quarterly. 
This business plan and budgets are subjected to evaluation 
and assessment by the Management and the Board. The 
RMC deliberates on the risks and mitigation plans for the 
strategy and business plan before these are recommended 
to the Board for approval. Monthly reviews are carried out 
by the Management to ensure the businesses are operating 
according to the plans, as well as to monitor adherence to 
internal control procedures established. Management reports 
are	presented	to	the	Board	every	quarter	providing	financial	
information including key performance and risk indicators. 
The	financial	information	is	reviewed	by	the	Management	
before it is presented to the Board for consideration and 
approval. Key issues in 2023 included the strengthening of 
the US Dollar versus the Ringgit Malaysia and other global 
currencies, driven by regular interest rate hikes by the US 
Federal	 Reserve	 to	 combat	 inflation,	 the	 Russia-Ukraine	
and	Palestine	-Israel	conflicts,	the	slowing	down	of	China’s	
economy, Bank Negara’s OPR increase to 3% (highest since 
2019), and the changes in demand pattern for immunity-
boosting products such as Vitamin C as we exited the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple strategy reviews were done 
throughout the year to monitor the impact of these issues 
on	the	Group’s	financial	performance,	strategic	direction	and	
ongoing projects. Moving forward, Management will continue 
to monitor the situation.
 Moreover, 2023 also saw the development of a new 10 Years 
Corporate Strategy covering the period from 2024 to 2033. 
An extensive exercise that derived inputs from various levels 
within the organisation, and supplemented by engagements 
with external Key Opinion Leaders, the strategy aims to put 
Duopharma within the Top 5 among ASEAN’s pharmaceutical 
players by 2033. The Strategy was approved by the Board on 
30th November 2023.

(x) Sustainability Management
 Duopharma Biotech’s leadership focuses on sustainability as part of our ESG strategy to become a Responsible Pharmaceutical 
Company. Our aim is to shift the mindset about sustainability from mere compliance to an opportunity for business innovation 
and long-term value. We are committed to transitioning into a low-carbon economy and minimising our negative footprint while 
enhancing positive outcomes. Duopharma Biotech’s 5-Year ESG Strategy focuses on ‘Climate Performance’ and Net Zero Transition 
Plan. We have implemented strategic initiatives and established a governance structure to monitor sustainability performance 
and report progress to the Board of Directors and dedicated committees. At the operational level, the Group Sustainability 
Department is responsible for implementing sustainability initiatives. The department plays a key role in implementing the ESG 
Strategy, collaborating with all sites to monitor progress and performance. Reporting occurs weekly to the Chief Manufacturing and 
Sustainability	Officer,	monthly	to	the	GMC,	and	quarterly	to	the	HSC	and	Board.	ESG	performance	targets	are	integrated	into	KPIs	
for senior management and at the Group level. Duopharma Biotech has been included in the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Index 
for four consecutive years, continuously improving our overall rating score. Duopharma Biotech acknowledges the risks of being 
delisted from the index and has included this information in the Group’s risk register.

(xi) Human Resource Management 
 Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) are used to measure 
employees’ achievement in relation to Duopharma Biotech’s 
business and operational objectives. The Performance 
Management System utilises a top-down approach of 
cascading the Group’s performance target into individual 
KPIs to ensure consistency and alignment in assessing 
employee performance at all levels. Using the Competencies 
Framework and Learning & Development Framework, 
the skills set of the Group’s talent pool and staff are kept 
updated with various learning programmes, enhancing their 
capabilities to carry out duties and responsibilities towards 
achieving the Group’s objectives. The Group also regularly 
reviews	&	revises	our	salary	band	&	benefits	scheme	in	
order to stay competitive for talent attraction and retention 
purposes. 
 To ensure unsatisfactory performance and workplace 
conflicts	 are	 properly	 dealt	 with,	 the	 Group	 has	 in	 place	
guidelines for handling Performance Improvement Plans 
(“PIP”) and disciplinary issues. The latter include any breach 
of integrity or other forms of conduct that do not comply with 
the terms and conditions of service, whether expressed or 
implied. 
 Employee engagement is emphasised across the Group, 
where various programmes, activities and competitions are 
held with active participation from employees. At these events, 
the Group’s Core Values are reinforced and strengthened. 
Our Employee Engagement Index survey conducted from 24 
October to 6 November 2023 attracted a strong participation 
from 98.9% of the respondents and showed a result of 88% 
engaged workforce.
(xii) Group Internal Audit (“GIA”)
 The GIA reviews and assesses the adequacy, operating 
effectiveness of the system of internal control in managing 
key risks, and reports to the AC on a quarterly basis. The 
annual audit plan is reviewed and approved by the AC, with 
the	frequency	of	audits	reflecting	the	level	of	the	assessed	
risks. The audit reports provide an independent and objective 
assessment of operational and management activities in the 
related functions. Where weaknesses and/or opportunities for 
improvement	have	been	identified,	improvement	measures	
are recommended to strengthen controls, and follow-up 
audits are conducted by the GIA to monitor Management’s 
response.	Timely	resolution	of	Internal	Audit	findings	has	
been included as a performance measurement criterion for 
Heads of Department to ensure accountability. In carrying 
out its work, GIA focuses on areas of priority as directed and 
approved by the AC.
(xiii) Integrity
 Duopharma Biotech believes that integrating a high-integrity 
and anti-corruption culture into the corporate responsibility 
agenda sends a strong message that all organisations 
seeking to associate with Duopharma Biotech are responsible 
for addressing and managing their integrity and exposure to 
corruption.
 The Group has zero tolerance for any type of bribery, 
corruption or fraud, and expects its employees to maintain 
a high standard of professionalism and ethics in all business 
activities. Key strategies adopted to maintain a culture of 
integrity include awareness creation and enhancement, 
bribery and corruption prevention, punitive actions for 
misconduct and rewards for exemplary performance.
 Integrity Function
 Integrity function operates independently in Duopharma 
Biotech. Integrity function plays a pivotal role in ensuring 
the robustness and integrity of the internal control system, 
specifically	in	managing	the	critical	domain	of	Corruption	
Risk within the Corruption Risk Management framework. The 
dedicated team of Integrity function meticulously reviews 
and assesses the adequacy and operating effectiveness of 
the internal control mechanisms in maintaining the highest 
standards of integrity of the Group.
 In the execution of its responsibilities, GRMI maintains 
a sharp focus on areas prioritised and approved by the 
RMC. This strategic alignment ensures that efforts are 
channeled towards the most critical aspects, contributing to 
a comprehensive and effective risk management framework 
within Duopharma.
 Among the key Integrity activities carried out during the year 
are as follows:
(a) ISO37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System
 The Integrity function is responsible for, amongst others, 
ensuring compliance with the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery 
Management System (“ABMS”), conducting programmes 
to inculcate and enhance integrity in the Group’s culture 
and its stakeholders, managing the Group’s Whistleblowing 
channels (“SpeakUpPharma”), enhancing business practices 
to further improve governance, and verifying information/
complaints received via the whistleblowing channels. The 
Integrity function also provides independent advice to staff 
and promotes ethical awareness through outreach and 
training.
Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control

---- Page 160 ----
158
We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
 On a quarterly basis, GRMI diligently reports the integrity 
functional status and insights to the RMC, keeping them 
apprised of the current situation in relation to corruption 
risk. A crucial component of their responsibilities for the year 
involves the scrutiny and approval of the ISO 37001:2016 
ABMS	Recertification	audit	conducted	by	a	certification	body,	
SIRIM QAS International Sdn. Bhd. (“SIRIM”). Prior to the 
scheduled external audits, internal compliance audits are 
routinely performed by the Anti-Bribery Management System 
Committee,	 designed	 to	 reflect	 the	 preparedness	 of	 all	
business units in complying to the applicable anti-corruption 
laws and Group policies and procedures.
 The Group, including its overseas subsidiaries in the 
Philippines and Singapore, obtained the ISO 37001:2016 
ABMS	 certification	 without	 a	 single	 Non-Conformance	
Report issued by SIRIM in September 2023. However, six 
Opportunities	 for	 Improvement	 findings	 were	 noted.	 This	
is a testament to the continuous effectiveness of initiatives 
embedding ethics and integrity in the Group’s culture and the 
commitment to adequately address bribery/corruption risks 
while establishing a track record of accountability in order to 
create a better workplace and business environment.
(b) Duopharma Biotech Organisational Integrity and Anti-
Corruption Plan (“OIACP”) 2021 – 2023
 The Board approved the Duopharma Biotech OIACP 2021 
– 2023 to reinforce its commitment to ethical operations. 
The	Plan	serves	to	foster	and	maintain	the	confidence	of	
the Board, Management, employees and stakeholders in 
the Company’s Integrity and Anti-Corruption System. This 
is achieved through the provision of a framework to build 
a culture of integrity in Duopharma Biotech via strategies 
and programmes guided by the Malaysian National Anti-
Corruption Plan, Guidelines on Adequate Procedures, and 
ABMS. The details can be referred to in the Sustainability 
Report.
 In 2023, Duopharma Biotech embarked on 31 initiatives, 
including web-based training on Duopharma Biotech Anti-
Bribery and Anti-Corruption; implementation of Human 
Governance	Profiling	(“HGP”)	on	a	pilot	trial	for	proof-of-
concept (“POC”); and formulation of an integrity and anti-
corruption module for external business associates, among 
others.	Integrity	office	shall	conclude	the	OIACP	for	2021-
2023 soon, marking the completion of its 3 years cycle plan. 
As at December 2023, the progress of the OIACP stands at 
93% completion, pending additional effort to nurture business 
associates on various anti-corruption subjects via series of 
training programmes module. Additionally, OIACP 2024 has 
been prepared and will be presented for RMC’s endorsement 
and Board’s approval in 1st quarter of 2024.
(c) Corruption Risk Management (“CRM”)
 Duopharma Biotech’s Corruption Risk Management echoes 
the tone at the top and sets appropriate standards in 
managing risks arising from fraud, bribery and corruption.
 During the year, separate corruption risk assessments were 
conducted at our subsidiaries in the Philippines, Singapore 
and	 Indonesia,	 reflecting	 key	 provisions	 of	 Singapore’s	
Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 and the Philippines 
Republic Act, Act and the Corruption Eradication Indonesia 
Law respectively. The CRM conforms to the requirement of 
MS2764 CRM.
 A corruption/bribery risk assessment of Duopharma Biotech 
Group has been undertaken and used to improve the ABMS. 
The Corruption Risk Report is tabled annually at the Risk 
Management Committee Meeting and quarterly if there are 
any changes or updates to the report. The meetings are 
attended by the relevant corruption/bribery risk owners.
 The assessment, which is under the purview of the Integrity 
Office,	is	included	in	the	Group’s	annual	risk	assessment	
pursuant to Paragraph 15.29(1) of the Main Market Listing 
Requirements.
(d) Code of Conduct
 Duopharma Biotech’s Code of Conduct is enshrined in six 
fundamental ethical values: Passion, Excellence, Teamwork, 
Integrity, Responsible and Respect, or PETIRR. The 
Company and all employees are expected to adhere to these 
values, both in letter and in spirit.
	 The	 Code	 of	 Conduct	 includes	 policies	 on	 Conflict	 of	
Interest, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption, Gift, Hospitality 
and Entertainment, Competition Law, Securities and Insider 
Trading, Risk Management, Information Communication 
Technology, Intellectual Property and Innovation, Quality and 
Halal policies.
 A Bahasa Malaysia version of the Code of Conduct was 
made available to ensure universal understanding by all 
employees.
(e) Establishment of Key Policies in Relation to Ethics, 
Integrity and Anti-Corruption
 To achieve the highest standards of ethical conduct and 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations, steps were 
taken to strengthen the state of governance and integrity 
in Duopharma Biotech. During the year, several Integrity 
Policies	 and	 Procedure	 have	 been	 revised	 to	 reflect	 the	
Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control

---- Page 161 ----

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
current practices. Subsequently, the Board of Duopharma 
Biotech has approved those Integrity policies and procedure 
in accordance with ABMS requirements.
 The policies and procedure have been uploaded onto 
the intranet and Duopharma Biotech website for ease of 
reference in both, Bahasa Malaysia and English versions. 
Briefing	sessions	and	refreshers	have	been	conducted	for	
employees at all sites, in addition to the use of reminder 
cards, buntings, posters, computer screen savers and 
communication through the Integrity Champions. The 
Business Ethics Policy and the ABMS Policy are displayed at 
all sites.
(f) Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure
 The Group’s Whistle-Blowing Policy, available in English and 
Bahasa	Malaysia,	was	first	approved	by	the	Board	in	2018.	
Since	then,	refresher	briefings	have	been	conducted	for	all	
staff including in 2023.
 Pursuant to the issuance of the ISO 37002:2021 
Whistleblowing Management System – Guidelines by the 
International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) in July 
2021, the Head of GRMI has reviewed Duopharma Biotech’s 
Whistleblowing Policy. A revised Whistleblowing Policy 
conforming with the new guidelines was approved by the 
Board on 8 November 2023.
 Whistleblowing provides an avenue for employees and 
stakeholders to report any concerns regarding unlawful 
conduct,	 financial	 fraud,	 malpractice	 or	 an	 unethical	 act.	
There	 are	 currently	 five	 Speak-Up-Pharma	 channels	 to	
address their concerns, namely via written mail, email, 
telephone, short messaging services, and a secured website.
 The Policy also provides assurance that the whistleblower 
will be protected from possible reprisal or victimisation if they 
have a reasonable belief that they have made their disclosure 
in good faith. Reports made via Speak-Up-Pharma and all 
associated	investigatory	records	will	remain	confidential.
 The Whistleblowing Investigation Procedure was revised 
and endorsed by the RMC on 7 November 2023 and 
subsequently approved by the Board on 8 November 2023. 
These ensure the investigation activities are conducted 
thoroughly, objectively and effectively, in accordance with 
the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, 
Whistleblower Protection Act 2010, Penal Code and other 
best practices.
 In 2023, four reports were received via the whistleblowing 
channel, all of which were discussed and subsequently 
closed by the RMC. The number of whistleblowing reports 
received and their status is reported to the Malaysian Anti-
Corruption Commission on a bi-annual basis.
(g) Mandatory Ethics & Integrity Policies Briefing
 The initial training on Ethics, Integrity and Anti-Corruption 
was rolled out to all employees in 2015. Since then, periodical 
programmes, weekly reminders and ethics news have been 
initiated to share updates with employees.
 Following amendments to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission Act 2009 (Act 694) to include Section 17A 
(Act A1567) on Corporate Liability effective 1 June 2020, a 
Mandatory	Ethics	&	Integrity	Policies	briefing	was	conducted	
for	all	employees	followed	by	a	refresher	briefing	in	2023.	
The	 Integrity	 Champions	 also	 delivered	 briefings	 to	 our	
colleagues in the production line. Training for overseas 
operations was carried out through a combination of in-
person and video conferencing.
(h) New Staff Induction on Ethics, Integrity & Anti-
Corruption
 Since 1 July 2022, it is compulsory for all new Duopharma 
Biotech employees to go through the online module on 
Ethics, Integrity and Anti-Corruption via the My Duopharma 
Learning	platform.	Previously,	the	Integrity	Office	provided	
in-person and virtual training to new employees in Malaysia.
(i) Integrity Pact
 The Integrity Pact (“IP”) was developed by Transparency 
International (“TI”) in the 1990s to assist the government, 
business institutions and the public to curb corruption. The 
main objective is to commit vendors and suppliers to ethical 
behaviour and to create a business environment that is free 
from corruption in tandem with the Anti-Corruption Principles 
for Corporations.
 By signing the IP, the Group and its suppliers agree to 
uphold Anti-Corruption Principles in the conduct of business 
and interactions while working towards creating a business 
environment that is free from corruption.
(j) Integrity and Anti-Corruption Programme for Business 
Associates
 Under Duopharma Biotech’s OIACP, there are plans to 
implement an Integrity & Anti-Corruption programme for 
external business associates. As a pilot project, agents were 
Statement on Risk Management
and Internal Control

We Are Duopharma Biotech From The Leadership Our Strategic ReviewDUOPHARMA BIOTECH BERHAD
enrolled in the programme, which is guided by requirements 
of the MACC Act 2009 and comprised of 14 modules that are 
expected to be completed by quarter 1, 2024. The inaugural 
series kicked off in January 2023. Prior to that, in December 
2022, an inaugural batch of 27 agents participating in the 
Integrity & Anti-Corruption programme had pledged to 
integrity, ethics and anti-corruption by signing the Ikrar Bebas 
Rasuah (“IBR”).
 The Duopharma Biotech Integrity and Anti-Corruption 
Series for Business Associates assists business associates 
in identifying gaps, assess the corruption and ethical risks 
faced, and implement the required control measures to 
overcome	identified	corruption	risks.
 Duopharma Biotech believes that integrating a high-integrity 
and anti-corruption culture into the corporate responsibility 
agenda sends a strong message that all organisations 
seeking to associate themselves with Duopharma Biotech 
are responsible for addressing and managing their integrity 
and anti-corruption exposure. Other than the Integrity Pact, 
desktop due diligence (“KYC”) is conducted on each party 
that is to be associated with Duopharma Biotech.
(k) Declaration of Interest Filing
 The Group’s integrity, ethics and anti-corruption policies 
provide minimum enforceable guidelines to facilitate handling 
conflicts	of	interest	and	situations	that	would	jeopardise	the	
integrity of the individual and the organisation.
	 The	 Integrity	 Officer	 continues	 to	 oversee	 the	 annual	
process	of	filing	the	Declaration	of	Interest	Forms,	and	the	
annual circulation of the Declaration of Interest Policy to all 
employees. The details can be referred to in the Sustainability 
Report.
(l) Appointment of Integrity Champions
 The Integrity Champions comprise employees respected 
for their professional qualities and their exemplary personal 
conduct. The details can be referred to the Sustainability 
Report.
BOARD ASSESSMENT
The Board is of the view that the Company’s overall risk 
management and internal control system is operating adequately 
and effectively in all material aspects. The Board has additionally 
received assurance of the same from both the Group Managing 
Director	and	Chief	Financial	Officer	of	the	Company.
The	 Board	 confirms	 that	 the	 risk	 management	 processes	 for	
identifying,	 evaluating	 and	 managing	 significant	 risks	 faced	 by	
the Group have been in place throughout 2023 up to the date of 
approval of this statement.
For	the	financial	year	2023,	the	Board	is	of	the	view	that	the	
system of internal controls was adequate and effective, and has 
not resulted in any material loss, contingency or uncertainty that 
would require disclosure in the Integrated Annual Report 2023.
REVIEW OF STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control pursuant to the scope set out 
in the Audit and Assurance Practice Guide (“AAPG”) 3, Guidance 
for Auditors on Engagements to Report on the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control included in the Annual Report 
issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“MIA”). They 
have subsequently reported to the Board that nothing, in all material 
respects, has come to their attention causing them to believe that 
the statement intended to be included in the annual report of the 
Group for the year ended 31 December 2023:
(a) has not been prepared in accordance with the disclosures 
required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors 
of Listed Issuers, or
(b) is factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether 
the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control 
covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control system including the assessment and opinion by the Board 
of Directors and Management thereon. The auditors are also not 
required to consider whether the processes described to deal 
with	material	internal	control	aspects	of	any	significant	problems	
disclosed in the annual report will, in fact, remedy the problems.
The statement has been approved by the Board of Directors at its 
meeting on 19 March 2024.

5. RECURRENT RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION OF 
REVENUE OR TRADING NATURE
 Duopharma Biotech has not sought any shareholders’ 
mandate for the recurrent related party transaction of 
a revenue or trading nature at the last Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company held on 31 May 2023.  
The last shareholders’ mandate for the recurrent related party 
transaction of a revenue or trading nature which is necessary 
for its day-to-day operations and is in the ordinary course of 
business with related parties was obtained during the AGM 
held on 22 May 2017 and the said mandate had expired upon 
conclusion of the AGM held on 31 May 2018.
 By letter dated 23 May 2018, Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad had approved the Company’s application for waiver 
from having to comply with Paragraph 10.09 of the MMLR 
in respect of any future recurrent related party transactions 
(“RRPTs”) between the Duopharma Biotech group of 
companies and any companies in which Permodalan Nasional 
Berhad (“PNB”) and/or the unit trust funds managed by PNB 
are interested in as substantial shareholders (“PNB Investee 
Companies”). The approval was subject to the condition that 
all such RRPTs are based on terms not more favourable to 
PNB and/or PNB Investee Companies than those generally 
available to the public and are not detrimental to the minority 
shareholders of the Company. In view of the aforesaid waiver 
and since no other RRPTs of a revenue or trading nature 
(i.e., other than those falling within the ambit of the aforesaid 
waiver, or those transactions that fall within the relevant 
thresholds prescribed by the MMLR, or those transactions 
that are not normally regarded as related party transactions 
under Paragraph 10.08(11) of the MMLR) have as at  
29	March	2024	been	identified	or	anticipated	for	the	period	
from the date of the forthcoming AGM of the Company 
until the date of the next AGM of the Company in 2025, the 
Company will not be seeking a new shareholders’ mandate 
to apply to RRPTs of a revenue or trading nature with related 
parties at the forthcoming AGM of the Company.
 In view of the aforesaid, there was no requirement for 
shareholders to mandate RRPTs of a revenue or trading 
nature with related parties during the year under review. 
Consequently, there were no RRPTs conducted pursuant to 
a	shareholders’	mandate	for	RRPTs	during	the	financial	year	
ended 31 December 2023, and no requirement to disclose in 
this Integrated Annual Report on RRPTs conducted pursuant 
to	a	shareholders’	mandate	for	RRPTs	during	the	financial	
year ended 31 December 2023.
 The Board of Directors had in 2022, at the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee (“AC”), approved the adoption of the 
Related Party Transaction Framework for the Group which 
outlined the procedures for identifying, monitoring, evaluating, 

---- Page 167 ----

Other Disclosures
reporting and approving related party transactions (“RPT”) 
and recurrent related party transactions (“RRPT”) to ensure 
that such transactions are conducted on arm’s length basis 
and in accordance with the MMLR and applicable laws. The 
Related Party Transaction Framework is intended to assist 
the Board and the AC in discharging their roles, which are to 
provide oversight over RPT and RRPT within the Group; and 
also ensure similar understanding and provide consistency 
of actions within the Group in identifying, monitoring, 
evaluating, reporting and approving RPT and RRPT to 
ensure compliance with the MMLR and applicable laws.
 All related party transactions are examined quarterly by 
the AC and audited annually by the Group Internal Audit 
Department. The AC and the Board have assessed the 
Group’s RRPTs of a revenue or trading nature and have 
prescribed the following processes to be adhered to by the 
Duopharma Biotech Group:-
(i) the RRPTs are to be undertaken on an arm’s length 
basis and on normal commercial terms consistent 
with Duopharma Biotech Group’s usual business 
practices and policies, which are no more favourable 
to the interested parties than those generally available 
to the public and are not detrimental to the minority 
shareholders of Duopharma; 
(ii) the RRPTs involving the interest of related parties will 
only be transacted at the prevailing market rates/prices 
for the services or products on the usual commercial 
terms, or otherwise in accordance with applicable 
industry norms, after taking into account the pricing, the 
level of services, quality of products and other related 
factors; and 
(iii) the pricing for services and products to be provided/ 
supplied and/or received is determined based on the 
Duopharma Biotech Group’s business practices and 
policies to ensure that prices and terms and conditions 
are based on competitive prices of similar products and 
services in the open market.

OPTIONS GRANTED OVER UNISSUED SHARES 
No options were granted to any person to take up unissued shares of the Company during the financial year.
INDEMNITY AND INSURANCE COSTS 
During the financial year, Directors and Officers of Duopharma Biotech Berhad, together with its subsidiaries are covered under the 
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance in respect of liabilities arising from acts committed in their respective capacity as, inter 
alia, Directors and Officers of the Group subject to the terms of the policy. 
The total amount of Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance effected for the Directors and Officers of the Group was RM50 million. 
The total amount of premium paid by the Group for the Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance was RM60,107.
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain 
that:
i) all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts, and
ii) any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business have been written down to an amount 
which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
i) that would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts in the Group and in 
the Company inadequate to any substantial extent, or 
ii) that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
misleading, or
iii) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the 
Company misleading or inappropriate, or
iv) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements that would render any amount stated in the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company misleading.
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
i) any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year and which secures 
the liabilities of any other person, or
ii) any contingent liability in respect of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year.
No contingent liability or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable 
within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially 
affect the ability of the Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors, the financial performance of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 
2023 have not been substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature nor has any such item, 
transaction or event occurred in the interval between the end of that financial year and the date of this report.

beginning on or after 1 January 2024.
• from the annual period beginning on 1 January 2025 for the amendments that are effective for annual periods

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
(d) Use of estimates and judgements (continued)
 There are no significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than those disclosed in the following notes:
• Note 6 – Investments in subsidiaries
• Note 8 – Recoverable amount of deferred tax assets
• Note 10 – Net realisable value of inventories
• Note 15 – Revenue

2.1 Material accounting policy information
 The Group has adopted amendments to MFRS 101, Presentation of Financial Statements and MFRS Practice Statement 
2 – Disclosures of Accounting Policies from 1 January 2023. The amendments require the disclosure of ‘material’, 
rather than ‘significant’, accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to 
disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-specific accounting policy information that 
users need to understand other information in the financial statements.
 Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the Group’s accounting policies, it impacted the accounting 
policy information disclosed in the financial statements. The material accounting policy information is disclosed in the 
respective notes to the financial statements where relevant.
2.2 Global minimum top-up tax

accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure 
(see Note 8). The temporary mandatory relief applies retrospectively.

Note 3.4
3.1 Change in estimates
 During the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Group conducted an operational efficiency review at its plants, 
which resulted in changes in the expected usage of certain items of plant and machinery. 
 Certain plant and machinery, which management previously expected to utilise in production for 10 years, are now 
expected to remain in production for a period of 20 years from the date of purchase.  As a result, the expected useful 
lives of these assets increased. The effect of these changes on depreciation expense have been recognised in cost of 
sales and are immaterial in current and for future periods.

3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)
3.2 Reclassification from/(to) intangible assets
 During the financial year, the Group has reclassified RM11,540,000 (2022: Nil) cost to building production plant from 
intangible assets (development costs) to reflect its nature. 
 The Group and the Company have reclassified two computer software amounting to cost RM3,686,000 (2022: Nil) to 
intangible assets to reflect its nature.
3.3 Material accounting policy information
(a) Recognition and measurement
 Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses.
 Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that 
equipment.
 When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted 
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. 
 The gain and loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds 
from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and is recognised net within “other income” 
and “other expenses” respectively in profit or loss.
(b) Depreciation
 Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component 
of an item of property, plant and equipment from the date that they are available for use. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. Property, plant and equipment under construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for 
their intended use. 
 The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
2023 2022
• freehold buildings 50 years 50 years
• plant and machineries 5 - 20 years 5 - 10 years
• office equipment, furniture and fittings 5 - 20 years 5 - 20 years
• motor vehicles 4 -10 years 4 -10 years
• renovations 10 years 10 years
 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of the reporting period and adjusted 
as appropriate.

 The Group and the Company lease buildings and land under operating lease. The lease typically run for a period of 3 
years.
3.4.1 Judgements and assumptions in relation to leases
 The Group assesses at lease commencement date by applying judgement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise 
the extension options. Group entities consider all facts and circumstances including their past practice and any cost that 
will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help them determine the lease term.
 The Group also applied judgement and assumptions in determining the incremental borrowing rate of the lease. Group 
entities first determine the closest available borrowing rates before using judgement to determine the adjustments 
required to reflect the term, security, value or economic environment of the lease.
3.4.2 Material accounting policy information
(a) Recognition and measurement
 All right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.

(b) Lease and non-lease components
 At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration 
in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, 
for leases of properties in which the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate non-lease components and 
will instead account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
(c) Recognition exemption
 The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have 
a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments 
associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. 
It assesses the lease classification of a sublease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head 
lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies 
the exemption described above, then it classifies the sublease as an operating lease.

4. INVESTMENT PROPERTY (CONTINUED)
4.1 Fair value information (continued)
 The following table shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values within Level 3, as well as the 
significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models.
Description of valuation technique 
and inputs used Significant unobservable inputs
Inter-relationship between 
significant unobservable inputs 
and fair value measurement
Sales comparison approach: 
Sales price of comparable land 
and buildings in close proximity 
are adjusted for differences in key 
attributes such as property size. 
The most significant input into this 
valuation approach is price per 
square foot.
Recent transactions of similar 
properties at or near reporting date 
with similar land usage, land size and 
location. 
The characteristics, merits and 
disadvantages of these properties 
are noted and diligent adjustments 
thereof are then made by valuer to 
reflect the differences and to arrive at 
the value of the property.
The estimated fair value would 
increase (decrease) if recent 
transactions of similar properties at or 
near reporting date with similar land 
usage, land size and location were 
higher (lower).
 Valuation processes applied by the Group for Level 3 fair value
 The fair value of investment property is determined by external, independent property valuer, having appropriate 
recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued. The 
valuation company provides the fair value of the Group’s investment property portfolio every twelve months. Changes 
in Level 3 fair values are analysed by the management every twelve months after obtaining valuation report from the 
valuation company.  
 Highest and best use
 The Group’s investment property is a vacant land. The highest and best use of the property should be an industrial land 
located nearby the Group’s investment property.
4.2 Material accounting policy information
 Investment properties are measured subsequently at fair value with any changes therein recognised in profit or loss for 
the period in which they arise.

8.4 Material accounting policy information
 Where investment properties are carried at their fair value, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured using 
the tax rates that would apply on sale of those assets at their carrying values at the reporting date unless the property is 
depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the property 
over time, rather than through sale. In all other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

24.3 Financial risk management
 The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk
24.4 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from its receivables from customers. 
The Company’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries. 
 Trade receivables
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit 
evaluations are performed on new customers who require credit facility during the financial year. Depending on the 
nature of the transactions and the customer’s risk profile, the Group may require upfront deposits as collateral. 
 At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether any of the trade receivables are credit impaired.

24. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
24.4 Credit risk (continued)
 Trade receivables (continued)
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk (continued)
 The gross carrying amounts of credit impaired trade receivables are written off (either partially or fully) when there is 
no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. 
Nevertheless, trade receivables that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities.
There are no significant changes as compared to previous year.
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables is represented 
by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position. 
 Management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are stated at 
their realisable values. A significant portion of these receivables are regular customers that have been transacting with 
the Group. The Group uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of the receivables.

 Recognition and measurement of impairment losses
 In managing credit risk of trade receivables, the Group manages its debtors and takes appropriate actions (including but 
not limited to legal actions) to recover long overdue balances. Generally, trade receivables will pay within 90 days. 
 The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure ECLs of trade receivables. Invoices which are past due 90 days will be 
considered as credit impaired.
 Loss rates are calculated using a ‘roll rate’ method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through 
successive stages of delinquency to 90 days past due.
 Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past three years. The Group also considers differences 
between (a) economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, (b) current conditions 
and (c) the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. Nevertheless, the Group 
believes that these factors are immaterial for the purpose of impairment calculation for the year.
 The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables as at 31 
December 2023.

24.4 Credit risk (continued)
 Cash and cash equivalents and deposits with licensed banks
 The cash and cash equivalents and deposits are held with banks and financial institutions. As at the end of the reporting 
period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial 
position.
 These banks and financial institutions have low credit risks. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view 
that the loss allowance is not material and hence, it is not provided for.
 Other receivables
 Credit risks on other receivables are mainly arising from deposits paid for office buildings and fixtures rented. These 
deposits will be received at the end of each lease terms. The Group manages the credit risk together with the leasing 
arrangement.
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in 
the statement of financial position.
 As at the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material 
and hence, it is not provided for. 
 Inter-company loans and advances
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the results of the 
subsidiaries regularly.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by its carrying amount in the 
statement of financial position.
 Loans and advances are only provided to subsidiaries which are wholly owned by the Company.

24.4 Credit risk (continued)
 Inter-company loans and advances (continued)
 Recognition and measurement of impairment losses
 Generally, the Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries have low credit risk. The Company assumes 
that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary’s financial position deteriorates significantly. As the 
Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the subsidiaries’ loans and advances when they are payable, the 
Company considers the loans and advances to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to pay when demanded. 
The Company considers a subsidiary’s loan or advance to be credit impaired when:
• The subsidiary is unlikely to repay its loan or advance to the Company in full; or
• The subsidiary is continuously loss making and is having a deficit shareholders’ fund.  
 As at the end of the reporting period, there was no indication that the loans and advances to the subsidiaries are not 
recoverable. The Company does not specifically monitor the ageing of the advances to the subsidiaries. 
24.5 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings.
 The Group maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank facilities deemed adequate by the management to 
ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.
 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly 
different amounts.

24.6 Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other prices that 
will affect the Group’s financial position or cash flows.
24.6.1 Currency risk
 The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and bank balance that are denominated in a 
currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk 
are primarily U.S. Dollar (“USD”), Euro (“EUR”), Singapore Dollar (“SGD”), Korean Won (“KRW”), Philippines 
Peso (“PESO”), British Pound Sterling (“GBP”), Brunei Dollar (“BND”) and Indonesian Rupiah (“IDR”).
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group ensures that the net exposure on foreign currency risk arising from commercial transactions is kept 
to an acceptable level by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-
term imbalances. 
 Exposure to foreign currency risk
 The Group’s exposure to foreign currency (a currency which is other than the functional currency of the Group 
entities) risk, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

 A 10% (2022: 10%) strengthening of the Ringgit Malaysia against the following currencies at the end of the 
reporting period would have increased/(decreased) post-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This 
analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably 
possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest 
rates, remained constant and ignores any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

24.6 Market risk (continued)
24.6.2 Interest rate risk 
 The Group’s and the Company’s investments in debt securities and borrowings are exposed to a risk of change 
in their fair value due to changes in market rates. Investments in equity securities and short-term receivables 
and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market rates relates primarily to the highly 
liquid investments with floating net asset value and its floating interest rate unsecured term loans. Changes in 
the net asset value and interest rate may expose the Group to a risk of change in cash flows.
 The excess fund placed with licensed banks and other financial institutions and corporations are for certain 
periods during which the interest rates are fixed. The management reviews the interest rates at regular intervals.

 Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
 Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
 The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge 
accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would not affect profit 
or loss.
 Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
 A change of 100 basis points (“bp”) in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would have increased/
(decreased) post-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, 
in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

 The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances, deposits with licensed banks, short term receivables and payables 
and short term borrowings reasonably approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these 
financial instruments.

financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.

 The inputs to any subsequent valuations are based on a combination of observable evidence from external transactions 
in the investee’s equity and adjusted net asset method.
 There would be no material effect on the amounts stated from any reasonably possible change in such inputs at 31 
December 2023.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the Members of Duopharma Biotech Berhad
(Registration No. 200001021664 (524271-W)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Duopharma Biotech Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as 
at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, 
statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes 
to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 174 to 236. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (“IFRS Accounting Standards”) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and 
Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence) Standards (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
To the Members of Duopharma Biotech Berhad
(Registration No. 200001021664 (524271-W)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Inventory provisions
Refer to Note 10 – Inventories.
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products 
which carry shelf life, increasing the level of judgement involved 
in estimating inventory provisions. Judgement is required to 
assess the appropriate level of provisioning for short-dated 
pharmaceutical products. Such judgements include Directors’ 
expectations for future sales and inventory liquidation plans. 
We performed the following audit procedures, among others:
• Attended inventory counts to identify whether any inventory 
was obsolete; 
• Assessed the basis for the inventory provisions, the 
consistency of provisioning in line with policy and the rationale 
for the recording of specific provisions; 
• Tested the accuracy of the ageing of inventories based on 
system generated reports;
• Tested the provision calculations and determined that 
they appropriately took into account the ageing profile of 
inventories; and
• Assessed the appropriateness of management’s inventory 
measurement under MFRS 102.
We have determined that there are no key audit matters in the audit of the separate financial statements of the Company to 
communicate in our auditors’ report.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Director’s Report and Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (but does not include the financial statements of 
the Group and of the Company and our auditors report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the 
remaining parts of the annual report, which are expected to be made available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and 
will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ 
report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard. 
When we read the remaining parts of the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to the Directors of the Company and take appropriate actions in accordance with approved standards 
on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give 
a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved 
standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Group and of 
the Company. 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as 
a going concern.

Our Performance Review Our Governance Financial Report Other Information Integrated Annual Report 2023
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our auditors’ report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not 
acted as auditors are disclosed in Note 6 to the financial statements.
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

Section 340(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2016 and Article 
57 of the Company’s Constitution for discussion only under 
Agenda 1. They do not require shareholders’ approval and

2. Ordinary Resolutions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 – Approval for the 
re-election of the Directors who retire in accordance 
with Articles 100 and 106 of the Company’s Constitution
 Article 100 of the Company’s Constitution provides that at 
each	AGM	of	the	Company,	one-third	(1/3)	of	the	Directors	for	
the time being, or if their number is not a multiple of three (3), 
the	number	nearest	to	one-third	(1/3),	shall	retire	from	office	
at the conclusion of the meeting and that each Director so 
retiring	from	office	shall	be	eligible	for	re-election.	Pursuant	
thereto, three (3) Directors will be retiring in accordance with 
Article 100 of the Constitution.
 Subsequent to the 22nd AGM of the Company that was held 
on 31 May 2023, Datin Paduka Kartini Binti Hj Abdul Manaf 
(“Datin Paduka Kartini”) was appointed as Independent  
Non-Executive Director of the Company on 1 June 2023 and 
Encik Mohd Haris Bin Mohd Arshad (“Encik Mohd Haris”) was 
appointed as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of 
the Company on 20 March 2024. Both Datin Paduka Kartini 
and Encik Mohd Haris will retire pursuant to Article 106 of the 
Constitution. Article 106 of the Constitution provides that any 
Director	appointed	to	fill	a	casual	vacancy	or	as	an	additional	
Director	shall	hold	office	only	until	the	next	AGM	and	shall	
then be eligible for re-election, but shall not be taken into 
account in determining the number of Directors who are to 
retire by rotation at such meeting.
 For the purpose of determining the eligibility of the Directors 
to stand for re-election at the 23 rd AGM, the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) had assessed each of 
the retiring Directors, and considered, among others, the 
following:-
(a)	 the	assessment	of	fit	and	proper	criteria	pursuant	to	
the Company’s Fit and Proper Policy for the Board 
of Directors and Senior Management (“Fit & Proper 
Policy”) performed via diligence or screening using 
established search databases or services as adopted 
by the Company as well as declarations from the 
concerned individuals;
(b) the Director’s performance and contribution based 
on the Self and Peer Assessment results of the 
Board	 Effectiveness	 Evaluation	 for	 financial	 year	
ended 31 December 2023 (“BEE 2023”) (including 
the assessment of independence by the Independent 
Directors seeking re-election);
(c) the Company’s Diversity Policy for the Board of 
Directors and Senior Management; and
(d) the policy on maximum tenure of Non-Executive 
Directors being limited to maximum of nine (9) years as 
set out in the Company’s Board Charter.
 Based on the said assessment, the NRC had recommended 
that	 the	 five	 (5)	 Directors	 who	 retire	 in	 accordance	 with	
Articles 100 and 106 of the Company’s Constitution were 
eligible to stand for re-election. The Board had approved the 
NRC’s assessment and recommendation that Dato’ Eisah 
Binti A. Rahman (“Dato’ Eisah”), Datuk Nik Moustpha Bin 
Haji Nik Hassan (“Datuk Nik Moustpha”), Datuk Mohd Radzif 
Bin Mohd Yunus, Datin Paduka Kartini and Encik Mohd Haris 
who retire in accordance with Articles 100 and 106 of the 
Company’s Constitution, are eligible to stand for re-election. 
Among the reasons for the Board’s recommendation for re-
election of the aforesaid Directors are as follows:-

Notice of the 23 rd Annual General Meeting
of Duopharma Biotech Berhad 
[Registration No. 200001021664 (524271-W)] (Incorporated in Malaysia)
(a) the recommendation for re-election were based on 
objective criteria and merit, namely the said Directors 
have	met	the	following	fit	and	proper	criteria	under	the	
Fit & Proper Policy:-
(i) character and integrity (encompassing the 
qualities of probity, personal integrity, financial 
integrity and reputation);
(ii) experience and competence (encompassing 
qualifications, training and skills; and relevant 
past performance or track record); and
(iii) time and commitment (encompassing 
ability to discharge role having regard to 
other commitments, and participation and 
contribution in the Board);
(b) the overall high score recorded in the Self and Peer 
Assessment under the BEE 2023 for each of the 
Directors seeking re-election (other than Datin Paduka 
Kartini who was excluded from the BEE 2023 as she 
had only been appointed about three (3) months prior 
to the BEE 2023, and Encik Mohd Haris who was 
appointed after the BEE 2023 had been completed) 
showed that they had performed well in terms of their 
respective contribution and performance as well as in 
terms of their calibre and personality;
(c) Datin Paduka Kartini and Encik Mohd Haris were 
assessed by the NRC and the Board in accordance 
with	the	aforesaid	fit	and	proper	criteria	under	the	Fit	&	
Proper Policy;
(d) the BEE 2023 highlighted strong recognition of 
diversity at the Board level and that the variety of skill 
set present amongst the current Directors allows them 
to tackle issues in a multifaceted manner; 
(e) based on the Independent Directors’ self-assessment 
under the BEE 2023, Dato’ Eisah, Datuk Nik Moustpha 
and Datin Paduka Kartini respectively had declared 
their independence; and
(f) the tenure of service of each of them calculated until 
the date of the 23rd AGM does not exceed a cumulative 
term of nine (9) years in a consecutive service nor 
cumulative service of nine (9) years with interval as 
prescribed in the Company’s Board Charter.
 All these retiring Directors had abstained from deliberations 
and decisions on their own eligibility to stand for re-election 
at the relevant NRC and Board meetings.
 The details of the five (5) Directors seeking re-election 
are set out in their respective profiles which appear in the 
Directors’ Profiles on pages 82 to 95 of the Company’s 
Integrated Annual Report 2023. The details of their interest 
in the securities of the Company are set out in their 
respective profiles as well as the Analysis of Shareholdings 
on pages 244 to 245 of the Company’s Integrated Annual 
Report 2023. 
 Any of the Directors that is seeking re-election and who is 
a shareholder of the Company will abstain from voting on 
the	resolution	in	respect	of	his/her	re-election.
 Datuk Nik Moustpha [inclusive of his cumulative tenure 
as a director in Duopharma Biotech’s former holding 
company (i.e. Chemical Company of Malaysia Berhad 
(“CCMB”)) prior to the demerger of Duopharma Biotech

auditors to uphold audit quality and manage risks, as 
set out in KPMG PLT’s Audit Transparency Report.
