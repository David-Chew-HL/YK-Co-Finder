Velesto Energy Berhad 
(“Velesto” or the 
“Group”) presents 
its Integrated Annual 
Report 2023 (“IAR 
2023”) for financial 
year ended 31

Principles and Eight 
Content Elements 
of the Integrated 
Reporting Framework 
as prescribed by the 
International Financial 
Reporting Standard 
(“IFRS”)1 .
ABOUT 
THIS REPORT
1 Since August 2022, the Value Reporting Foundation 
("VRF") has merged with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRS’) Board with the 
Integrated Reporting Framework now becoming 
a pivotal part of the effort to link sustainability 
disclosures with financial statements as prescribed 
by IFRS S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of 
Sustainability-related Financial Disclosure) standard.
SIX CAPITALS
Financial Manufactured
Intellectual Human
Social Natural
SEVEN GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Strategic focus and future orientation Connectivity of information
Conciseness Reliability and completeness
Consistency and comparability Materiality
Stakeholder relationships
EIGHT CONTENT ELEMENTS
Organisational overview and external 
environment Governance
Business model Risks and opportunities
Strategy and resource allocation Performance
Outlook Basis of preparation and presentation
The purpose of Integrated Reporting is to transcend past performance based financial reporting, 
which provides a limited view of the Group’s overall business and operational performance (from 
financial perspectives only). The continued use of the Integrated Reporting Framework is designed 
to inform providers of capital and readers, on all matters, be it financial and non-financial (including 
environmental, social and governance or ESG) matters that ultimately impact / influence value creation. 
In essence, to provide a more comprehensive and complete perspective of the Group’s business 
model, its strategies, resource dependencies, external operating environment as well as strategic 
priorities and plans going forward, over the short, medium and long-term horizons. 
Velesto’s adoption of integrated reporting is intended to provide readers with more comprehensive 
and connected disclosures that address the linkages between financial and non-financial aspects of 
the Group’s business model. These include matters related to environmental, social and governance 
(“ESG”) performance and how these impact financial, business and operational performance. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
IAR 2023 was developed based on addressing the following strategic considerations: 
Capitals consumed by the business model.
Continue to provide information material to a wide range of stakeholders including regulators, 
investors, shareholders, customers and others.
Delving beyond past financial performance to transcend silo-based limited views of Velesto. 
To present more integrated perspectives and to explore the relationship between multiple 
aspects of the Group's business
Exploring market trends and developments in the PESTLE environment and how do these 
impact the business model, business operations and strategies. 
Bringing sustainability perspectives i.e. the impact of financial and impact materialy topics 
into the mainstream of the reporting narrative. 
Forward looking information: Disclosures on the industry and Company outlook, prospects as 
well as strategic priorities going forward. 

---- Page 7 ----

information presented stretch up to 31 March 2024. Where available, in presenting performance

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
In providing readers with a more informed perspective of Velesto going forward, IAR 2023 contains 
information on the Group’s intended plans, strategies and aspirations based on industry outlook and 
prospects. These disclosures may be broad based or be presented in terms of specifics, including 
mention of performance targets, for financial and non-financial performance. 
All such forward looking information were developed based on comprehensive information available 
as a specific point in time, including assumptions made based on external operating conditions and 
other prevailing trends and developments within the PESTLE environment. Readers are advised to be

2023, including crude oil and gas prices, socio-political events, governmental policies and others. 
Hence, future oriented disclosures provided in

changes in the PESTLE environment towards

the Group’s outlook and prospects as well as its 
business plans.

OUR PURPOSE IS 
STRONGER & CLEARER

Management’s strategic efforts to ramp up internal capabilities.

Section 02  •  Leadership Statements
On behalf of the Board of Directors of 
Velesto Energy Berhad (“Velesto” or 
“the Group”), I am pleased to share the 
progress made by the Group in financial 
year ended 31 December 2023. 
In essence, in 2023, we have effectively pursued our 
four core aspects of safety, service quality, technology 
and sustainability. We embraced the challenge of 
staying current with a dynamic market, that sees new 
and more complex requirements. For example, the 
emergence of Integrated Rig Drilling & Completion 
("i-RDC") requirements, which is a challenge, yet also 
an opportunity to develop competitive advantage.
Where challenges were encountered, such as on our 
maiden i-RDC contract, lessons learnt were quickly 
applied to ensure the project was back on track.
Through the i-RDC project, we have expanded our 
internal capabilities, gained invaluable experience as 
a first mover, and have firmly established ourselves as 
ready and capable of moving forward with clients. This 
strengthens the existing trust and confidence of clients in 
Velesto, which paves the way for future opportunities, 
both locally and abroad. 
We are grateful and appreciative of our stakeholder 
partnerships, notably with clients who serve as catalysts 
in driving our progress towards attaining higher 
performance benchmarks, improved productivity and 
cost efficiency. 
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
In 2023, Group revenue more than doubled to RM1.2 
billion, 109% higher year-on-year, while pre and post-
tax earnings stood at RM121 million and RM100 
million respectively. In addition, continued efforts to 
rationalise cost through the pursuit of cost optimisation 
strategies have improved overall gross profit margins for 
the Group’s Drilling and Integrated Project Management 
("IPM") business segments.
The specific details and highlights of the Group’s 
financial and operational performance are provided 
in the Management Discussion and Analysis section of 
this Report.
As at 31 March 2024, Velesto’s order book stood 
at RM1.7 billion on the back of ongoing and new 
contracts secured during the financial year. This 
provides strong revenue and earnings visibility going 
forward well into FY2024 and FY2025. 
2023 has seen Velesto record a turnaround 
performance, delivering its most robust financial results 
since 2014. The Group has registered a strong return 
to profitability, while firmly laying the foundation for 
continued growth and progress going forward. 
Velesto’s turnaround story in 2023 was achieved on the 
back of significantly improved revenues and earnings, 
attributed to conducive market conditions as well as 
Management's continuous strategic efforts to ramp up 
internal capabilities. 
In 2023, lower but stable crude oil prices provided 
support for a sustained level of exploration and 
production (“E&P”) activities. This supported higher rig 
utilisation and daily charter rates (“DCR”) and longer 
term contracts. In addition, Velesto’s efforts to enhance 
technological capabilities, drive asset uptime and drive 
operational excellence were instrumental in positioning 
the Group to capitalise on the market uptrend. 
Through strategic decision-making, we have capitalised 
on present market dynamics to sustain growth and 
enhance shareholder value. In 2023, we grew our 
order book and looked to execute all contracts in hand 
with precision and excellence. 
Our unwavering focus on safety and service quality 
and environmental performance has seen us exceed 
clients’ expectations and the various awards received 
in 2023 attest to our industry leading accomplishments. 
We have registered an impressive 97% uptime for jack-
up ('JU") rigs, with some JUs recording 100% uptime 
performance in the second half of 2023.
We responded proactively to managing constraints 
and our efforts have been well rewarded through 
improvements in cost and operational efficiencies and 
productivity.
In 2023, Velesto registered an excellent track record, 
exemplified by a continued zero major spills, zero LTIs 
and zero fatalities performance.

DIVIDENDS
On the back of improving 
performance, the Board of Directors 
is pleased to declare the Group’s 
first dividend payout of 0.25 sen 
per share since 2014 which will 
be paid on 24 May 2024. This is 
equivalent to a payout of RM20.5 
million. 
Velesto has established Velesto 
dividend policy in August 2023.  
PRIORITISING SUSTAINABILITY 
In 2023, Velesto achieved a comparatively high score to make a strong 
re-entry as a FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia ("F4GBM") top-quartile index 
constituent. Velesto has been recognised for its sustainability efforts and 
disclosure, earning a 4-star rating in the index. Furthermore, sustainability 
ratings service provider, Sustainalytics rated Velesto as being a low ESG 
risk company.
Another notable ESG highlight was our award-winning, marine biodiversity 
conservation programme. Velesto’s coral restoration programme has been 
recognised by the 2023 Malaysia Excellence Awards as the CSR Initiative 
of the Year. 
We have continued to actively cascade our zero compromise, no-tolerance 
stance on corruption internally and to external stakeholders. These included 
our vendors and clients as we looked to bring both groups on board with 
our ongoing efforts. 
We have made it clear that suppliers who engage in such acts will not 
just be prevented from participating in tenders but will also be reported to 
the enforcement authorities accordingly. Likewise, we have also chosen to 
collaborate with clients towards setting a higher standard with regard to 
corruption and matters pertaining to corporate integrity. 
We will continue to focus on occupational safety and health, as it reduces 
the risk of disruptions to operational performance, which has a direct 
impact on our service quality and financial performance. We continue 
to make progress on emissions efficiency with a 28% reduction achieved 
in 2023 (against our 2021 baseline) based on a measurement of total 
emissions against number of operational days. 
On the social front, in 2023, Velesto entered into a partnership with the 
Sarawak Economic Development Corporation to invest in learning and 
education programmes within the state. In addition, Velesto supported 
educational equality and empowerment by equipping technology and 
infrastructure to two “Less Students School” in Miri, Sarawak. 
Our workforce is important and we have taken all measures to ensure 
the professional development and wellbeing of our employees. In 2023, 
we have continued to review and adjust the salaries and remuneration 
provided to our employees, notably for offshore crew.
Further details on the abovementioned sustainability matters and other 
material ESG topics are provided in the Sustainability Statement section 
of this Report.

LOOKING AHEAD
Looking ahead, despite geo-political tensions and further moderation in global economic 
growth, market conditions are expected to remain conducive for oil and gas majors to maintain 
or increase their E&P activities. The PETRONAS Activity Outlook indicates a positive outlook for 
the upstream segment of the oil and gas value chain. Correspondingly, demand for rigs will 
also increase to meet rising E&P activities. 
DCRs should remain or increase as marketed rig supply continues to decline even as demand 
ramps up. In addition, oil and gas companies are tendering for longer-term drilling contracts, 
signifying strong confidence in expected increase of oil and gas consumption going forward. 
We continue to build a more resilient, agile and performance-driven Company that is ready 
to operate sustainably within a dynamic operating environment that though contains risks, also 
bristles with opportunities. 
Our prospects are underpinned by a solid bedrock of high corporate governance standards, 
fiscal discipline, leading industry track record and a firm commitment to embrace sustainability 
as an enabler in driving operational excellence and achieving competitive advantage. 
Supported by strong shareholder backing from institutional investors, Velesto can leverage its 
strong balance sheet to drive business growth, including optimising internally generated funds, 
accessing financing and the capital markets.
Our ethos of Performance Driven and Operations Focused shall continue to drive the Group 
forward. It demonstrates our strategic priorities towards sustaining financial and non-financial 
stakeholder values. 
Velesto in 2024 will continue to focus on growing its order book while also continuing to 
pursue cost and operational efficiencies, within its operations and across supply chains. 
As we ramp up business development, we intend to continue ensuring a low operating cost 
base, improved productivity and to maintain excellent performance in terms of set ESG KPIs 
and targets. These include maintaining the track record for zero LTIs, fatalities and major spills. 
Indeed, we must continue to focus on acquiring technology and capabilities that will enable 
Velesto to achieve improvements in operational efficiency and capabilities. These necessitate 
investment, but the benefits will be evident, in the medium to long-term in ensuring we remain 
a preferred service provider of choice for our clients.
APPRECIATION AND 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I take this opportunity to thank my fellow Board members 
for their contributions and wise counsel. I wish the best 
of success to outgoing directors, Datuk Tong Poh Keow 
and Mohd Irwan Ahmad Mustafa, who have chosen to 
not seek re-election during the financial year. May they 
continue to do well in their future undertakings. 
In their stead, the Board welcomes Alan Hamzah 
Sendut, Fadzihan Abbas Mohamed Ramlee and 
Nadzrin Alia Md Azizis who were appointed to the 
Board during the financial year. Each brings a vast 
range of expertise and experience which enriches the 
collective knowledge and capabilities of the Board and 
we look forward to their impactful contributions going 
forward.
I also wish to thank the Senior Management for their 
leadership, for developing and effectively helming 
Velesto to a positive year. And certainly, I express the 
deepest gratitude and appreciation to our high-calibre 
workforce, who have been pivotal in our continued 
progress and successes.
Appreciation is also expressed to our investors and 
shareholders, our clients, government agencies and 
ministries, regulatory bodies and all parties who have 
been instrumental in our 2023 journey. 
The future is bright and promising, though not without 
challenges. Risks reside together with opportunities but 
we are ready and well placed to continue pursuing our 
path towards sustained value creation.

Section 02  •  Leadership Statements
Dear Stakeholders, 
In 2023, Velesto delivered 
its highest performance 
since 2014, underpinned 
by resounding 
operational excellence 
and achievements. The 
significantly improved 
financial and business 
performance, have further 
reaffirmed Velesto’s 
position as a trusted 
and leading oil and gas 
drilling services provider 
in the region. 
Velesto’s resounding return to profitability is centred on 
the Group’s key focus areas of safety, service quality, 
technology and sustainability, encapsulated in the 
corporate ethos of Performance Driven, Operations 
Focused. The Group’s continued commitment to 
operational excellence and strategic agility has enabled 
Velesto to capitalise on a stable oil and gas market 
to record a robust turnaround in performance while 
continuing to strengthen its technological and service 
capabilities and ultimately, competitive positioning. 
Throughout 2023, the Group continued to earn the 
trust and confidence of its stakeholders, namely clients 
by exemplifying professionalism, innovation and a 
constant ability to adapt in tandem with the evolving 
requirements of clients. Velesto’s positive results in 
2023 was a direct result of the strategic initiatives 
implemented to effectively navigate a dynamic and 
improving business landscape.
THE YEAR IN REVIEW 
Prevalent market conditions in 2023 were comparatively positive with crude oil prices 
averaging USD83 per barrel (Brent Crude) as compared to the highs of USD101 per barrel 
in 2022. Still, prices were comparatively less volatile as compared to 2022. On the back 
of stable crude oil prices, the momentum for upstream activities increased considerably  
in 2023. 
In Malaysia, Exploration and Production (“E&P”) and drilling activities were strong, driven 
by significant CAPEX by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (“PETRONAS”) and other oil and gas 
majors. Increased demand and continued contraction in rig supply supported higher Daily 
Charter Rates (“DCR”). 
A notable difference in 2023 was the increased confidence of clients to award drilling 
contracts for longer durations of 12-24 months compared to 3-6 month contracts in previous 
years). Longer contracts consequently lead to higher rig utilisation, higher contract values 
and provide extended revenue and earnings visibility. 
Cumulatively, stable crude oil prices, increasing rig scarcity, higher DCR, and increased 
appetite for longer contracts by clients, provided a conducive backdrop upon which, an 
operationally ready, cost competitive and technologically proficient Velesto outperformed in 
surpassing all expectations.

VELESTO IN 2023
The Group’s stellar performance 
is underscored by its ongoing 
transition in terms of technological 
capabilities, service delivery, 
organisational culture and 
sustainability focus. This corporate 
mindset has been pivotal in the 
continued revitalisation of the 
Group, which has enabled Velesto 
to leverage on market conditions to 
deliver positive performance.
The Group’s commitment to 
operational excellence, its focus 
on performance delivery and 
setting benchmark standards 
have remained mainstays. This 
has propelled Velesto to deliver 
outstanding financial and non-
financial values. The many efforts 
to re-energise Velesto, included 
revamping organisational culture; 
emphasising a high-performance, 
meritorious culture, accountability 
and ownership have been 
instrumental in delivering the 
desired productivity levels and 
optimum performance. 
Fiscal discipline was matched by a 
strategic perspective on investing, 
where necessary to facilitate 
enhanced capability. Technology 
and asset expenditure were key 
focus areas during the financial 
year, with the investments made 
delivering immediate returns and 
to continue ensuring competitive 
advantage over the next 3-5 years.

QUARTERLY & YEARLY PERFORMANCE
Delivered highest Revenue, EBITDA and PAT in recent years on the back of 
higher utilisation and average day rate
In 2023, on the back of increased rig utilisation, higher DCR and higher revenue recognition, Velesto’s revenue 
rose to RM1.2 billion, more than double of 2022’s RM581 million. EBITDA and profit after tax (“PAT”) rose by 
202% and 200% year-on-year. EBITDA stood at RM369 million (FY2022: RM122 million) while profit after tax 
stood at RM100 million (FY2022: -RM100 million). 
The biggest contributor to revenue and earnings was the Group’s Drilling segment – delivering improved revenues 
of RM799 million (FY2022: RM483 million) attributed to higher average jack-up rig utilisation of 83% and a 22% 
increase in DCR to USD94,000/day (2022: USD77,000/day). PBT stood at RM160 million. 
Velesto’s Integrated Project Management (“IPM”) segment also contributed higher revenues or RM402 million in 
2023, a 362% increase year-on-year, on the back of increased progress of works achieved on i-RDC contracts 
and with two HWUs operating during the year. PBT stood at RM23 million. 
In 2023, the drilling segment delivered 66% of the revenue and most of the Group's earnings, followed by the 
IPM segment contributing 33% and 19% to Group revenue and PBT. The 4th quarter of 2023 in particular saw the 
Group register its highest revenue and earnings performance for the financial year.
The successful progress of works achieved notably on Velesto’s i-RDC and Integrated Well Services (“IWS”), 
notably in the second half of 2023 had a direct impact on higher Drilling Services and IPM revenues and earnings 
achieved. I-RDC and IWS contracts are structured on a lump-sum basis and therefore, revenues and earnings have 
a direct correlation with project progress. The early completion of the Tembungo IWS Contract was another key 
financial contributor for the IPM segment. 
The notable distinction of i-RDC contracts as opposed to conventional drilling contracts is the former entails the 
provision of a complete solution comprising drilling rig services, equipment and, even procurement of materials to 
be provided by a single service or i-RDC contractor.

GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
REVENUE AND EARNINGS
Velesto’s RM640 million Hess i-RDC services contract is Malaysia’s first JU rig drilling contract awarded through 
an i-RDC arrangement. The scope of works entails the drilling of 14 offshore wells at Hess’ North Malay Basin full 
field development campaign for a fixed period from November 2022 to April 2024, with a possible extension 
for two months. In undertaking this contract, Velesto is collaborating with Halliburton. 
The Group’s Oilfield Services segment (“OFS“), which mainly consists of overseas operations in Tianjin, China, 
contributed RM12 million (FY2022: RM10 million) in revenue and also recorded a PBT of RM3 million.
BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW 
A distinguishing feature is Velesto’s strong balance sheet as evident in our growing asset position and low gearing 
of 0.14 times. Net debt to EBITDA ratio stands at a healthy 0.61 times. 
The excellent progress achieved on all contracts in hand have enabled strong revenue recognition and cashflows 
which has seen net cashflow generated from operating activities increase to RM376 million (FY2022: -RM3 million) 
and cash and cash equivalents including bank balances increased to RM132 million in 2023. 
Excess cash was utilised for early repayments and as at 31 December 2023, Velesto’s all-in debt has reduced to 
RM359 million. This is a significant 36% reduction year-on-year. Term loans have been pared down by up to 83% 
since 2017. On the back of prepayments, Velesto’s next repayment is only due in 2026.

OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
On the back of longer duration contracts, both JUs and HWUs posted higher utilisation rates. JU utilisation reached 
a nine-year high of 83% for the year and a high of 94% in the 4th quarter. This is a significant improvement from 
the 62% and 48% registered in 2022 and 2021 respectively. 
HWU utilisation improved to 43% on the back of GAIT 5 completed work for the PCSB Tembungo P&A project in 
October 2023 while GAIT 6 commenced work for EMEPMI in September 2023.
The Group’s commitment to operational excellence and service quality is exemplified in its 97% rig uptime achieved 
for the whole year. One of our rigs, namely NAGA 2, achieved 100% uptime in 2023. 
After facing initial challenges, Velesto’s i-RDC contract achieved excellent progress in 2023. Works were 
successfully expedited and completion is expected by the first half of 2024. Importantly, the Group is well placed 
to secure an extension to its existing i-RDC contract going forward.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
& ANALYSIS
Together with NOVOS, JUs NAGA 4 and NAGA 
8 have been fitted with Starlink Internet connection 
capability. This ensures the drilling rigs consistently 
have sufficient bandwidth and connectivity to facilitate 
rig operations and for crew wellbeing. 
The NOVOS and Starlink upgrades are part of Velesto’s 
continual asset refreshment exercise to upgrade existing 
capabilities. The Group continues to enhance its asset 
readiness and operational capabilities to remain 
capable and ready to meet clients’ requirements. 
In 2022, Velesto successfully upgraded two of its rigs 
– NAGA 5 and NAGA 6 to have offline capabilities 
(which has enabled the Group to undertake i-RDC 
contracts). Offline Capabilities technology also has 
culminated with a savings of 32 days of operational 
and project days to date (based on operations of 
NAGA 5 on the i-RDC contract).
As clients develop new expectations (in tandem with a dynamic external operating 
environment), the Group continues to proactively drive interaction on all levels of management 
and operations.
A notable aspect of Velesto’s performance in FY2023 was the emphasis on close collaboration 
and engagement with clients on performance, efficiency, health and safety and also on 
material ESG matters such as environmental and social considerations and good corporate 
governance and integrity. 
Close engagement facilitates the exchange of best practices, industry expertise, and 
technological advancements and drives Velesto’s greater proficiency as a drilling rig operator. 
Throughout 2023, constant efforts have been undertaken to maintain and enhance service 
quality levels as per the KPIs set by clients.
Keeping pace with our clients, Velesto in 2023 looked to make the necessary transition 
and upgrades to bring its JUs rigs up to par and to prepare for future requirements going 
forward. One specific focus area was in the adoption of new technologies such as NOVOS 
capabilities. Technology has emerged as a key focus area with the upgrading of assets. With 
the implementation of NOVOS, Velesto has achieved a 32% reduction in drilling time as 
opposed to conventional methods.

ESG – OUR BUSINESS ENABLER
Velesto remains abreast with the ongoing evolution in the industry. It continues to operate in a responsible manner, 
with consideration for potential and actual environmental and social impacts. Our commitment to sustainability 
extends beyond operational excellence to encompass environmental stewardship, educational advancement and 
robust governance practices. 
Velesto continues to integrate sustainability and environmental responsibility seamlessly into its offshore drilling and 
hydraulic workover operations as fundamental components of its corporate strategy. Oversight by the Board and 
Senior Management ensures that sustainability remains a pivotal aspect of the Company's agenda.
On the back of continued vigilance, strengthening of Occupational Safety and Health ("OSH") measures at all 
vessels and onshore sites, the Group has continued to set the benchmark for excellence with regard to OSH. 2023 
saw Velesto continues to record a zero loss time injury (“LTI”) and zero fatality performance in 2023. In addition, 
zero major spills were recorded during the year. 
The constant inculcation of a no-compromise, safety first mindset at all times has been instrumental in development 
of an organisational culture centred on the core attributes of precision and professionalism, and that everyone 
returns home safely once tasks are completed. Through the years, a strong "espirit de corp" continues to be 
developed based on personal and collective accountability and ownership, reporting transparency and being 
proactive rather than reactive at all times. 
The implementation of improved safety performance on rig floors with Redzone Management is part of the 
preventive approach to ensuring optimal OSH performance. This addresses potential health and safety incidents 
well in advance through the use of leading OSH indicators such as near misses, unsafe acts, unsafe conditions 
and more. 
Among the OSH highlights for the year were 58 management visits including joint client-Velesto visits, of which I 
had personally participated in 11 visits.
The number of OSH related awards and citations accorded to Velesto by oil and gas majors further attest to the 
Group’s industry leading performance in 2023.

PRIORITISING TALENT MANAGEMENT AND PEOPLE
Velesto’s 732 strong workforce has always been an integral part of the Group’s ability towards 
maintaining operational excellence. Hence, the prioritisation of staff welfare, training and 
morale and satisfaction are strategic considerations in maintaining optimum productivity and 
driving cost and operational efficiencies and competitive ability. 
Group Human Resources continued to focus on organisational culture and in ensuring 
competitive remuneration and rewards for staff. In 2023, consistent with the Group’s improved 
financial performance, an ESOS grant was provided to eligible employees. 
Management remains well attuned to the importance of the Group’s talent pool in driving 
continuous improvement, innovation and in spurring further operational excellence. Hence, 
the emphasis on meritorious performance – embedding a mindset of personal and collective 
accountability and ownership among staff, especially offshore crews. This approach 
progressively cultivates leadership and motivation that drives competency, meticulousness and 
pride of work, which results in a bottom-up impetus towards productivity and quality. 
In 2023, this strategy has clearly yielded positive outcomes, notably among several rig 
crews. The same year, our rig crews took the lead in pursuing cost and energy efficiencies 
and optimisation. Rig energy consumption and emissions increased by 16%. However, rig 
emissions intensity by operating days and revenue decreased by 28% and 62% respectively. 
Another focus area was reorientating towards cross functional working practices as opposed 
to typical silo approaches. This emphasised teamwork, sharing of information, ideas and 
best practices, closer co-operation, all of which have delivered improved productivity across 
operations. 
DEVELOPING INDUSTRY TALENT AND SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
Through Velesto Drilling Academy (“VDA”), in 2023, Velesto has produced 1,135 internal and 
external trainees, professionally trained drilling talents for the local industry. 
VDA supports Velesto’s talent pipeline, ensuring a steady flow of competent talent to meet 
the Group’s business requirements while also upskilling locals and enabling access to higher-
income jobs. This has a positive socio-economic impact on local communities and families 
while contributing to the availability of a reliable talent pool for the oil and gas industry. 
TOWARDS NET ZERO EMISSION
In terms of carbon emissions, Velesto has achieved 
a 28% reduction in emission intensity per operating 
day against its 2021 baseline. The aforementioned 
carbon reduction surpassed the Group’s internal target. 
Reduction was achieved by continuous efforts to reduce 
rig emissions as well as emissions for onshore operating 
bases in Labuan and Kemaman. 
Other measures implemented included integration 
of power management systems in 50% of our rigs to 
reduce engine run time and improve efficiency, solar 
installations in both Labuan and Kemaman, use of 
energy-efficient LED lighting at offshore and onshore, 
adoption of variable frequency drive ("VFD") and 
efficient motor systems on all rigs, improvements in fuel 
management processes, leveraging big data analytics 
for emissions management and performance analytics, 
continuous staff awareness and education sessions 
and development of a comprehensive full-year GHG 
inventory. 
Having inventorised Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
the Management is further operationalising energy 
efficiency and emissions reduction initiatives through 
developing and implementing best practices across 
the JU fleet. Tactical measures include establishment of 
carbon emissions targets for all rigs.
Moving forward, Velesto has pledged to Net Zero 
Emission 2050 in FY2024 and subsequently to establish 
science-based decarbonisation pathway and targets by 
2025. Specific information on Velesto’s management 
approach to energy consumption and carbon emissions 
is detailed in the Sustainability Statement section of this 
Report.

OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS
The US based Energy Information Administration 
expects global crude oil production to rise marginally 
to 102.6 mil barrels per day while global consumption 
relatively balanced at 102.9 million barrels per day. 
Global production of liquid fuels is forecast to increase 
by an average 0.9 million bpd in 2024, with a 
possible increase of 2 million bpd in 2025. The bulk of 
demand will stem from non-OECD Asia, led by China 
and India. 
Hence barring any major unforeseen events, 2024’s 
level of activities is expected to be comparable to 
2023, extending possibly into 2025 and a possible 
upside in 2026. The optimism is evidenced in the 
continued headroom for DCR on the back of increased 
demand yet contracting rig supply. 
Global rig demand stands at 409 rigs as opposed 
to global supply availability of 435 with a marketed 
utilisation rate of 94%. In Southeast Asia, contracted 
rig supply stands at 35 with Malaysia accounting 
for 12 contracted rigs. Given Malaysia has a 100% 
marketed utilisation, and the tight supply conditions in 
Southeast Asia and globally, it is possible that DCR 
could also increase in tandem with limited rig supply to 
USD72,000 - USD165,000 in Southeast Asia and to 
USD90,000 - USD145,000 in Malaysia. This robust 
activity forecast aligns with the PETRONAS Activity 
Outlook ("PAO") indicating sustained momentum in the 
region.
The latest PAO forecasts up to 99 wells slated for 
drilling under PETRONAS’ development, appraisal and 
exploration drilling programme. Of these, 74 are for 
development drilling with six for appraisal and 19 for 
exploration. PETRONAS’ long-term target is to maintain 
a production level of two million bpd with exploration 
drilling of more than 25 wells over the 2024-2036 
period. This augurs well for JU rig operators.
Beyond E&P, other opportunities in the domestic oil and 
gas sector include decommissioning of end-of-life assets 
as well as plug and abandonment projects.

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR FY2024
As at 31 March 2024, Velesto’s order book has expanded to RM1.7 billion on the back of 99% firm, long and 
short-term contracts. This provides the Group with revenue and earnings visibility going well into 2026. 
The Group intends to leverage on the present scarcity of marketed rigs in Malaysia and the region to actively 
tender for projects extending into 2025 and 2026. Focus will be on securing longer-term contracts to increase our 
earnings visibility going forward. 
At the same time, Velesto shall continue to tender for contracts for its HWUs. This indicates a proactive approach 
to expanding service offerings and further reducing reliance on JU based revenue streams.
Given its position as the largest local drilling rig player, a proven track record, and its expanding capabilities, 
including offline and other technological capabilities, the Group is well placed to meet the evolving and increasingly 
more complex technical requirements of oil and gas majors.

Management’s primary focus is to ensure asset readiness and capability through technological and 
operational advancements. This includes the integration of new technologies and tools. Management 
will continue to consider all factors including the rate of increasing demand for offline capabilities and 
High Pressure High Temperature (“HPHT”) requirement. 
In the event it is beneficial to upgrade more rigs with offline and HPHT capabilities, Velesto has the 
financial strength to fund the exercise by leveraging internally generated funds as well as external 
borrowings. The Group’s low gearing levels supports access to financing if required. 
Management shall continue to explore opportunities for expansion within the oil and gas sector, 
while also prioritising the introduction of technologically advanced products and services. Also, talent 
retention and development remains a core strategic priority going forward. This include equipping 
the workforce with the relevant competencies and to ensure future readiness amidst a rapidly evolving 
industry. 
On a related note, Velesto will be undertaking Special Periodical Surveys (“SPS”) for rigs NAGA 2, 
NAGA 3, NAGA 5 and NAGA 6, thus rendering those assets to be unavailable for approximately 
a period of 2-3 months each. However, it is imperative that these exercises be conducted towards 
ensuring optimal performance capabilities. These include integrated capabilities, innovative solutions, 
increased automation and technologically enhanced approaches. 
Management wishes to reiterate that the Group has developed a clear SPS process including effective 
mitigation plans to ensure the Group’s ability to execute contracts is not affected and that disruptions, 
if any are minimal. 
CHALLENGES AND RISKS
The upstream segment of the oil and gas sector 
has inherent risks and is increasingly facing new 
and emerging risks, notably ESG related risks. 
These risks include a plummet in crude oil prices 
due to uncontrollable external developments, 
escalation in operating costs, OSH incidents, 
manpower and project execution risks as well as 
risks arising from poor governance in particular 
environmental and social governance within the 
supply chain. Specific information on these risks 
including impacts and mitigation strategies are 
provided in the Creating Value Through Our 
Strategy section, of this Integrated Annual Report.

OUR VALUE
CHAIN
Velesto’s business model is centred on the provision of drilling and 
hydraulic workover services for undertaking exploration and production 
(“E&P") activities. E&P comes under the upstream segment of the oil and 
gas sector. The entire oil and gas value chain can be categorised into three 
broad segments: 
Velesto’s fleet of jack-up (“JU”) drilling rigs are hired on short and long-term contracts for crude oil and gas extraction. The Group’s hydraulic workover 
units are employed for a variety of oil well related activities, such as well intervention, rejuvenation and abandonment and decommissioning activities.

UPSTREAM BUSINESS PROCESSES CHALLENGES & CONSIDERATIONS
Exploration: data gathering and 
well exploration
Exploration activities must be strategically undertaken towards ensuring the highest possibility of finding 
oil and gas deposits. Challenges such as the physical environment, the location of the deposits, 
complexity of the required drilling process and other factors may impede the success of exploration 
activities.
Well development facilities and 
commissioning Offshore drilling is more challenging than onshore drilling due to the lack of stability (particularly for 
floaters), the corrosive water environment, space constraints and the need for more complex logistics 
and support.Production of oil and gas
Well plugging and abandonment 
Cost effective and safe plugging of wells is essential to prevent crude oil contaminating the marine 
environment.
Decommissioning is a requirement and must be performed in accordance with industry standards. 
Given Malaysia’s maturing oil and gas industry, there is an increasing number of less productive or 
economically viable oil wells that require plugging and abandonment.
Velesto provides a start-to-end solution from well exploration to plug and 
abandonment
Following is the business model by key processes or phases:
Surveying
Preliminary activities include geological surveys, gravity surveys, magnetic surveys and seismic surveys. 
If a location with potentially high oil and gas deposits is identified, said location is earmarked for 
exploration drilling.
Exploration drilling 
commences
Velesto’s JU rigs are towed to the exploration site/field. Exploratory wells are drilled down into the 
seabed to locate oil and gas deposits.
Multiple oil wells may be drilled to ascertain flow rates and reservoir dynamics as well as to determine 
commercial viability of the site/field. The duration of the drilling process may vary, from days to weeks 
or months based on soil conditions, weather, equipment quality and crew competency.
Hydrocarbons found 
(production drilling 
commences)
When exploration is successful, activities transition to the production phase.
Velesto installs production equipment using its rigs to facilitate extraction of the oil and gas resources. 
Hydrocarbons are extracted from the seabed and are transported to an onshore refining facility through 
underwater pipelines.
Further drilling to 
increase production
Clients leverage on data sourced from the ongoing drilling process, to refine ongoing drilling activities. 
More production wells may be drilled or injection wells used to undertake well rejuvenation or repair 
activities to improve the flow rate of crude oil or gas. This may entail the requirement of a smaller 
workover rig to repair wells, enhance production or provide other forms of well treatment.
Decommissioning
Once the well has been exhausted or drilling is unproductive, at the client’s instruction, Velesto plugs 
the well to prevent environmental impacts. The drilling rig is transported to a new exploration and / or 
new production location and the process is repeated.

APPLICATION
The most common type 
of offshore rig due to its 
flexibility. Typically used 
for drilling in shallow 
waters.
More common in shallow 
waters. Allows drilling 
from smaller platforms.
The most stable type of 
rig, typically used for 
drilling in deepwater and/
or harsh environments.
Typically used for drilling 
in deepwater/ultra 
deepwater environments. 
Can also be used for well 
maintenance, completion 
and capping works.
Typically used for 
workover operations 
e.g. well casings and 
casing levels repair, sand 
cleanout, etc.
ASSOCIATED SERVICES
Supporting vessels, Oil Country Tubular Goods (“OCTG”), third party drilling services e.g. drilling fluids, Directional 
Drilling (“DD”)/Measurement While Drilling (“MWD”)/Logging While Drilling (“LWD”), wellheads, drill bits, 
cementing, fishing, slickline, etc.
Supporting vessels, 
slickline, cementing, etc.

Section 03  •  Creating Value Through Our Strategy
JU rigs are floated out to the drilling location and have retractable legs that are lowered down to the seafloor. When drilling is completed, the legs are 
raised out of the water, and the rig becomes a floating barge that can be towed away (‘wet tow’) or placed on a large transport ship (‘dry tow’).
THE THREE MOST COMMON TYPES OF JU RIGS ARE:
STANDARD:
These are typically older rigs that  
have a low hook-load capacity and 
rely mostly on mechanically operated 
drilling equipment with little 
automation. Standard rigs operate at 
water depths of less than 300 feet. 
However, standard rigs can do almost 
the same job as high- speci/f_ication 
rigs at a much lower rate. 
HIGH-
SPECIFICATION RIGS:
Rigs that typically operate at 
depths of up to 400 feet due to 
their modern automation 
systems and drilling 
equipment.
Note: Velesto’s current /f_leet of 
JU rigs are categorised as 
high-speci/f_ication rigs.
HARSH-
ENVIRONMENT RIGS:
Mainly used in the North Sea 
and is able to cope with harsh 
weather and rough sea 
conditions. Typically can drill 
up to 490 feet
Since 2022, Velesto’s rigs NAGA 5 and NAGA 6 have been equipped with 
offline capabilities while NAGA 4 has been fitted with NOVOS automated 
drilling capabilities in 2023.

MATTERS IMPACTING 
THE BUSINESS MODEL AND 
VALUE CREATION 
Velesto has identified its financial materiality matters as per the following:
GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND DYNAMICS FOR CRUDE OIL AND GAS 
The level of E&P activities is dependent on the global demand and supply dynamics for crude oil and 
gas. In 2023, demand for global crude oil stood at 101 million barrels per day, against a supply of 
102 million barrels per day. 
Crude oil prices held firm, averaging USD83 per barrel (Brent Crude) in 2023. While average prices 
were lower year-on-year, oil and gas majors continued to maintain an expansionary stance, ramping 
up E&P activities to replenish depleting inventory levels and to meet growing consumption demand. 
In Malaysia, where Velesto primarily operates, there were increased tenders called for E&P projects 
and Velesto participated actively, securing several contracts during the financial year.
STRATEGIC MEASURES IMPLEMENTED
Velesto actively bid for contracts and continued to focus on operational excellence and cost efficiency, 
Velesto focused on ensuring asset readiness and mobilisation of offshore crews and personnel to 
ensure effective capacity to undertake secured contracts.
VALUES CREATED 
On the back of contracts in hand and new projects secured during the year, Velesto’s JU utilisation 
rate averaged 83% for 2023 with the Group’s order book growing to RM1.7 billion. Group revenue 
doubled to RM1.2 billion, while Profit after tax stood at RM100 million.
CAPITALS CONSUMED
A wide range of capitals were utilised to power the Group’s business development activities as well 
as in the mobilisation of assets and execution of contracts. 
These capitals include human capital, outlay of funds to ensure vessel and crew readiness and also 
the investment in equipping NAGA 4 with NOVOS automated drilling capabilities and supporting 
STARLINK, satellite-based internet connection.

SCOPE AND BASIS OF REPORTING
Presented herein is the Sustainability Statement 2023 
(“SS2023” or “Statement”) for Velesto Energy Berhad 
("Velesto" or the "Group"), covering the financial period 
spanning 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. This 
Statement has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 
Standards and marks the Group’s 8th annual publication 
of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) 
disclosures in adherence with our Listing Requirements. 
Our SS2023 serves as a transparent communication channel for outlining the proactive steps taken 
to integrate sustainable practices throughout the Group's operations, while providing details and 
updates on the tangible outcomes achieved thus far in our ongoing sustainability journey. The 
Statement also offers a holistic measure of the positive and negative impacts of our business activities 
on stakeholders, the environment and the future prospects of the organisation.
Scope, Boundary and Exclusions
Adopting a "local where-we-operate" approach, the reporting scope of our SS2023 encompasses 
all subsidiaries of Velesto, including all primary business operations in drilling services, integrated 
project management services, and oilfield services. This covers data and information pertaining to the 
Group's operational assets of offices, warehouses, six jack-up rigs ("JU") and three hydraulic workover 
units ("HWUs").
Where feasible, statistical data spanning three consecutive years is presented across this Statement, 
providing context to facilitate comparisons and highlight trends and trajectories. 
As we are a drilling services contractor and do not own the resources extracted for clients, this 
Statement excludes ESG impacts arising from oil and gas resources discovered, produced, owned, 
and consumed by our clients and entities upstream of the Group's value chain. Impacts of associate 
companies in which we assume no direct managerial control are also excluded from this Statement.
Linkage to Integrated Reporting
For a comprehensive perspective on the interplay between our financial and sustainability 
performance, we recommend reviewing this SS2023 in conjunction with Velesto's Integrated Annual 
Report ("IAR2023"). The IAR2023 provides an in-depth exploration of the Company's business 
strategy, external operating environment, business model and other strategic information. Together, 
these Statements offer a comprehensive understanding of Velesto's overall performance and the 
synergies between our financial and sustainability initiatives.
Precautionary Approach
Sustainability remains intrinsic to our risk 
management strategy at Velesto, fortifying 
the Group’s business model and guiding our 
attention towards potential growth opportunities. 
Applying a precautionary approach, we 
seamlessly integrate risk mitigation strategies into 
our ESG management framework, leveraging 
on this proactive stance to avert Occupational 
Safety and Health ("OSH") incidents while 
concurrently curtailing potential adverse social 
and environmental impacts arising from our 
operations.
REPORTING STANDARDS
This SS2023 has been prepared in alignment with: 
BURSA Sustainability 
Reporting Guide 3rd 
Edition
Global Reporting 
Initiative (“GRI”) 
Standards 2021:  
Core Option
Task Force on Climate-
related Financial 
Disclosures ("TCFD")
Also benchmark disclosure against the indicators of:

ABOUT THIS

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
Dear Stakeholders, 
In the past twelve months, Velesto has made significant strides across the ESG spectrum, marking important 
milestones in our sustainability journey. By strengthening our governance, management framework and strategies, 
we have sharpened our focus on long-term goals and positioned ourselves favourably to tackle the challenges and 
seize the opportunities that are ahead.
Progressing along our sustainability journey, we acknowledge the paramount importance of sustaining our financial 
performance. Our strengthened revenue and profitability in FY2023 have facilitated increased distribution of 
shared value to stakeholders through dividends, employee pay outs and taxes thus ensuring the continued growth 
and stability of our organisation.
The foundation of our achievements is derived from our performance supported by an improved utilisation rate of 
our assets driven by heightened demand for energy supply. This is further reinforced by our dedication to fostering 
a 'Performance Driven, Operation Focused' ethos, resulting in outstanding quality services and operational uptime 
reaching 97% throughout the year. This synergy between optimised asset utilisation and a culture of exceptional 
performance has been instrumental in our success.
A pivotal component of our achievements is garnered in the continual integration of technology and innovation within 
our operations and processes. Notably in FY2023, this commitment was demonstrated through a collaborative 
effort with a client in the implementation of a pilot system aimed at enhancing rig operational efficiency. Beyond 
operation enhancements, we actively engage with our vendors to advance operational best practices and foster 
sustainability improvements across our supply chain.
"Velesto is proud to announce our commitment towards Net Zero Emission 
2050 in FY2024. We will intensify efforts to gain deeper understanding on our 
emission footprint and identify science-based pathway for decarbonisation. 
Our aim is to develop a comprehensive Net Zero roadmap by year-end."

P. 052 … 053
We are encouraged that our concerted efforts to strengthen Group-wide ESG practices have been 
recognised through improved independent market ratings. In FY2023, we made several significant 
improvements. Our FTSE4Good Index ESG score rose from 2.9 to 3.8. We were recognised by 
BURSA with a 4-star ESG rating positioning us among the Top 25% ESG performers among Public 
Listed companies and were rated as being low ESG risk company by sustainability ratings service 
provider, Sustainalytics. We were also honoured with multiple safety awards from clients recognising 
our commitment to safety and operational excellence.
Beyond our value chain, we are committed to expanding our coral restoration efforts at Perhentian 
Island in 2024, to contribute to the broader understanding of coral conservation methods while 
raising awareness among the public. Additionally, we are deepening our partnership with Sarawak 
Economic Development Corporate ("SEDC") to drive community impact through sustainable education 
initiatives. By focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math ("STEM") fields, we aim to 
foster innovation and awareness in learning. These efforts underscore our dedication to internal 
engagement, external impact on the planet and people, as we strive to build a more sustainable 
future for all.
While we are proud of our efforts and achievements, we acknowledge the sustainability challenges 
inherent in the dynamic energy landscape in which we operate. Notably, FY2023 marked significant 
milestones with the inaugural presence of oil and gas companies at COP28 and the landmark launch 
of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter, signalling a collective commitment by the sector to 
environmental stewardship.
At Velesto, our dedication to a fair energy transition remains unwavering. We have pledged to 
achieve a 10% reduction in emissions intensity per operating day and 30% reduction in emissions 
intensity in terms of revenue by 2030. As we move forward, we continue to navigate towards a 
sustainable future to ensure that we balance progress with responsibility.
To this end, we remain vigilant in monitoring emerging ESG regulations, including the adoption 
of Integrated Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (“TNFD”), alongside local regulations from regulators, clients, and investors. We are 
also cognizant of how Malaysia’s recently launched National Energy Transition Roadmap (“NETR”) 
will shape the future energy industry, and will seek to participate in opportunities presented by this 
transition. 
The Group continuous efforts in nurturing ESG 
culture goes beyond mere compliance. It is 
woven into the fabric of everything we do. 
We understand the critical role economic 
performance plays in creating lasting value 
sustainably. That is why, we will prioritise 
improving our commercial model, enhancing 
operational excellence through technological 
innovation and strengthening financial prudence. 
These strategies will be ingrained in our 
workforce, empowering every individual to play 
their part in driving collective action. Alongside, 
we are investing in enhancing the competencies 
our people, both operational and sustainability-
related, so they can contribute meaningfully to 
our overarching goals.
Environmental stewardship remains at the 
forefront of our priorities. We continuously 
evaluate the impact of our operations on the 
environment and enhancing our strategies to 
mitigate it. In alignment with our commitment to 
decarbonize our value chain, we have pledged 
towards achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
in FY2024. This year, our focus will be on 
thoroughly understanding our emission footprint 
and identifying science-based pathways to 
decarbonisation. By the end of the year, we 
aim to contribute to the development of a 
comprehensive Net Zero roadmap.
I want to extend my sincere appreciation to our 
employees, partners and stakeholders for their 
invaluable contributions and steadfast support. 
Together, we will continue our journey towards 
consistent and sustainable value creation, with 
positive social and environmental impacts 
resonating for generations to come.
Sincerely,
Ir. Ts. Megat Zariman Abdul Rahim
President, Velesto Energy Berhad

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
Our Board of Directors set the tone for steering sustainability across the Group, assuming 
ultimate responsibility for all ESG matters and playing a pivotal role in defining the 
Company's sustainability strategies and priorities. Meanwhile, our Senior Management  
team takes the helm in steering the Group towards its objectives, with ESG goals and 
targets set within their purview.
Sustainability Leadership Driven from The Top
To enshrine an overarching commitment to responsible practices, the Board and Senior Management  
have integrated sustainability as one of the focus pillars of the Group’s Wawasan 2030 strategic 
roadmap. This has intrinsically linked our sustainability agenda with our business strategy, providing 
our workforce with a clear perspective of our sustainability priorities and their alignment with the 
Group’s long-term value creation plans. 
In crafting sustainability strategies and priorities, the Board maintains keen oversight on all matters 
identified as material across the Environmental, Social and Governance spectrum (see Material 
Matters on page 68-73). 
To effectively discharge its duties, the Board is supported by various committees within our sustainability 
governance structure, namely the Board Risk Management Committee ("BRMC"), the Sustainability 
Management Committee ("SMC") and the Sustainability Working Group ("SWG"). These committees 
feature distinct subgroups overseeing ESG matters, with the SMC oversee Economic strategies and 
performance. 
Velesto’s President serves as the Chairman of the SMC, enabling direct guidance to Senior 
Management leaders in effectively operationalising the Group's sustainability strategy.
This robust and cohesive governance structure 
ensures our Board and Senior Management  
team stay well-informed on all emerging ESG 
matters, while fostering effective communication 
across organisation to convey objectives and 
directives, receive feedback and make realistic 
adjustments to strategies in tandem with our 
evolving capacity, capabilities and sustainability 
goals. 
To stay abreast of the dynamic sustainability 
landscape, the Board and Senior Management  
remain committed to attending relevant 
sustainability training programmes, including 
those organised by market regulators and 
professional associations.

Embedding ESG Considerations into Risk Management
Our Board discussions have increasingly centered on ESG matters (1) , reflecting a deepening 
understanding and appreciation of their significant impact on the Group's value creation objectives. 
Consequently, we have progressively integrated more ESG considerations into our business process, 
enhancing our ability to monitor and assess the likelihood and potential impact of these sustainability 
issues on our business. In doing so, we are able to identify immediate or potential opportunities 
as part of our risk mitigation measures. Sustainability and ESG concerns have also received 
heightened emphasis in shaping the strategic plans and priorities undertaken by the Board and 
Senior Management team. In FY2023 and onwards, Sustainability and ESG have been included as 
permanent agenda at the BRMC meetings.
The Group's Enterprise Risk Management (2)(3)  policy provides comprehensive guidance for systematically 
identifying risks that are pertinent to our operations. During our annual materiality assessments, we 
further enhance our risk identification process by referencing external risk management frameworks 
and corporate reporting standards, as detailed below, to comprehensively pinpoint the full gamut of 
ESG risks relevant to our business sector and operating environment.
• ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard
• Integrated Reporting Principles Based Framework
• Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards 2021
• FTSE Russell’s ESG Data Model
• Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)
Once relevant risks are identified, designated risk owners categorise the severity and likelihood of the 
risks' impact and seeks oversight from the Board Risk Management Committee (“BRMC”) to mitigate 
these risks and implement controls. The BRMC is tasked with providing guidance on the Group's risk 
parameters and appetites, notifying the Board if a specific ESG matter is at risk of surpassing the 
Group's risk tolerance. Beyond risk assessment, the Group manages the potential impacts of identified 
risks via its Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework(4)  to ensure operational readiness, 
resilience, safeguarding stakeholders' interests, brand equity, and reputation. Crises arise during our 
business activities are also manage according to our internal Crisis Management(5)  Plan to minimise 
potential damage.
Looking ahead, the Group aims to broaden the scope of our risk management framework to 
encompass more ESG risk factors, while seeking to establish clear linkages between the financial 
and operational impacts that may arise from these sustainability matters.

Subsequent to our FY2023 materiality assessment, several changes were made to the categorisation of our material topics in this year’s Sustainability 
Statement. The topics of ‘Water’ and ‘Biodiversity’ have been respectively renamed to ‘Environmental Impact’ and ‘Nature & Biodiversity’ to encompass a 
more holistic review of our environmental and marine conservation practices. Meanwhile, our previous disclosures categorised under ‘Talent Management’ 
have been included within an expanded ‘Employment Practices’ topic, while the topic of ‘Anti-Bribery & Corruption’ has been similarly assimilated into a 
new ‘Governance & Ethics’ disclosure, providing a more comprehensive overview of our initiatives to ensure responsible business conduct.
These adjustments to our reporting framework reflect our ongoing evolution to improve our sustainability reporting, increasing the transparency and clarity 
of our disclosures to provide stakeholders with greater insights into our objectives, strategies and performance. The following table provides an overview 
of our 13 material topics, with further details provided within each individual topic in the Sustainable Value Creation section of this Report.

Environment
Climate Risk
Integrating climate 
considerations into 
business strategies 
and risk management 
while contributing 
to the national and 
stakeholders’ climate 
aspirations
Climate change is existential threats to 
all and in specific to business such as 
Velesto with exposure to its physical 
risks and transition risks that may 
impact our operating environment, 
reputation and business opportunity
• Operational disruption, increasing 
cost of repairs and downtime, and 
potential loss of revenue due to 
increasing extreme weather events
• Increase in cost due to exposure to 
carbon tax
• Lack of access to funding 
prioritising robust climate 
governance
• Tap into new market in line with 
shifting client preferences
• Diversification of revenue including 
‘green’ revenue
• Improved operational planning 
supported by resilience business 
strategies
Environmental Impacts
Advocacy of 
environmentally-friendly 
practices which include 
the management of 
water and effluent, 
waste, and pollution 
control
The Group operates in offshore 
environment involving extraction of 
natural resources thus requiring us to 
uphold highest standard of pollution 
mitigation and control, and regulatory 
compliance to ensure minimal to zero 
environmental impact
• Exposure to legal ramifications and 
fines due to regulatory violations 
• Reputational damage caused 
by poor environmental impact 
management
• Increase compliance cost due to 
inefficient waste and resources 
management
• Improve circularity and reduce 
wastage leads to cost saving
• Build positive reputation and 
ensure regulatory compliance
Nature & Biodiversity
Reflect the 
consideration of 
responsible operation 
where we operate 
through damage 
mitigation and creating 
positive impact to 
marine ecosystem
Our efforts go beyond pollution 
mitigation but also in ways that can 
create nature positive impact towards 
preservation of natural ecosystem and 
promotion of environmental awareness

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Approach Management description and initiatives
Climate 
governance
• The Board exercises diligent oversight over all climate-related aspects of our business, ensuring strict adherence 
to relevant standards. The Group is also considering and planning the formulation of a sustainability policy, 
in which climate change will be emphasised as a pivotal governance concern.
• In setting our commitments, we have set emission targets during FY2022 to achieve a 10% reduction 
in emissions intensity per operating day and 30% reduction in emissions intensity in terms of revenue by 
2030. These objectives have been incorporated not only into our corporate scorecard but also into the Key 
Performance Indicators ("KPIs") of our operational teams.
• During the past year, we have also enhanced our alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (“TCFD”), further solidifying our climate strategy and risk management framework as we pledge 
our commitment to Net Zero 2050 ambition in 2024 and ramp up to develop our decarbonisation strategy 
and roadmap. 
• In support of the new commitment, Velesto will be revising its current emission targets to a more ambitious target 
aligned with the Paris Agreement. This will be finalised upon the completion of our upcoming decarbonisation 
roadmap.
Read more in our TCFD section on page 113 of this Statement.
Data monitoring 
& disclosure
• We recognise the importance of accurate measurements and disclosures in driving us towards our climate 
ambitions. Our practices in this area, which currently extend to monitoring our Scope 1, Scope 2 and limited 
Scope 3 emissions, are guided by recognised international practices such as GRI, alongside local capital 
market requirements stipulated by BURSA Sustainability Reporting Requirements and F4GBM. Simultaneously 
we have adopted the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to align our data collection and emissions 
calculation with international best practices. 
• Moving forward, we will be focusing on enhancing our emission inventory across scope 1 and 2, expanding 
our Scope 3 disclosures and validating our emissions baseline to support the development of our Net Zero 
2050 roadmap.
Technology
• Our primary sources of energy consumption are the diesel used to power our rigs and HWUs, and the 
electricity consumed by our onshore operations, which include our corporate headquarter and warehouses in 
Malaysia, as well as our oilfield services in Tianjin, China. To optimise energy consumption, we are actively 
adopting new technologies and practices that increase energy efficiency across all aspects of our operations. 
Our Energy and Emissions Optimisation Initiatives in 2023:
• Asset Care – piloted on one of our rigs (NAGA 4) with emission profiling module to help better understand 
our power consumption and efficiency level by equipment/ machinery onboard. Allow for insights to plan 
for emission management improvement.
• Digital Dashboard – to monitor our emission trend across our operational activities to provide analytics of 
our performance on monthly basis.
• Rig power management system ("RPMS") - Utilised RPMS at NAGA 4, 5 and 8, which possesses the 
capability to detect when rig equipment requires lower power. By autonomously adjusting the engine 
for more efficient energy usage during drilling operations, we can reduce engine running hours and 
associated emissions.
• Variable frequency drive ("VFD") – all top drive drilling equipment are built in with VFD for efficient energy 
distribution during activity. In 2023, similar approach is being piloted for other equipment such as at the 
accommodation AHU.
• Efficient lighting – implemented in stages on the rigs with focus on accommodation area.
• Continuous assessment and capital allocation into piloting new technology that helps with process 
efficiency and decarbonisation of our operation including energy storage system, greener alternative fuel, 
and other emerging technology.
Stakeholder 
engagement 
& capability 
building
• We persist in conducting awareness and knowledge-sharing sessions on sustainability, climate change and 
energy management through town halls, focus groups and other platforms.
 • Additionally, we regularly update our emission performance to clients for project reporting and engage with 
key stakeholders, such as investors, to ensure transparency. In 2024, we have incorporated capability-building 
sessions as operational KPIs to further instill a culture of sustainability appreciation within our workforce.

Hydraulic Workover Units ("HWUs") 
• GAIT 1, GAIT 5, GAIT 6
• Office (KL Headquarter) 
• Warehouse (Kemaman and Labuan) 
• Oilfield Services (Tianjin)(1)(2)
While our total emissions increased in 2023 compared to the previous year, this was primarily due to a higher number of operating days and utilisation 
rate at our rigs, which contribute 99% of our emissions. The true success of our initiatives outlined above are highlighted within our emissions intensity 
results, whereby we achieved a 28% reduction in carbon intensity per operating days and a 62% reduction in carbon intensity per unit revenue. 
These results already surpass our 2030 targets of achieving a 10% reduction in carbon intensity per operating days and a 30% reduction in carbon 
intensity per unit revenue. Moving forward, we will closely monitor our performance and undertake a reassessment of our climate targets in tandem with 
our ongoing results.

MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
WHY IT MATTERS 
Our operations primarily revolve around resource extraction from the marine environment. This pollution sensitive ecosystem requires us to uphold the 
highest standards in pollution mitigation and control, as incidents like major oil spills or improper waste disposal can affect marine ecosystems and coastal 
communities. Therefore, we place great emphasis on preventing spills during the use of drilling fluid or fuel, and responsibly managing hazardous waste 
and effluents generated from our operations and water consumption to ensure minimal to no environmental impact.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Robust Governance of 
Environmental Matters
• The Board, through the BRMC, maintains vigilant oversight on all matters pertaining to our environmental impact, 
receiving quarterly updates on initiatives and performance during scheduled BRMC meetings. 
• The Group's commitment to environmental excellence is underscored by the attainment of ISO 14001:2015 
certification across all subsidiaries, with annual audits conducted to affirm our adherence to globally recognised 
standards.
• We have established specific objectives and targets to drive awareness and concerted action across our operations, 
with our primary goal within the realm of environmental management being to maintain an impeccable track record 
of zero major spills.
• Moving forward, we aim to conduct a more in-depth analysis of our performance parameters and explore the 
feasibility of setting targets for addressing additional environmental impacts. Concurrently, we are committed to 
continuously advancing our efforts in responsibly managing resources such as water and minimising the waste 
generated by our operations.
Advocating Policy and 
Regulatory Adherence
• Our environmental management practices are subject to stringent regulations, ensuring that our operations align 
with the commitments outlined in our various environmental policies and procedures (refer to page 61 for details on 
our Velesto Group policies). 
• All our offshore rig designs are certified according to American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and Det Norske Veritas 
("DNV") classifications, with our waste management plans adhering strictly to the requirements of the Annexes of 
the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78), covering aspects such as 
waste management, spill containment, effluent management and more.
• Certain types of waste generated from both our offshore and onshore operations require specialised handling 
procedures. These wastes are transferred to shore and managed in an environmentally responsible manner, 
adhering to the standards set by the Malaysia Department of Environment’s (“DOE”) Environmental Quality 
(Scheduled Waste) Regulation 2005. 
Robust Monitoring and 
Disclosure
• Our measurement and disclosure of environmental metrics pertaining to water, waste and pollution adhere to 
recognised international practices such as GRI, alongside local regulations outlined by Bursa Malaysia and 
F4GBM. 
• These metrics, detailed in the ESG performance table on page 119-128 of this report, undergo periodic monitoring 
and are regularly updated to management for analysis of performance and areas of improvement.
Implementing Controls 
and Technologies
• We consistently integrate a range of technologies, systems and processes to uphold responsible environmental 
practices and mitigate environmental risks throughout our operations and ongoing projects. 
• Our waste management practices involve meticulous segregation of waste into categories such as general waste, 
scheduled waste and recyclable waste. To comply with regulations, we maintain sufficient storage capacity for 
waste and have installed dedicated Sewage Treatment Systems onboard each rig. These systems treat our sewage 
in accordance with best practices, ensuring no adverse environmental impacts upon discharge into the sea.
• In terms of water usage, our offshore operations primarily utilise seawater for rig activities, with the majority of 
seawater withdrawn for drilling and cleaning purposes. The remaining seawater undergoes filtration and distillation 
via reverse osmosis to ensure it meets potable standards for consumption by the crew. 
• Regarding effluents, we adhere to a strict zero discharge policy within our offshore operations to prevent pollution in the 
surrounding marine environment. Moreover, our rigs are equipped with spill containment systems certified by regulatory 
bodies like ABS and DNV, demonstrating our comprehensive approach to preventing direct environmental pollution.

Enhancing 
Competencies and 
Engagement
• To ensure our workforce and crew receive adequate trainings in managing scheduled wastes and maintain full 
compliance with legal requirements, a number of our employees undergo the Certified Environmental Professional 
in Scheduled Waste Management (“CePSWAM”) training. This training programme is offered by the Environment 
Institute of Malaysia (“EiMAS”) under the auspices of the DOE.
• We have also established a Waste Management Task Force to enhance waste management across our operations 
and implement improvements to our waste management framework. Additionally, we regularly update our clients 
on our performance and initiatives to ensure alignment with their guidelines and expectations.

In FY2023, we maintained our record of zero environmental non-compliance or major spills while 
further reducing water consumption intensity per operational day. Only one minor spill was recorded 
during the year. 
We remain vigilant to the environmental risks attributed to our increase operational activity, with 
higher rig utilisation over the past year contributing to 34% rise in our water consumption and 62% 
increase in scheduled waste generation. However, we have continued to ensure that none of our 
water requirements rely on water extracted from water stressed areas. 
While we view this a commendable performance, we recognise that more can be done.
Moving forward, we are committed to enhancing waste circularity through comprehensive assessments 
and a deeper understanding of our overall waste streams.

manner that preserves natural oceanic ecosystems, minimising and preventing any negative impacts on marine life and biodiversity resulting from our 
business activities. Furthermore, as responsible corporate citizens, we are committed to conservation efforts aimed at preserving nature and biodiversity. 
Through outreach initiatives and engagement with local communities, we strive to raise awareness and promote collective action towards this shared goal.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Stringent Guidelines 
to Ensure Responsible 
Operations
• To ensure effective governance and oversight on nature and biodiversity impacts, we have established a Marine 
Operations Policy that outlines the stringent measures our operational teams should adopt to safeguard the 
surrounding environment during our offshore operations. 
• This policy ensures that thorough due diligence is conducted before initiating new projects. This includes ensuring 
that projects are not undertaken in biodiverse areas and requiring clients to conduct comprehensive Environmental 
Impact Assessments (“EIAs”) to assess biodiversity risks at each site.
• Additionally, we collaborate closely with our clients to avoid areas with significant biodiversity value or habitats for 
rare and endangered species listed on the IUCN Red List.
Adopting Operational 
Controls to Prevent 
Impact
• Various practices have been adopted as standard operating procedures (“SOPs”) to ensure minimal impact on 
natural ecosystems during our offshore activities. A direct approach to preserving marine ecosystems is our utilising 
the seabed survey reports from client EIAs to strategically position our rigs to minimise interference with aquatic 
habitats, fish populations and migratory routes. Indirectly, our collective efforts to embed accident prevention, 
pollution avoidance and carbon footprint mitigation practices in our operations also contributes to a net positive 
impact towards safeguarding marine biodiversity.
• Additionally, we pay close attention to minimising environmental impact during decommissioning activities. This 
includes preventing potential oil spillages that could pollute marine environments, avoiding physical disturbance to 
the seabed and surrounding ecosystems, and mitigating the risk of introducing invasive or diseased species to new 
rig sites if marine organisms are still attached to the rig structure.
• All plug and abandonment projects are conducted in full compliance with local and international regulatory 
frameworks, including the ASCOPE Decommissioning Guidelines for Oil and Gas Facilities and the DOE 
Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines for Petroleum Industries.
Stakeholder 
and Community 
Engagement
• Through ongoing engagement with regulators, government agencies, and industry peers, we stay informed 
about regulatory changes and best practices to ensure that our drilling and decommissioning processes minimise 
biodiversity loss. 
• We also collaborate closely with our contractors to ensure that their practices meet robust environmental standards 
consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility.
• Simultaneously, we engage with the broader community to actively participate in biodiversity conservation projects. 
• Since FY2022, we have partnered with the Faculty of Science and Marine Environment of Universiti Malaysia 
Terengganu ("UMT") and Alunan Coral Project to support coral reef restoration efforts at Perhentian Island in 
Terengganu. Over the past two years, we have completed two phases of the programme, planting more than 500 
new coral fragments across two coral nurseries.
• In addition to our restoration efforts, we conduct educational activities to raise awareness of coral preservation 
among local populations, and have undertaken a survey of fish diversity to gain a deeper understanding of the 
surrounding aquatic communities.

OUR PERFORMANCE
Prior to every drilling campaign, we will review the EIA assessments conducted by the clients and 
reassessed our HSE case to ensure mitigation and control processes in place in avoiding potential 
damage to surrounding marine ecosystem. These were reviewed in reference to guideline from global 
and local frameworks like the International Union for Conservation of Nature ("IUCN") and DOE 
Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines for Petroleum Industries of which we found that none of 
our operational areas were adjacent to sites classified as rich in biodiversity.
Beyond operational control of our projects, Velesto continues to commit to conservation efforts in 
particular our coral restoration site in Pulau Perhentian. In FY2023, we spent a total of RM63,357 
on this initiative, a 41% increase compared to the year prior. In recent analysis of coral growth, we 
identified that four different species of the corals we planted in 2022 have already begun to grow, 
indicating that our efforts are on the right track. 
We have also advanced public awareness and awareness on our coral planting project, while 
adopting technology to increase accessibility to these corals. Through the use of virtual reality, we 
provide an opportunity for those who are unable to enter the ocean, such as young children, the 
elderly and the physically challenged, to obtain an immersive educational experience through remote 
learning.
Our commitment to supporting marine biodiversity drew industry recognition over the past year, with 
our coral nursery project being awarded the CSR Initiative of the Year for the Oil and Gas sector at 
the 2023 Malaysia Excellence Awards presented by Asian Business Review Magazine. As the only 
oil and gas company engaged in coral reef restoration in Perhentian Island, we are dedicated to 
continuing this conservation programme in the years ahead.

SAFETY & HEALTH
WHY IT MATTERS 
Ensuring the safety and health of our workforce is paramount at Velesto, particularly in terms of safeguarding employees from occupational hazards 
during offshore oil and gas operations. Our robust safety practices not only mitigate potential impacts to our operations but also drive speed, reliability, 
productivity and morale among employees. Maintaining a strong safety track record further enhances our reputation, protects our licenses and gives us 
a competitive edge in contract bids. We thus take all necessary precautions to protect employees and have inculcated safety awareness as an integral 
part of our business culture.

---- Page 87 ----
Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Stringent Leadership 
and Oversight
• To ensure effective leadership and oversight of all safety and health matters, we have established a dedicated 
corporate HSE Committee that is chaired by Velesto’s President, who serves as the Group’s primary advocate 
for all HSE matters. In discharging his duties, our President is further supported by the Board and the Senior  
Management team. 
• At the highest level, OSH matters are discussed during full Board meetings and quarterly meetings of the Board Risk 
Management Committee (“BRMC”). Our HSE Division and HSE Committees report to the Board Risk Management 
Committee, and are responsible for monitoring and enhancing overall HSE performance across our business 
operations. To ensure leadership personnel remain informed about relevant OSH issues and are able to monitor 
ongoing performance, the HSE Division conducts monthly HSE Operations Meetings, which are led by our Vice 
President of Operations and attended by Rig Managers, HSE Heads and HSE Managers. 
• The President and Senior Management team also participate in regular site visits to emphasise their commitment to 
employee safety and well-being, including those working offshore. These visits serve to foster a strong safety culture 
and boost employees' morale. In 2023, a total of 57 Management HSE visits were conducted, with our President 
attending 11 of these excursions.
OSH Policies and 
Scorecard KPIs
• To foster a safety-conscious culture, we have implemented a robust HSE Policy and an OSH Policy that meets 
all regulatory requirements, including the Malaysian Occupational Safety and Health Act. This is supported by 
a comprehensive OSH Management System that was developed in accordance with global best practices and 
certified to ISO 45001, ISO 14001 and ISO 29001 standards.
• To underscore our commitment to driving OSH excellence and establish clear performance expectations, KPIs 
related to safety and health have been incorporated into the scorecards of HSE leadership and management teams. 
We benchmark our safety performance against industry standards and internal performance targets, which include 
parameters such as achieving zero Lost Time Incidents (“LTI”).
Identifying and 
Mitigating OSH Risks
• We adopt a vigilant approach to identifying potential health and safety risks across our worksites and value chain, 
deploying the use of Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control (“HIRARC”) and taking into account a 
wide range of factors such as exposure to chemical health risks, noise pollution, near miss incidents and potential 
hazards, amongst others. 
• Prior to the commencement of projects or rig operations at a new site, we carry out OSH risk assessments to 
uncover risks unique to a particular location or task. Once risks are identified, HSE Heads and Managers play 
a key role in facilitating the analysis and evaluation of risks, along with proposing appropriate action plans and 
mitigation strategies to prevent potential incidents from occurring. Further to this, we may periodically reassess 
risks at existing operations as and when required, such as in the event of weather changes, process variations or 
occurrence of OSH incidents. 
• We also ensure that our HSE Committees comprise a mix of management and employee representatives. This 
diverse composition enables our leadership teams to better understand the challenges faced by on-ground crew 
members, facilitating continuous improvement in risk mitigation and precautionary practices. All significant OSH 
risks are thoroughly discussed and addressed in quarterly meetings of the HSE Committee.
Initiatives to Drive a 
Robust HSE Culture
• We prioritise employee safety and health through comprehensive measures, with preventative maintenance being 
a key strategy to prevent OSH incidents caused by equipment malfunction. We adopt industry recommended 
practices, alongside API and OEM guidelines, when conducting regular maintenance on our assets, and seek input 
from independent consultants and clients to ensure our equipment meets required standards. 
• Additionally, we conduct annual internal audits of our facilities and provide trainings for auditing staff to ensure 
a thorough understanding of safety standards and their application. Details of internal audits conducted during 
FY2023 are outlined in the accompanying table.

Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Implemented a Stop 
Work Policy
• Stop Work Policy to empower employees to halt work in the face of a potentially unsafe situation. This policy 
serves to enhance accountability amongst employees while enabling a prompt response to prevent escalation of 
potentially catastrophic OSH incidents. In 2023, a total of 33,000 Time Out For Safety (“TOFS”) stop-work orders 
were issued.
• In the event of HSE emergencies, we rely on our Emergency Control Centre (“ECC”) at Plaza Sentral and conduct 
regular mock simulations and drills to ensure preparedness for major disruptions. Weekly emergency drills are 
conducted on rigs, and annual fire drills are carried out at other facilities. 
• Additionally, we have developed an Emergency Response Plan (“ERP”) for all Velesto facilities and established an 
Emergency Response Team (“ERT”) to swiftly respond to incidents.
Leveraging Technology 
to Enhance Safety
• We allocate significant resources to maintain and enhance our practices and infrastructure, including investing in 
cutting-edge innovations such as the Synergi Life's QHSE software. 
• In 2023, we initiated the implementation of the Synergi Life ESG module to further strengthen our capabilities in 
managing ESG-related data.
• To improve our incident investigation capabilities, we have implemented an Investigation Management System 
Procedure that utilises incident investigation software such as Tripod Beta and Systematic Cost Analysis Technique. 
These tools provide detailed insights into incidents, enabling our investigation team to identify causation paths and 
weaknesses in current safety measures, propelling the development of improvement plans.
Driving HSE 
Engagement Amongst 
Employees
• To enhance safety and health awareness among our workforce, we utilise various communication platforms such 
as briefing sessions, HSE meetings, posters, notice boards, bulletins, emails, memos and videos to disseminate 
information about our OSH Policies, standards and practices. 
• Additionally, our HSE training programme offers a wide range of industry-specific trainings to equip employees 
with the necessary competencies for safe and effective job performance, with the following topics covered during 
FY2023.
Employee 
Representation on HSE 
Committees
• In our belief that employees should play a meaningful role in OSH management, we have established a HSE 
Committee that comprises a mix of management and employee representatives from both the Operations and 
Corporate Divisions.
• Through these quarterly HSE Committee meetings, we empower employees to contribute directly to their working 
conditions and leverage the informed insights and suggestions of frontline workers who face the most significant 
OSH risks. This two-way engagement enables employees to take ownership of their work environment, and 
promotes a culture of accountability and compliance guided by established systems, processes and procedures.
• In addressing any HSE issues raised by employees, the HSE Committee is sanctioned to proactively determine and 
implement the necessary measures to uphold safety and security across our working sites.
• We are pleased to have retained 100% employee representation on our HSE Committee during FY2023.
In 2023, our President attended

FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
WHY IT MATTERS 
Recognising the pivotal role of our people in our success and sustainability, we prioritise providing them with a supportive and engaging environment 
to unleash their full potential. Through learning programmes, career development pathways, competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and 
wellbeing initiatives, we empower our workforce to grow alongside the organisation and cultivate a culture of excellence and innovation. These initiatives 
also enhance our ability to attract and retain top industry talent, crucial for achieving our overarching ambitions.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Robust Governance and 
Policies
• The Board of Directors through BNRC assumes a fundamental role in overseeing our talent retention and development 
strategies, ensuring that our human resources policies align with our business objectives and monitoring Key Performance 
Indicators ("KPIs") relating to employee engagement, retention and development.
 • To support the Board in these efforts, we established the Velesto Talent Council (“VTC”) in FY2021, through which Senior 
Management personnel collaborate with Group Human Resources Division to set overarching goals and strategies for 
addressing talent gaps and challenges within the organisation.
• Evaluation of our talent management framework centres on metrics such as employee productivity and business performance. 
Monthly reports on employment data covering areas like hiring, attrition, trainings and diversity indicators serve as key 
insights for refining our talent management strategies.
• To ensure Group-wide adherence to fair employment practices, we have established various overarching Group policies, 
most notably our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“CoBE”), Policy Statement on Human Rights and Labour Standards, 
and our Policy Statement on Recruitment Management System Procedures.
Recruitment and 
Onboarding Practices
• We maintain fair and non-discriminatory practices throughout our recruitment process, with the exception of prioritising 
local candidates for job vacancies if they meet the necessary requirements. 
• Successful hires receive detailed contracts outlining their roles, responsibilities and remuneration, promoting transparency 
and fairness.
• New hires undergo a thorough induction process covering their rights and entitlements as per local laws and Group 
policies, including those related to human rights, corruption and ethical conduct. 
• Additionally, compulsory HSE induction sessions acquaint all new employees with safety protocols and procedures. This 
comprehensive induction procedure aids new hires in adapting to our organisational processes, communication channels 
and corporate culture, facilitating their adjustment to the work environment and ensuring a positive experience at Velesto.
Competitive 
Remuneration and 
Benefits
• To foster a high-performance culture, we implement merit-based compensation systems evaluated against individual, team 
and Group KPIs, alongside considerations of seniority and qualifications. 
• Regular assessments ensure the competitiveness of our compensation and benefits packages in line with industry standards, 
with adjustments made as needed subject to financial feasibility.
• We offer a wide array of benefits to full-time employees, encompassing both mandatory benefits as stipulated by Malaysia's 
Employment Act 1955 and additional perks provided at the Company's discretion. These supplementary benefits are 
strategically offered to uphold our ability to attract and retain top industry talent.
• ESOS options were granted to eligible employees.
Example of benefits offered to our employees are outlined in the section below.
Training, Development 
and Appraisals
• We invest significantly in employee training to equip our staff with the essential knowledge and skills that align with our 
long-term aspirations. Courses and programmes are predominantly delivered through various electronic communication 
platforms, and are customised to address individual requirements. 
• During the annual appraisal process, we assess competency gaps and collaboratively devise a comprehensive personal 
development plan for each employee with input from Human Resources, the individual and their supervisors. Subsequently, 
we establish training KPIs for employees to fulfil before their next annual appraisals.
• Our appraisal process is constructive and two-way, empowering employees to provide insights on their performance or 
challenge results through our formal grievance mechanism. This feedback loop also helps evaluate the effectiveness of our 
training programmes, with feedback solicited from employees through Training Evaluation Forms and utilised to pinpoint 
areas for enhancement and ensure our training initiatives meet the evolving needs of our workforce.

Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Robust Employee 
Engagement 
• Valuing transparent and timely communication with our staff, we maintain regular engagement through both physical 
and virtual channels. A new initiative launched in FY2023 was the 'Learning Over Lunch with President' programme, 
which leverages direct interaction with leadership to motivate and inspire our workforce, while fostering transparency and 
building rapport.
• Additionally, quarterly town hall meetings remain a cornerstone of our communication strategy, providing a platform for 
Senior Management to engage with all employees. We have also continued to embrace new digital tools to enhance 
employee engagement, with our Velesto Inspires Me ("VIME") digital magazine covering topics such as self-management, 
culture and sustainability to educate employees and provide them with a central space to connect and engage.
• As part of our commitment to employee engagement, we conduct a biennial Employee Engagement Survey, achieving a 
score of 79% in our last survey. In response to feedback from previous surveys, we have implemented initiatives to address 
key issues and enhance employees' satisfaction. 
• Moreover, we continually implement a variety of initiatives and incentives to demonstrate appreciation for our employees' 
dedication, while rewarding top performers for their invaluable contributions to our success.
Adopting Two-Way 
Evaluations
• Our formal appraisal practices for all employees are pivotal for identifying individual training needs and determining 
annual compensation packages, which include staff bonuses. Designed to be a constructive, two-way process, our 
performance-driven approach to appraisals enables employees to provide their own insights on their performance. 
• Employees retain the right to accept or contest their appraisal results, and those who disagree with their review scores can 
address their grievances with HR through our formal employee grievance mechanism.
• At the same time, we gauge the effectiveness of each training programme by soliciting feedback from employees through 
Training Evaluation Forms distributed at the conclusion of each session. These forms assess various facets of the training, 
such as employee satisfaction, attainment of learning objectives and the ability to apply newfound knowledge and skills 
to their role. By systematically evaluating the efficacy of our training programmes, we can pinpoint areas for enhancement 
and ensure that our training initiatives meet the evolving needs of our workforce.
Other Internship 
and Development 
Programmes
• We remain committed to enhancing youth employability through our Velesto Trainee Scheme (“VTS”) and internship 
programmes, which offer selected graduates 12-month appointments to gain practical experience. 
• These initiatives are particularly beneficial for unemployed youths, especially local undergraduates, providing them 
with valuable exposure to their chosen fields of study and bolstering their future employability, directly supporting the 
government's efforts to enhance the job prospects of unemployed graduates in Malaysia.
• Participants in the VTS who demonstrate promise and aptitude may be offered full-time employment opportunities with 
Velesto, further underscoring our commitment to nurturing talent and investing in our workforce. 
• The VTS programme also serves as a cornerstone of our Community Investment initiatives, reflecting our dedication to 
promoting youth employment and supporting local communities. As part of our Velesto Wawasan 2030 initiative, we have 
extended the reach of the VTS to Sarawak, thereby expanding business functions and creating job opportunities for B40 
Malaysians in the region.
• Additionally, we have initiated an Offshore Development Programme encompassing the Velesto Drilling Engineer (“VDE”) 
and Velesto Electronic Engineer (“VEE”) programmes. These initiatives are designed to cultivate local talent within the oil 
and gas industry, focusing on equipping young graduates with the technical expertise and skills required for success. By 
providing hands-on experience and comprehensive trainings, these programmes prepare participants to excel in various 
aspects of the industry, thus contributing to their professional development and the growth of the sector as a whole.
Velesto provides competitive leave entitlement in compliance with relevant labor regulations and corporate best practices.

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS
WHY IT MATTERS 
Responsible protection of human rights is crucial, not just from an ethical standpoint but also to ensure the sustainability of our business operations. By 
upholding ethical labour practices internally and throughout our supply chain, we ensure compliance with regulations and create workplaces where 
employees are valued, respected and empowered. This is essential for safeguarding our business interests and maintaining stakeholder trust and 
confidence in Velesto.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Our Policies and 
Commitments
• Our human rights commitments are overseen by the Board and embedded within various overarching Group 
policies, which were crafted in alignment with relevant Malaysian labour laws, including the Malaysian Employment 
Act 1955 and Minimum Wages Act, as well as other applicable laws in the regions where we operate.  
• In addition to our CoBE and Policy Statement on Human Rights and Labour Standards, we have implemented 
a Policy Statement on Recruitment Management System Procedure to provide controls for due diligence when 
engaging suppliers and vendors. 
Our Practices and 
Processes
• We have established numerous business practices and processes that underscore our respect for our employee 
rights. These include practicing flexible working hours and fatigue management to prevent excessive work hours, 
providing fair warning of operational and policy changes, offering wages that exceed minimum wage requirements, 
and implementing formal and confidential grievance channels. 
• Our practices are further supported by the guidelines and stipulations of other related policies, such as those 
pertaining to non-discrimination, diversity and the creation of an equal opportunity workplace (see Diversity and 
Inclusion on page 95-97). We are continually reviewing our approach and practices to ensure relevance and 
ongoing compliance amidst an evolving operational landscape.
Supply Chain Due 
Diligence 
• Velesto is deeply committed to upholding human rights across our operations and supply chain, leaving no room 
for violations. Our procurement, contract and human resources teams lead the charge in collectively managing the 
day-to-day responsibilities of preventing and monitoring human rights risks within our Group.
• We expect all suppliers and vendors, including those employed by third-party contractors, to ensure their workforce 
is treated with dignity and operates in safe conditions. They are required to affirm their compliance with Malaysian 
laws on human and labour rights, worker welfare, child labour and human trafficking. Failure to affirm their 
compliance or meet these standards would result in serious consequences, including termination of services and 
legal action.
• Our proactive stance on this matter includes continuous assessment of labour risk issues and human rights impacts 
as part of our core business processes, with quick action undertaken to prevent and address any suspected or 
identified instances of exploitation or forced labour.
Employee Engagement 
and Feedback 
Channels
• The Group periodically undertakes educational campaigns to drive compliance to our policies, with one such 
example being anti-sexual harassment roadshows to create greater awareness of our Policy on Sexual Harassment.
• We have also established communication channels to empower our employees and stakeholders to be the eyes 
and ears of leadership teams in overseeing human rights matters. Both internal and external stakeholders can utilise 
feedback mechanisms outlined within our Whistle-Blowing Policy and Grievance Procedures to raise grievances 
and issues pertaining to misconduct, harassment, human rights exploitation or other incidents of non-compliance. 
• Individuals may raise these concerns anonymously and without fear of retaliation, either directly to their managers 
and human resources representatives, or through our confidential whistle-blowing channel, which is made accessible 
within our internal NEST network for internal stakeholders and our corporate website for external stakeholders. All 
grievances and concerns raised are investigated promptly by relevant management and leadership teams, ensuring 
timely remediation for affected parties and taking appropriate action to prevent recurrences.

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
DIVERSITY , EQUITY & INCLUSION
WHY IT MATTERS 
Velesto remains committed to promoting diversity, equal opportunity and meritocracy throughout the Group, fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity 
among our employees. Embracing diversity enriches our workforce by bringing together a range of expertise, experiences and perspectives, which in turn 
fuels innovative thinking, enhances our decision-making processes. Moreover, by instilling a culture driven by merit-based achievements, we enhance our 
ability to attract and retain top performing talents.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Guiding Policies and 
Oversight
• The Human Resources Department takes a leading and proactive role in championing diversity and inclusion 
initiatives throughout the Group, guided in their approach by the various policies the Group has established to 
facilitate the implementation of inclusive practices. 
• Alongside our Policy Statement on Human Rights and Labour Standards, we have also instituted a Gender Equality 
Policy Statement, Disciplinary Procedures and Policy on Consequence Management that outline our expectations 
from employees and management personnel. Through these policies and measures, we unequivocally prohibit any 
form of discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, religion or socio-cultural background.
• To ensure ongoing oversight and drive continuous improvement, we have integrated diversity and inclusion Key 
Performance Indicators ("KPIs") into the scorecards of our leaders and managers, encouraging consistency and 
enhancement of our practices across the Group. 
Upholding a Fair and 
Inclusive Culture
• All employees and candidates for employment, promotion and development are assessed based on merit, including 
their qualifications, experience and professional contributions. The sole exception to this merit-based approach is 
our preference for hiring local talent, as part of our commitment to supporting local communities and safeguarding 
business sustainability.
• Recognising the rich tapestry of backgrounds within our workforce, we strive to accommodate and respect 
their individual dispositions, which can significantly enhance their experience and behaviour in the workplace. 
To this end, employees are encouraged to freely practice their respective cultures and religions without fear of 
discrimination or harassment. 
• Through regular employee engagement activities, we further facilitate the cultivation of shared values and mutual 
respect, fostering a positive and respectful workplace culture that values diversity and inclusivity.
Gender Equality • Through our Gender Equality Policy, we have formalised our commitment to offering equal opportunities for both 
male and female employees to access employment benefits and participate at all levels of the company. We actively 
work to overcome gender-related barriers, creating an inclusive environment that welcomes women interested in 
pursuing careers at Velesto, even in traditionally male-dominated technical, offshore or field-related roles. 
• Our efforts have resulted in a significant presence of talented women within our organisation, particularly in 
executive and leadership positions. As of December 2023, women constitute 51% of executive employees and 
44% of the directors serving on our Board, surpassing the BURSA target of 30% women directorship in public listed 
companies.
Parental Leave 
Entitlement
• We understand that welcoming a new addition to the family is a significant milestone, and we support our 
employees through this transition by providing ample time for parental leave. As of 2023, our parental leave 
entitlement stands at 98 days for new mothers and 7 days for new fathers, in adherence to regulatory standards. 
• By offering opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take time off to care for their newborn, we aim to promote 
gender equality, encourage shared parenting responsibilities and ultimately create a more inclusive and supportive 
workplace culture.

Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Promoting Greater 
Inclusiveness
• While our recruitment strategy prioritises meritocracy, we acknowledge the importance of empowering 
underrepresented and vulnerable groups to enlist in our workforce. These groups encompass minorities, persons 
with disabilities, asylum seekers and refugees, long-term unemployed individuals, and those facing socioeconomic 
disadvantages. 
• To address this, we conduct targeted recruitment drives aimed at candidates from the B40 Income Group to fill 
available positions. Additionally, we have introduced a new diversity indicator to monitor the representation of staff 
with disabilities across the Group.
Engagement and 
Advocation
• Our diversity and inclusion principles are communicated during employee onboarding and reinforced through 
engagement sessions and notices, ensuring the objectives of our policies are understood and employees are 
made aware of our Whistle-Blowing Policy and Grievance Procedures, which provides guidelines for reporting 
any instances of harassment. Additionally, we provide training to managers to raise awareness of the importance 
of gender equality in driving the success of our organisation. In our continuous efforts to enhance our culture and 
practices, we leverage on insights gained through periodic employee surveys and focus group discussions to 
identify and address gaps.
• Furthermore, we actively promote gender diversity in leadership roles through our involvement in the Malaysian 
Chapter of the 30% Club. This advocacy group focuses on increasing the representation of women in the boards 
and Senior Management of publicly listed companies. Our management actively participates in various initiatives 
led by the 30% Club, underscoring our commitment to fostering greater diversity and inclusivity within Corporate 
Malaysia and the oil and gas sector. 
OUR PERFORMANCE
In accordance with our commitments and stakeholder expectations, Velesto has maintained a healthy representation of both men and women in our 
workforce, highlighted by our Board comprising of 44% women directors. We have also maintained a favourable mix of gender and age groups within 
our executive and managerial teams. The Group will continue to assess and analyse our policies, procedures and practices to ensure our commitments in 
this regard are upheld and enhanced where possible.

COMMUNITY IMPACT
WHY IT MATTERS
As a responsible corporate entity, we acknowledge our duty to share the value we create with local communities and leave a lasting positive impact. 
Through activities related to our business and industry sector, alongside targeted outreach programmes, we aim to actively contribute towards economic 
growth and social progress. We also leverage on partnerships with NGOs and industry peers to deliver initiatives that support underprivileged individuals 
while simultaneously supporting progress within the local oil and gas fraternity.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Holistically Delivering 
Community Benefits
• Our commitment to positive community impact is led by our Sustainability and Corporate Communications 
department which oversees the organisation of various initiatives and programmes that benefit local communities. 
To ensure coherence and purpose in our actions, we have identified the four pillars of ‘Education’, ‘Environment’, 
‘Community Safety’ and ‘Community Uplift’ to guide our efforts.
• We also leverage our business operations and presence in the oil and gas sector to offer vocational support and 
drive socio-economic growth in our operational regions. In both East and West Malaysia, we take pride in fostering 
business growth and employment opportunities through our prioritisation of local candidates for job vacancies 
and when sourcing contractors and vendors for goods and services (read more in 'Supply Chain' topic on  
page 106-109).
• Additionally, through initiatives like the Velesto Drilling Academy (“VDA”), Velesto Trainee Scheme (“VTS”) and other 
development programmes, we actively contribute to the development of local infrastructure and the nurturing of 
talents within the oil and gas sector.
Community 
Engagement and 
Outreach
• During 2023, we continued to engage with and support local communities through targeted programmes delivered 
to communities surrounding our operational jurisdictions. 
• We actively encourage our employees to participate in these social initiatives, considering employee volunteerism 
time spent as a significant measure of both employee and community engagement. In FY2023, our employees 
collectively volunteered 256 hours for community engagement and outreach programmes, exemplifying the Group’s 
collective commitment to making a positive impact beyond our business operations.
Social Economic 
and Human Capital 
Development
• Through our VTS and internship programmes, we offer local graduates and unemployed youth 12-month appointments 
to gain practical experience within our organisation. By providing them with valuable industry exposure that bolsters 
their future employability, we directly support the government's efforts to enhance the job prospects of unemployed 
graduates in Malaysia. As part of our Velesto Wawasan 2030 initiative, we have extended the reach of the VTS 
to Sarawak, thereby expanding business functions and creating job opportunities for B40 Malaysians in the region.
Velesto Drilling 
Academy ("VDA")
• VDA not only offers courses to our internal staff for skill enhancement but also extends its offerings to external 
students from other companies including educational institutions like Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS ("UTP") and 
Institut Teknologi Petroleum PETRONAS ("INSTEP"). This industry-led initiative has successfully contributed to talent 
development in the oil and gas drilling sector, aligning with national goals for cultivating a highly skilled workforce.
• VDA collaborates with INSTEP through the Velesto-INSTEP Drilling Academy ("VIDA"), which operates a land rig 
facility at the Batu Rakit, Terengganu campus, offering practical, hands-on training opportunities. VDA also has 
collaboration agreement with UTP to assist practical and industrial exposure to relevant students of UTP.
• We also have initiated the involvement of internal Subject Matter Experts from within the Group to deliver training 
at VDA, leveraging our experience to address prevalent gaps within the industry and enhancing the overall quality 
of education provided to industry talents.

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
The following are highlights from our community engagement and outreach initiatives undertaken during the year:
Coral Planting at Perhentian Island, 
Terengganu
Our Coral Restoration Program has successfully 
brought together our employees and community 
members to plant over 500 corals at Perhentian 
Island, while also undertaking awareness and 
education efforts to instil greater responsibility in 
preserving marine life. This initiative was recognised 
as the CSR Initiative of the Year for Oil & Gas at the 
2023 Malaysia Management Excellence Awards.
Sahabat Maritim sponsorship
This collaborative effort, undertaken together with 
PETRONAS and the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement 
Agency – Kelantan (“MMEA”) since 2015, aims to 
benefit the Kelantan fishing communities near our 
operational zones, in areas such as Kuala Besar, Tok 
Bali and Tumpat. The program increases awareness 
of safety at sea and mitigates unauthorised access to 
restricted areas, including drilling rigs and oil fields.
Supporting Miri Education
In a continuation of last year’s initiative to enhance 
educational access and equality in rural Sarawakian 
communities, we provided essential resources and 
modern teaching tools such as laptops and Smart 
TVs to two institutions categorised as ‘Sekolah Kurang 
Murid’ or ‘Schools with Less Students’. Through our 
support, we have enhanced the learning experience 
for students at SK Sungai Biar and SK Sungai Kelabit 
in Miri, Sarawak.
OUR PERFORMANCE
Over the past year, the Group invested a total of RM95,000 (FY2022) and RM55,000 (FY2023) on community programmes. Moving forward, we 
will continue to seek opportunities for meaningful community investment. In this regard, we look forward to delivering positive outcomes from our recently 
signed MOU with the Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (“SEDC”). Via this collaboration, we aim to promote education as a core driver of 
sustainable development in Sarawak, specifically through innovative learning initiatives within the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math 
(“STEM”).

ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
WHY IT MATTERS 
As a publicly listed entity, we acknowledge our responsibility to generate returns for shareholders while also ensuring that the value we create is shared 
among our diverse stakeholder groups. By fulfilling these commitments, we cultivate trust and loyalty among shareholders, regulatory bodies, our workforce, 
and our partners. This positions the Group favourably to nurture and expand these relationships, thereby enhancing the long-term prospects of our business.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Embedding Economic 
Goals in our Guiding 
Frameworks
• Our commitment to consistently increase the economic value we generate is deeply ingrained in both our business 
and sustainability objectives. Through this commitment, we inspire collective effort across the Group towards 
a common goal of achieving RM2 billion in revenue and a ROCE above 10% by 2030, all while upholding 
sustainability and responsibility.
• Guided by a robust governance structure and comprehensive risk management practices, we consider all pertinent 
factors when formulating our operational and growth strategies to ensure stability and maintain a strong financial 
position (for more details, refer to 'Sustainability Governance' on page 59-61). In doing so, we strike a balanced 
approach between meeting our fiduciary obligations, including loan repayments and providing returns on 
shareholders' equity, and retaining sufficient funds to sustain and expand the business over the long-term.

Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future

Socio-Economic 
Contributions
• At the fundamental level, we are committed to contributing to socio-economic development in our regions of 
operations, through the taxes we pay, the salaries and benefits provided to employees, and returns we provide our 
shareholders and investors. 
• In addition to these contributions, we actively engage in community development projects and support local 
businesses, thereby fostering economic growth and sustainability in the regions where we operate. Furthermore, 
our commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable practices contributes to the preservation of natural 
resources that supports the livelihoods of surrounding communities.
Driving Quality and 
Customer Satisfaction
• Acknowledging quality and customer satisfaction as cornerstones of our sustainable value creation, we have 
instituted robust policies to maintain quality standards and ensure customer contentment while mitigating potential 
negative impacts. These policies, encompassing our Quality Policy, HSE Policy, Human Rights and Labor Standards 
Policy, are bolstered by our ISO9001:2015 and ISO 29001:2020 certifications, affirming our adherence to 
global benchmarks.
• Our collaborative approach to quality control involves close monitoring of adherence to standards, policies and key 
performance indicators, while facilitating continuous improvement through feedback mechanisms and leveraging 
technological advancements to enhance processes. Proactive risk management strategies, including contingency 
planning, further reinforce our commitment to delivering high-quality services while minimising adverse effects.
• KPIs have been integrated into the scorecards of the Operations Division, which oversees customer satisfaction 
efforts. Regular customer surveys are conducted via forms disseminated to customers, gathering vital feedback to 
gain insights on our ongoing performance. 
OUR PERFORMANCE
Despite facing operational challenges, we have preserved in generating significant economic value for our business and stakeholders. More details on 
our financial performance can be refer to Financial Statements section on page 192-210 and ESG Performance Table on page 119-128.

GOVERNANCE & ETHICS
WHY IT MATTERS 
A robust corporate governance framework and stringent ethical standards are important for cultivating stakeholder trust and safeguarding our business 
interests. These principles not only ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations but also nurture a culture of fairness, integrity and accountability 
throughout the organisation. Consequently, this bolsters our attractiveness to customers and investors, establishing a solid foundation for long-term 
sustainable value generation. 
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Stringent Board 
and Management 
Oversight 
• Our Board and Senior Management sets the tone for good corporate governance and ethical conduct by leading 
by example. To maintain vigilance and proactivity in these areas, the Board has established the Board Whistle-
Blowing Committee (“BWBC”) and the independent Integrity Governance Unit & Compliance (“IGUC”). In addition 
to taking ownership of whistle-blowing matters, the BWBC is responsible for overseeing the IGUC, which is tasked 
with managing and reporting on all matters related to anti-corruption, bribery and ethical behaviour. 
• The IGUC operates under the administrative oversight of the President’s Office and possesses the authority to directly 
report any suspected or actual incidents of corruption or corporate misconduct to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission (“MACC”). To ensure accountability and effectiveness for its members in promoting integrity and 
compliance within the organisation, KPIs for IGUC members are regularly evaluated based on agreed plans and 
initiatives. 
• The Board periodically reviews our internal policies to ensure they remain updated with evolving regulatory 
requirements and is responsible for deliberating whistle-blowing reports that have been reviewed by the BWBC to 
ensure that they are thoroughly investigated and addressed. 
Enterprise Risk 
Management and 
Business Continuity 
Management
• Velesto's ERM Framework, which provides a structured and systematic approach to risk management, plays a 
crucial role in the Group’s value-creation efforts. It incorporates consistent assessment methodologies and standards 
across the Group’s processes and operations, ensuring comprehensive identification, evaluation, mitigation, and 
monitoring of both inherent and emerging risks.
• Velesto’s commitment to maintaining operational readiness in the face of evolving risks forms the basis of its BCM 
initiatives, conducted throughout each financial year. The Group’s BCM Framework is a comprehensive approach 
that empowers Management to pinpoint potential threats and assess their impact on business operations, thereby 
crafting a robust strategy to mitigate these risks. This ensures the Group’s resilience, safeguarding stakeholder 
interests, brand equity, and reputation.
For more details, please refer to please refer to the SORMIC section of our Integrated Annual Report on page 174-184.
Policies and Procedures 
to Uphold Integrity
• In addition to leveraging our CoBE to ensure responsible business conduct (see ‘Fair Employment Practices’ on 
page 89 and ‘Protecting Human Rights’ on page 93 for more), the Group has established an Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”) to reinforce a zero-tolerance approach towards bribery and corruption across 
all business operations. Developed in alignment with Section 17A of the MACC Act, this policy prohibits corrupt 
practices within the organisation and in dealings with external parties, including all activities undertaken by the 
Board, Management and staff. 
• The Policy covers various forms of bribery and corruption, such as unofficial payments, gifts, entertainment, political 
contributions, gratifications and charitable support, while outlining clear punitive measures for individuals found 
engaging in corrupt acts, ranging from fines, suspensions, dismissal and reporting to enforcement authorities. To 
ensure transparency and accessibility, the ABC Policy has been published on the company's website, allowing 
stakeholders to easily access and understand the organisation's stance on bribery and corruption.

VALUE CREATION

---- Page 105 ----
Section 04  •  Embracing a Sustainable Future
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Assessment of 
Corruption Risks
• We conduct quarterly assessments to pinpoint corruption risks within specific departments or units, employing an 
approved risk rating matrix that evaluates the likelihood and impact of each risk, categorising them into varying 
levels such as extreme, high, medium and low. The results of these assessments undergo quarterly review by the 
IGUC and are presented to the BWBC. 
• Any identified or potential risks are closely monitored and addressed through the implementation of Risk Action 
Plans (“RAPs”) by the IGUC. Areas of our operations deemed at the highest risk of corruption are identified based 
on the potential for collusion with third parties, notably through the giving or receiving of bribes that impacts the 
impartiality of the tender process. 
Safeguards to Promote 
Anti-Corruption, 
Transparency and 
Regulatory Compliance
• In alignment with the Group’s ABC Policy and risk assessment protocols, we implement several measures to deter 
corrupt practices and ensure compliance within our organisation and supply chain. 
• The Boards and management team reaffirmed their commitment to integrity by taking and signing the Corruption 
Free Pledge, witnessed by MACC in FY2023.
• A Tender Committee has been established, with approval power limits set according to hierarchical authority levels. 
Additionally, we utilise our Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system to enhance transparency throughout the tender 
process. To reinforce ethical conduct, awareness sessions and regular reminders are conducted, accompanied by 
mandatory ABC training for all employees.
• Furthermore, our Commercial Division has implemented a Know Your Counterpart (“KYC”) process to bolster 
understanding of third-party entities. Anti-corruption clauses are clearly outlined in our Supplier CoBE and integrated 
into purchase orders and contracts, while being further emphasised during vendor awareness programmes. 
• Should our employees or third parties’ suspect incidents of non-compliance, they are encouraged to file confidential 
reports as per the mechanisms provided within our Whistle-Blowing Policy. Developed in accordance with Section 
7(1)(c) of the Whistle Blowers Protection Act 2010, the policy enables internal or external stakeholders to submit 
reports directly to the Head of the IGUC, where they are initially investigated before being escalated to the BWBC 
for further review and deliberation by an investigation team. If substantiated, appropriate actions are taken against 
the implicated party, ranging from warnings and dismissals to contract termination, or reporting to enforcement 
authorities such as the MACC or the police.
• As part of our commitment to regulatory compliance, we ensure timely publication of our financial performance, 
corporate announcements and governance-related disclosures on our website, meeting listing requirements and 
fostering transparency. Moreover, we uphold principles of fair competition and refrain from engaging in any anti-
competitive practices, with our policies prohibiting collusion, price-fixing, bid coordination, or any actions that 
restrict market access. 
• We have also consistently maintained a strict apolitical stance, barring any association with or endorsement for any 
political parties or organisations. We firmly abstain from making donations to political parties, but may engage in 
events organised by the government or its agencies as part of charitable initiatives or nation-building efforts.

Integrity Assessment for all 
Onshore Staff
• Conducted assessments to gauge the level of understanding regarding integrity practices including conflict 
of interest and heightened awareness regarding governance and corruption-related matters.
Regulatory Compliance and Political Disassociation
We recognise the critical importance of regulatory compliance to the sustainability of our operations, 
understanding that adherence to regulations is fundamental to maintaining our license to operate. 
Compliance issues, including corruption, pollution, modern slavery, and data privacy, among 
others, could jeopardise our ability to operate sustainably. As part of our commitment, we ensure 
timely publication of our financial performance, corporate announcements, and governance-related 
disclosures on our website, meeting listing requirements and fostering transparency.
Moreover, we uphold principles of fair competition and refrain from engaging in any anti-competitive 
practices or abusing our market position. Our strict policies prohibit collusion, price-fixing, bid 
coordination, or any actions that restrict market access. Continuously monitoring changes in the 
regulatory landscape forms part of our Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control framework, 
ensuring ongoing compliance with applicable laws and industry regulation. 
We have also consistently maintained a strict 
apolitical stance, barring any association with 
or endorsement for any political parties or 
organisations. Our firm policy prohibits making 
donations to political parties. However, we may 
engage in events organised by the government 
or its agencies as part of charitable initiatives or

SUPPLY CHAIN
WHY IT MATTERS 
Ensuring the sustainability and responsibility of our operations rely heavily on effective supply chain management and oversight. By preserving our 
organisation's values and principles across the supply chain, we protect our business stability and mitigate the risks of inefficiencies or irresponsible 
practices. Additionally, we prioritise the engagement of local suppliers to improve the long-term sustainability of our industry, while actively engaging with 
entities in our supply chain to deepen relationships and bolster their competence, compliance and sustainability performance.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Ensuring Compliance 
and Enhancing 
Oversight
• Our foremost priority is ensuring adherence to our policies across the supply chain, with clauses embedded in our 
tender and contract documents mandating vendors' compliance with our supplier CoBE, ABC Policy and other 
relevant policies concerning environmental and social practices. Failure to comply may lead to service termination 
or regulatory reporting. We afford suppliers falling short of desired quality scores sufficient time to address any 
deficiencies; however, failure to rectify them may result in removal from our vendor procurement list. Notably, in 
FY2023, no supplier terminations were reported for non-compliance.
• Vendor assessments are a a crucial aspect of our efforts to bolster oversight over our supply chain, with evaluations 
regularly conducted on our vendors' policies and practices concerning corruption, occupational health and safety, 
human rights, environmental performance and labour rights. In 2023, we identified a total of 33 companies for the 
Critical Supplier Audit exercise.
• We also maintain vigilant oversight of our internal supply management practices, highlighted in 2023 by a 
comprehensive Velesto Assurance Review (“VAR”) undertaken for all vendor management teams across all divisions 
and departments. Through these VARs, we are enabled to strengthen our internal practices, ensuring the activities 
carried out within each division or department comply with relevant policies and procedures.
Responsible 
Procurement 
• Our commitment to responsible procurement is facilitated through our vendor procurement guidelines and ERP 
systems. Through these transparent processes, we ensure equal opportunities for all qualified vendors and are 
empowered to award contracts based on merit, considering factors such as cost, quality, regulatory compliance 
and OSH track record.
• Aligned with our Local First policy, we prioritise local suppliers for goods and services, unless local options are 
unavailable or do not meet our requirements for price, functionality and quality. As part of our commitment to 
bolstering local supply chains, we are an anchor partner of the PETRONAS Vendor Development Programme 
("VDPx"). Through VDPx, we focus on developing local suppliers in key areas such as Topside Medic Support 
Services, Logistics & Forwarding Services, Offshore Catering Services, and Offshore Manpower Services, aligning 
with our business requirements and supporting the growth of the local industry.
Promoting 
Sustainability Across 
our Value Chain
We aim to extend our sustainability goals and values across our supply chain in order to have a greater impact on 
the environment and society. To be eligible for contract bidding with Velesto, suppliers must adhere to certain general 
principles.
Supply Chain 
Engagement
In pursuit of our rigorous supply management objectives, we engage in numerous initiatives with our pool of vendors 
each year, strengthening these relationships and developing more robust collaborations. These events and engagements 
also provide a platform for providing updates on our policies or practices, and clarifying concerns and expectations 
with our partners.

packages. 
Respect for diversity
Suppliers are to adopt formal or informal non-discriminatory practices based on age, gender, 
language, marital status, religion, union affiliation, race, colour, ethnic or national origin, family 
status, disability or other distinguishing characteristics. 
Respect for health and 
safety
Employees of our suppliers are to be provided with safe working conditions that do not impact 
their health. Where the job or work area presents health and safety risks, workers must at all 
times be provided with the necessary training, equipment and safeguards. Suppliers must adopt 
a recognised HSE system and strive for zero loss of life.
Respect for the 
environment Suppliers must remain committed to protecting the environment and preventing pollution.

DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY
WHY IT MATTERS 
In an advancing digital age, the significance of data privacy and cybersecurity is escalating. Protecting our systems and databases containing sensitive 
information from potential cyber threats and privacy breaches is essential for maintaining the stability of our business. At the same time, it ensures our 
adherence to evolving regulations like data protection laws and mitigates legal and reputational risks, while fostering trust among stakeholders
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Ensuring Compliance 
and Access Controls
• Our commitment to ensure data privacy and security across the organisation is overseen by IT Operations department. 
Our primary objective is to ensure full and complete compliance with all relevant regulations applicable to our 
business most notably towards upholding the standards outlined in the Personal Data Protection Act ("PDPA"). To 
this end, we have appointed a dedicated data protection officer from the IGUC to implement best practices for 
handling personal data securely.
• In addition to compliance with the PDPA, we employ a robust array of ICT-based systems to safeguard the storage 
of data. This includes the implementation of firewalls and other protective measures to prioritise data integrity and 
confidentiality. Access to data is strictly controlled with restricted levels of access, and all file transfers are encrypted 
to ensure maximum security.
Enhancing Email 
Security
• In 2023, a core focus of our ongoing efforts was to bolster our security posture against both external and internal 
threats, notably within our Group email solution. During the year, we deployed a new email gateway that effectively 
filters all incoming data, ensuring that it is legitimate and free from any malicious intent.
• Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive analysis across crucial security facets, encompassing spam 
prevention, phishing detection and mitigation, defence against malicious URLs and protection from viruses and 
vulnerable attachments. Based on our assessment, which unearthed notable insights across various metrics, our 
forthcoming initiatives will aim to further fortify our security protocols and refine our email handling procedures to 
address any identified gaps.
Through our efforts, we have identified the following key observations across various metrics, which will inform our future initiatives aimed at further 
enhancing our security protocols and email handling procedures.
• Anti-Virus and Anti-Phishing Detection: Both Anti-Virus and Anti-Phishing detections show fluctuations throughout the year, with significant 
spikes observed in November for Anti-Virus detections and in October for Anti-Phishing attempts.
• Anti-Spam Detection: Anti-Spam detections also fluctuate, reaching the highest point in October and the lowest in March.
• Authentication Violations: Authentication violations show a relatively stable trend throughout the year, with occasional fluctuations.
• Content Filtering: Content filtering remains relatively consistent with minor fluctuations each month.
• Clean and Unprocessed Emails: The number of clean emails fluctuates throughout the year, while the number of unprocessed emails remains 
relatively stable.
• Total Email Volume: Total email volume fluctuates throughout the year, with significant increases observed in March and October.
OUR PERFORMANCE
During the year, we recorded zero substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy or losses of customer data. Moving forward, we 
will continuously seek innovative solutions to further enhance the security of our digital systems and ensure all confidential data is effectively protected.
ZERO
Number of substantiated complaints 
concerning breaches of customer 
privacy and losses of customer data
Velesto is pleased to report that there were no documented cases of data breaches during FY2023. Our proactive measures and vigilant monitoring 
systems have effectively safeguarded our organisation's data assets against unauthorised access and malicious activities.

INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY
WHY IT MATTERS
In an era marked by rapid technological advancements, we acknowledge the significance of innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge technology to 
uphold our operational excellence and fortify our resilience for the future. By prioritising the continual integration of new digital tools and technologies for 
enhancing our monitoring, communication and operational performance, we can elevate our efficiencies and maintain our competitive edge, positioning 
Velesto as a forward-thinking leader in the oil and gas sector.
OUR APPROACH
Approach Management Description and Initiatives
Embracing Technology 
to Unlock Efficiencies 
• We are dedicated to embracing the latest technological advancements and harnessing innovative digital tools, 
services and work methodologies to improve the speed and efficiency of our operations. This commitment has 
been cemented in our WAWASAN 2030 business strategy, under which ‘Technology & Capabilities’ has been 
identified as one of six core pillars to drive the Group towards its aspirations.
• Recent initiatives include the digitalisation of online vendor registration via our website, which has streamlined the 
application process for new vendors and enhanced the transparency and simplicity of our vendor management 
processes. To facilitate the shift to digital registration, we have eliminated the manual Supplier Request Form 
(“SREF”) previously used for new vendor registration.
• Additionally, we have adopted NEST, an internal online knowledge bank consolidating essential communication 
and knowledge-sharing activities into a user-friendly platform. Leveraging NEST and other digital tools, we have 
been able to seamless adopt hybrid work models for our corporate headquarters staff. This move aligns with our 
commitment to improving efficiency and sustainability, as remote work and flexible scheduling reduce commuting 
time for employees, while also serving to lower fuel consumption and emissions associated with transportation
Greater Adoption of 
Digital Management 
Tools
• We acknowledge the substantial benefits that the adoption of new software and digital applications can bring to 
our internal systems. Through the strategic use of these tools, we aim to elevate efficiency and oversight throughout 
our organisation and unlock internal synergies via software integration. 
• As described in our ‘Climate Change, Energy and Emissions’ topic on page 77, we have installed Rig Power 
Management Systems (“RPMS”) on three of our jack-up drilling rigs to enhance energy efficiency, while also utilising 
Variable Frequency Drives (“VFD”) on the fan motors of our air handling units to reduce energy consumption.
• Over the past year, we have also continuously explored innovative solutions to enhance various facets of our 
operations, including our HR systems, data analysis capabilities, asset management practices, and reporting and 
monitoring processes.

TCFD – ALIGNED 
DISCLOSURE
Mindful of evolving stakeholder expectations regarding 
climate action, the Group is dedicated to intensifying our 
endeavours to mitigate climate change. We have aligned 
our approach with the recommendations put forth by 
the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
("TCFD"), ensuring that our actions are strategic and 
impactful in addressing climate-related risks and 
opportunities.
The past years, Velesto has taken the steps to integrate climate considerations into business decision-
making as part of the overall sustainability governance by the Board and Senior Management . In 
2023, we have initiated the qualitative assessment of risks and opportunities on the management of 
climate-related issues. However, a more comprehensive scenarios analysis into the impact of climate 
change on the business will be conducted in 2024 as part of the Group progress towards developing 
its Net Zero 2050 roadmap. 
We will continue to take measures to reduce our exposure to the impacts of climate change and as 
such, the climate assessment will be conducted on an annual basis, taking into account changes in 
policy, technology, and the structure of markets. The progress and update on our management of 
climate-related issues will be consistently disclosed in our annual Sustainability Statement. This year, 
we are releasing a specific summary section of our alignment to TCFD which is structured to cover 
the four (4) core elements of the recommendations: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and 
Metrics & Targets.
CLIMATE GOVERNANCE
Velesto has a sound governance structure to guide and manage climate related risks as part of 
our existing corporate governance. In specific, our Board Risk Management Committees ("BRMC") 
oversees and manages sustainability-related issues including climate-related matters. The BRMC is 
supported by the Senior Management through the Sustainability Management Committee ("SMC") 
on day-to-day decision-making strategy advisory on sustainability-related matters including climate 
change and risks.
Some examples of climate-related topics discussed and reviewed in 2023 include:
• Emerging climate-related disclosure requirements and stakeholders’ demands 
• The Group performance on key ESG metrics and targets concerning climate change i.e., emission 
management, energy and water consumption, waste generation, and more
• Plan for commitment to Net Zero 2050 and decarbonisation strategy
For more details on Velesto sustainability governance structure and approach, please refer to Section 
on Our Approach to Sustainability on page 56-62.
CLIMATE STRATEGY
Velesto Commitment to a 
Sustainable Future
As a prominent service provider in the oil 
and gas sector, we are deeply committed to 
mitigating the environmental impacts of our 
operations, particularly concerning carbon 
emissions stemming from the diesel engines 
utilised on our rigs. In addition to addressing 
these Scope 1 emissions, alongside Scope 2 
emissions from grid-sourced electricity powering 
our facilities, we are actively identifying and 
quantifying limited indirect emission sources from 
our operations and third-party contributors within 
our value chain.
In further strengthening our effort towards 
decarbonisation of our value chain, we are 
committing to Net Zero 2050 in FY2024. 
Looking ahead, the Group will be conducting 
comprehensive assessment on its climate risks 
and opportunities, and business strategies as part 
of the Net Zero 2050 roadmap development. 
The progress will be monitored and disclosed 
consistently in our annual Sustainability Statement.
Understanding Our Climate-Related 
Risks and Opportunities
Velesto is still in the early stage of establishing 
a comprehensive climate risks assessment 
methodology. In 2023, climate risks and 
opportunities are assessed by our internal 
sustainability team to provide overview of the 
matter and advisory for future improvement as 
part of the Group’s enterprise risk management 
exercise on overall sustainability and ESG 
management.
As part of our continuous improvement, we will 
be conducting scenario analysis in consideration 
of time horizons for physical climate risks and 
the transition to a low-carbon economy risks and 
opportunities. The scenarios analysis will be 
adopting scenarios based on the IEA and The 
Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC AR6).

DEMARCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE BOARD LEVEL - HOW THE BOARD OPERATES
The Board Charter 
The effectiveness of the Board in fulfilling its duties is guided by the principles outlined in its Board Charter, a dynamic document continually updated to 
reflect evolving standards and regulatory requirements. Reviewed and refreshed on 29 November 2023, to align with the latest Main Market Listing 
Requirement ("MMLR") of BURSA and regulatory changes, including those mandated by MCCG 2021, the Board Charter remains our foundation of 
governance.
Regular reassessment of responsibilities across the Board, Board Committees, individual Directors, and Management ensures the organisation’s adaptability 
in response to shifting business landscapes, economic factors, and market dynamics. This flexible approach encourages innovation, value creation, and 
growth while increasing operational efficiencies and resource allocation.
Embedded within the Board Charter is a comprehensive framework defining the Group's governance structure, including the authority and Terms of 
Reference ("TOR") of its Board Committees, roles, and responsibilities. It serves as a guide for fostering commitment and guiding decision-making processes.
Available on the Company's corporate website, www.velesto.com, alongside the TORs of all Board Committees, the Board Charter promotes transparency 
and accountability. While specific authorities are delegated to various Board Committees, the Board remains informed through regular reports and the 
review of Committee minutes, ensuring thorough oversight and alignment with organisational priorities.
Principal Roles and Responsibilities of the Board 
As custodians entrusted with advancing the Group's success, the Board assumes the pivotal role of directing and overseeing the Group's operations with 
diligence and effectiveness. Individually, each Director bears the responsibility to act in the Company's best interests and with utmost good faith. Within 
this framework, the Board's key functions and responsibilities, outlined in the Board Charter, include:
• The Board provides guidance on the corporate strategic direction, governance, challenges assumptions, priorities, and options as proposed by 
Management in the strategic plan, while concurrently reviewing the Group's philosophy;
• It scrutinises the business plan and budget, establishing targets for Management to integrate sustainability considerations into its Environmental, Social, 
and Governance ("ESG") agendas;
• Together with Management, it assumes responsibility for governing sustainability within the Company, setting sustainability strategies, priorities, and 
targets;
• The Board reviews, approves, and offers feedback on corporate Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs") and targets, evaluating results quarterly, discussing 
significant variances, and ensuring corrective actions if necessary;
• Additionally, it selects and plans the President's succession proactively, evaluating the President's performance;
• The Board supports the promotion and instillation of good ethical practices and CG within the Group and among vendors, suppliers, service 
providers, and other business partners of Velesto Group;
• It establishes the Company's risk parameters, comprehends major risk exposures, ensures appropriate risk mitigation approaches, and considers risk 
factors in all major decisions;
• The Board balances and manages the economic impact of stakeholders' interests on shareholders' values, supporting Management in managing key 
stakeholders;
• It ensures that the Company's sustainability strategies, priorities, targets, and performance against these targets are effectively communicated to 
internal and external stakeholders;
• The Board takes proactive measures to remain informed and well-versed in sustainability matters pertinent to the Group and its operations, encompassing 
climate-related risks and opportunities; and
• Ensures that shareholders are provided with comprehensive information necessary for making informed decisions regarding the reappointment of 
a director. This encompasses disclosure of any interests, positions, or relationships that could potentially influence, or reasonably be perceived to 
influence, their ability to exercise independent judgment on Board matters and to act in the Company's best interests.

Assessment of Independence
 
The BNRC is responsible for assessing the 
independence of the INED annually. This 
assessment is based on the independent 
and constructive views, deliberations and 
contributions put forward by the INED during 
the Board meetings. This process is conducted 
through the Assessment of Independence of 
INED as part of the annual Board Evaluation. 
The criteria for assessing independence, as 
developed by the BNRC, are applied upon 
admission, annually and when any new interest 
or appointment develops.
In determining independence, the Independent 
Director must demonstrate the ability to provide 
objective challenge to Management, being 
prepared to advocate for their viewpoints in the 
interest of the Group, and ensuring no business 
or other interest exist that could influence, or 
appear to influence, their judgment.
During the Board Effectiveness Evaluation 
("BEE") for the year 2023, INEDs conducted 
a self-assessment of their independence. This 
assessment was based on criteria outlined 
by regulatory provisions and encompassed 
emerging and leading practices, including the 
concept of "independence in thought and mind" 
as per Guidance to Practice 5.3 of MCCG, 
2021. 
Based on the results of the BEE 2023, all INEDs 
affirmed their independence from Management 
and declared freedom from any business or 
other interests that might compromise their ability 
to exercise independent judgment or act in the 
best interests of the Group. These assessment 
outcomes were subsequently presented to the 
Board as part of the BEE results for FY2023.
The BNRC and the Board have, upon their 
assessment, concluded that the INEDs continue 
to demonstrate conduct and behaviour that are 
essential indicators of independence and their 
ability to act in the best interests of the Company. 
It has determined that they continue to fulfil the 
definition of independence, as set out in the 
MMLR.
In addition to the annual assessment, INEDs are 
required to disclose any conflicts or situations 
throughout the year that could potentially impact 
their independence. 
Tenure of Independent Director 
The Board Charter stipulates a maximum tenure of up to 9 years for its INEDs. For FY2023, none 
of the INEDs have exceeded this tenure limit, adhering to the Charter's regulations and aligned with 
Practice 5.4 of MCCG 2021. 
Appointment of a Director & Senior Management 
The appointment of a new Director is subject to deliberation and decision by the Board, based on 
recommendations forwarded by the BNRC. When making these recommendations, the BNRC takes 
into account the following factors:
• Objective criteria, merit and with due regard for diversity in skills, qualifications, experiences, 
core competencies, other qualities, ethnicity, age, cultural background, gender and years of 
directorship experiences;
• Expertise in strategy development, business model innovation and growth, corporate and industry 
level transformation, international business experiences and alternative domain expertise (as 
example renewable energy and green industry);
• Consideration of the current composition and the tenure of each director on the board to achieve 
the Board balance and the composition as required by the Company;
• Composition of skill matrix in order to strengthen board leadership and oversight of sustainability;
• Conflict of Interest and Potential Conflict of Interest;
• Time availability and commitment to serve the board effectively;
• His/her existing board positions and Fit & Proper assessment based on the Fit & Proper Policy of 
the Group; and 
• Information on his/her integrity and governance practices.
Appointment of Directors
Following the guidelines outlined in the Board Charter, the appointment process for Directors adheres 
to the following steps:
1. Identification of skills/gaps.
2. Approval on the parameters of search for the potential candidates.
3. Identification candidates from existing pool of candidates, recommendations from Board, 
Management, major shareholder or independent sources externally.
4. Shortlisted candidates referred to BNRC for consideration and recommendation to Board.
5. BNRC decides on appropriate means for review and approval of individual candidates.
6. BNRC will consider findings of evaluation process & current composition, attributes and 
qualifications that should represent at the Board.
7. Board’s Approval.
Aligned with the Board Charter, potential candidates may be proposed by current Board members, 
Management, or major shareholders. Furthermore, the BNRC has the option to enlist an independent 
entity or third-party sources to identify suitable candidates. Should the selection process exclusively 
rely on recommendations from existing Board members, Management, or major shareholders, the 
BNRC is required to provide reasoning for not exploring other sources.
During FY2023, the BNRC conducted a review of the Company’s succession plan for Board 
membership, which included review of the size and composition, with diversity and independence 
elements that meet the Company’s objectives and strategic goals. The results of this review were 
tabled for the Board’s consideration and recorded for future candidate sourcing of the Board.

Appointments to Board Committees
Reviewing the composition of the Board committees is an integral 
component of the Company's BEE. The BNRC considers various factors 
when determining candidates for appointment to the Board Committees, 
including (but not limited to) the following:
• The needs of the particular Board Committees;
• The results of the BEE for the Board Committees;
• Time commitment and availability;
• Regulatory requirements; and
• Best practices or governance practices.
Directors’ Re-election and Re-appointment
In assessing the Director’s eligibility for re-election, the BNRC considers 
his/her competencies, commitment, contribution, performance based on 
the BEE, fit and proper assessment, conflict of interest declaration and 
their ability to act in the best interest of the Company. The Board at its 
meeting held on 27 February 2024 endorsed the recommendation of the 
BNRC for the following Directors to be considered for re-election pursuant 
to the following relevant Articles of Velesto’s Constitution at the Company’s 
forthcoming 14th  Annual General Meeting ("AGM").
The following Directors are due for retirement and being eligible have

Appointments of Senior Management 
The Human Resources Division oversees the selection and appointment 
process for Senior Management positions, aligning candidates with 
criteria that closely fit the requirements of the role. Following this, selected 
candidates undergo interviews conducted by the President, alongside the 
Vice President of Human Resources. Subsequently, their nominations are 
presented to the BNRC for thorough deliberation and recommendation to 
the Board for final consideration and approval. These selection criteria 
encompass various aspects such as attributes, capabilities, qualifications, 
skills, and experiences.
Commitment
All Directors are expected to attend both scheduled Board meetings and 
those of the Board Committees they serve on. To facilitate this, the dates for 
these meetings throughout FY2023 were arranged and circulated to Board 
members during Q3 FY2022, allowing them ample time to manage their 
other commitments.
In instances where Directors are unable to attend a meeting due to 
exceptional circumstances, they still have access to meeting materials and 
relevant information. This enables them to engage with the relevant Chair, 
President, Senior Management, or Company Secretary on any matters they 
wish to address and subsequently follow up on decisions made during 
the meeting. Accessibility is maintained, with the Chairman, President, 
Senior Management, and Company Secretary readily available to discuss 
meeting-related issues or other matters with the Directors.
For FY2023, the Board was content that each Non-Executive Director 
("NED") was able to commit sufficient time to their role within the Company. 
Furthermore, in accordance with Paragraph 15.06(1) of the MMLR, 
none of the Board members holds more than five directorships in listed 
companies. Before accepting additional directorship appointments in other 
listed companies, Directors are required to notify the Company Secretary. 
Subsequently, such appointments are presented to the BNRC and the Board 
to address any conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest. These 
measures are implemented to ensure that such appointments do not impede 
their commitments or responsibilities to the Board. Additionally, there is no 
substitutes appointment for 8 Directors, while Fadzihan Abbas Mohamed 
Ramlee has an alternate director appointed on 1 September 2023, namely 
Nadzrin Alia Md Azizis. 
Board Skills Matrix
The Board comprises members with diverse skills and extensive experiences 
that complement each other effectively. This diverse mix of skills and 
experiences ensures that the Board is well-prepared to provide strategic 
guidance and direction for Velesto, positioning the company for success in 
the future and ultimately, enhancing shareholder value.
The Company’s assessment is based on the following Board Skills Matrix.

The Board holds responsibility for overseeing the Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") Framework and the internal control system within the Group, ensuring

The ERM Framework and internal control system within the Velesto Group serve to identify and evaluate the Group's key risks, aligning with its needs and 
exposures. While designed to manage risks, it is important to note that this system does not completely eliminate risks due to inherent limitations. Regular 
reviews conducted by the BAC, BRMC, and the Board ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's internal control system.
The Group's approach to risk management, including how risk profiles are identified and the key features of its ERM and internal control framework, are

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
This Statement on Risk Management and 
Internal Control (“SORMIC”) has been developed 
in alignment with Paragraph 15.26(b) of the 
Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) 
of BURSA, adhering to the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control: Guidelines 
for Directors of Listed Issuers as endorsed by 
BURSA, and in compliance with the stipulations 
of the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance 
2021 (“MCCG 2021”). The Board of Directors 
of Velesto Energy Berhad (“Velesto” or “the 
Group”) is pleased to present this statement, 
which defines the comprehensive nature and 
scope of risk management and internal controls 
within the Group for the financial year 2023.
Leveraging on an enhanced Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework, the Group is 
navigating the dynamic risk landscape and emerging trends, thereby ensuring effective and adequate 
implementation of risk mitigation strategies and continuous monitoring. This ERM Framework 
is complemented by a comprehensive system of internal controls, which includes governance, 
compliance, operational, financial, strategic and technological controls.
 
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
A. THE BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEES
Within Velesto, the Board and specific Board Committees manage a spectrum of risk-related roles 
and responsibilities, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive approach to risk oversight, governance, 
and strategic risk management across the organisation.
Board of Directors (“The Board”) 
Velesto’s Board of Directors upholds its responsibility for the governance of the Group’s risk 
management and internal control systems, as set out in the Board Charter. It is committed to the 
establishment and continual refinement of these systems to protect shareholders’ investments and the 
Group’s assets effectively. By setting a clear governance tone and exercising oversight function, the 
Board, in concert with Management, ensures the integration of risk management and internal controls 
within the Group’s operational processes and organisational structure. The Board acknowledges that 
these systems provide reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance in managing significant risks 
that could affect the Group’s objectives and strategic direction.
To support its oversight of risk management and internal controls, the Board has delegated specific 
responsibilities to the following committees, each possessing distinct yet complementary roles:
Board Risk Management Committee 
(“BRMC”)
The BRMC plays a pivotal role in fortifying 
Velesto’s ERM activities by guiding the 
implementation of the Group’s comprehensive 
ERM Framework, governed by the ERM Policy 
and ERM Framework Procedures. This committee 
is instrumental in advancing the Group’s Risk 
Management, Business Continuity Management 
("BCM"), and Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (“ESG”) risk management, 
alongside overseeing Health, Safety, and 
Environmental concerns. 
Board Audit Committee (“BAC”) 
The BAC is entrusted with the task of scrutinising 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control 
frameworks, thereby aiding the Board in its 
responsibilities related to financial reporting and 
accounting practices. This includes ensuring 
adherence to established accounting standards, 
maintaining a robust internal control system and 
management information systems, as well as 
complying with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements. 
The BAC's remit also extends to the examination 
of potential conflicts of interest and related 
party transactions, ensuring they align with the 
Group’s best interests and are conducted fairly, 
transparently, and without prejudice to minority 
shareholders. The committee oversees the 
internal and external audit processes, evaluating 
the internal control system's adequacy and 
effectiveness. Further insights into the BAC’s 
activities are provided in the BAC Report within 
this Integrated Annual Report.
Board Whistle-Blowing Committee 
(“BWBC”)
The BWBC is integral to fostering a culture of 
integrity, compliance, and ethical conduct within 
the Group. It is responsible for reviewing and 
investigating allegations against employees and 
other stakeholders, ensuring that Velesto upholds 
the highest standards of ethical behaviour and 
corporate governance.
The TOR of BRMC, BAC and BWBC are 
available on the Group’s website at www.
velesto.com

---- Page 177 ----
Section 05  •  Our Governance
B. THE MANAGEMENT 
Velesto's Management is entrusted with the role of executing the Board's directives on risk management and internal controls. Their responsibilities, which 
encompass a wide range of activities essential for maintaining the Group’s strategic and operational stability, are set out below:
Risk Oversight System Implementation 
and Effectiveness
Continuous Evaluation Leadership and Culture
Identify, evaluate and monitor 
risks that may affect the Group’s 
goals and strategies, ensuring a 
comprehensive understanding of 
potential internal and external 
challenges.
Formulate and enact effective 
risk management strategies 
and internal control measures, 
tailored to mitigate identified 
risks and enhance the Group’s 
resilience.
Undertake regular assessments 
of the risk management and 
internal control frameworks to 
ensure their continued relevance 
and effectiveness in the face of 
evolving risks and organisational 
objectives.
Promote the Group’s core values 
of iLEAP – Integrity, Leadership, 
Excellence, Agility, and People-
Focussed – by fostering an 
organisational culture that 
prioritises ethical conduct and 
good governance.
Through these focused efforts, the Management ensures the integrity of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.
C. INTERNAL AUDIT DIVISION (“IAD”) 
The IAD serves as a vital component of Velesto’s governance structure, executing a pivotal internal 
audit role that extends beyond conventional checks and balances. It delivers impartial and objective 
assurance concerning the robustness and efficacy of the Group’s internal control systems. The Head 
of IAD maintains a dual reporting line: functionally to the BAC, and administratively to the President, 
ensuring a high degree of independence from the Group’s operational and corporate entities.
Empowered with autonomy, the IAD formulates its audit scope, conducts thorough investigations, and 
communicates its findings directly to the BAC. This autonomy is crucial for maintaining the integrity 
and objectivity of the audit process.
The division’s activities are strategically aligned with the Group’s risk profile and operational priorities, 
as outlined in the annual internal audit plan endorsed by the BAC. Through its comprehensive reviews 
of internal controls, operational processes, and critical functions, the IAD plays an instrumental role in 
enhancing Velesto’s operational excellence and efficiency.
Committed to the highest standards of professional practice, the IAD adheres to the International 
Professional Practices Framework (“IPPF”) established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (“IIA”). This 
adherence emphasises the IAD’s dedication to excellence, integrity, and continuous improvement, 
ultimately contributing to Velesto’s strategic objectives and value creation.
IAD Highlights 2023
In 2023, the IAD conducted 10 reviews, along with targeted audit visits to the Group’s supply bases 
and rigs. The reviews focused on reinforcing controls over risk areas including inventory management, 
project management, sustainability, and financial processes. Audit reports containing audit findings, 
recommendations for improvement, and 
management action plans in the areas with 
significant risks and internal control deficiencies, 
were deliberated during the BAC meetings. 
These were also monitored regularly by the 
Management Audit Committee and reported to 
the BAC to ensure proper closure.
The IAD plays an active role in identifying 
areas for improvement in business processes, 
enhancing operational efficiency, and ensuring 
the achievement of Velesto’s business objectives. 
The division also carries out its mandate of 
continuously creating awareness within the 
organisation on relevant audit topics, including 
risk management, compliance requirements, and 
internal control best practices, by issuing the 
quarterly IAD Newsletter. 
In line with its responsibility to continuously 
improve the Group’s audit processes, the IAD

D. RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT (“RMD”) 
The RMD oversees the risk management functions for the Group at the enterprise level. Guided by the Group’s ERM Policy and Framework, the RMD's 
efforts are in alignment with directives from the RMC and the BRMC. 
The RMD evaluates and refines Velesto's risk processes ensuring they adhere to industry best practices. The department continuously engages and 
communicates with our employees to enhance and embed a culture of risk awareness and collective risk understanding within the organisation through 
targeted workshops, training and awareness initiatives. 
Central to the RMD's approach is the identification, assessment, and monitoring of key risks, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation process. This includes 
quarterly risk assessments and discussions with risk owners and risk representatives (who serve as the focal persons from the respective departments and 
divisions), to finetune control and mitigation strategies, ensuring these remain relevant to the changing business environment to minimise potential impacts 
on the Group’s operations and projects. 
The Group continues to monitor emerging ESG developments and regulations, identifying elements of risk related to ESG that need to be addressed and 
mitigated including climate(1) change considerations to enhance business resilience and sustainability. 
(1)  For more details discussion on climate related considerations, please refer to the TCFD-aligned Disclosure section of the Sustainability Statement of this IAR on page 113.
RMD Highlights 2023
In 2023, the RMD worked on refining Velesto’s ERM approach to better align with the Group’s key objectives and risk overview involving six areas and 
their potential impact on the Group:
Safety & Health Financial Reputation
Assets Environment Sustainability
Using the ERM framework, the Group’s risk registers including existing key controls and Risk Action Plans were reviewed and evaluated with risk 
owners. Quarterly engagement sessions were convened with risk owners and risks rated as “high” based on an approved matrix were escalated to 
the RMC and BRMC for thorough deliberation. To ensure these risks were monitored and managed effectively, dedicated risk owners assigned to 
each critical risk participated in discussions during the RMC and BRMC meetings, where they were challenged regarding the appropriate response 
and mitigation plans. 
In FY2023, developmental work to digitalise the risk management process commenced to improve its efficiency. The RMD intranet, unveiled in 
December, and ongoing updates on other internal social networking platforms, provided avenues for communication and knowledge sharing. A 
video of the President was produced and launched to communicate the importance of an effective risk culture, setting the tone from the top on the 
significance of integrating risk management in daily operations and the decision-making process.

E. INTEGRITY & GOVERNANCE UNIT AND COMPLIANCE (“IGUC”) 
STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The IGUC plays an essential role in fostering a culture of ethical conduct, 
integrity, and compliance within Velesto, actively combating corruption, 
abuse of power, and malpractice. It is mandated to report biannually on 
its activities and initiatives to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 
(“MACC”) through the Agency Integrity Management Division which is also 
known as Badan Pengurusan Integriti Agensi (“BPIA”). 
The IGUC's fundamental responsibilities encompass:
Good Governance
Championing the adoption and execution of 
exemplary corporate governance practices.
Integrity 
Enhancement
Cultivating, embedding, and actualising 
integrity principles across the organisation.
Detection and 
Verification
Identifying and confirming instances of 
criminal misconduct and ethical breaches, 
ensuring corrective measures are enacted 
and reporting such misconduct to relevant 
authorities.
Complaints 
Management
Addressing all reports and concerns related 
to criminal activities, code of conduct 
breaches, and ethical violations.
Compliance
Guaranteeing adherence to all 
organisational policies and procedures.
IGUC Highlights 2023
In 2023, the IGUC led a robust agenda to bolster integrity, 
governance, and compliance across the organisation. The year’s 
initiatives began with the Declaration of Fit & Proper and Conflict 
of Interest for Senior Management and onshore staff on 27 March, 
ensuring the team's alignment with Velesto's ethical standards.
Throughout the year, the IGUC issued quarterly newsletters, addressing 
critical themes such as “Extortion,” “Handling of Confidential 
Information,” “Embezzlement,” and “Integrity,” to enhance awareness 
and communication on integrity matters.
Corruption Risks Assessments were conducted quarterly, identifying 
potential risks and reinforcing the Group’s anti-corruption stance. The 
Velesto Assurance Review (“VAR”) further ensured compliance with 
internal policies and procedures through targeted reviews of selected 
departments and business units.
A series of integrity awareness sessions were rolled out for offshore 
crews, vendors, and staff across various divisions, emphasising Anti-
Bribery & Corruption (“ABAC”) principles. Notable events included the 
launch of the Velesto Anti-Corruption Plan 2023-2027 (“VACP 2023-
2027”) on 7 September, in line with National Anti-Corruption Plan 
(“NACP”) recommendations to develop a documented organisational 
anti-corruption strategy.
To enhance the comprehension of integrity and promote good 
governance among staff, the IGUC implemented a mandatory online 
Integrity Assessment exercise for all onshore personnel. Additionally, 
the IGUC spearheaded joint integrity events aimed at fostering 
stakeholder engagement. Notably, the Vendor Engagement Day, 
held on 27 September, brought together key vendors, while the 
Velesto Business Partner Integrity Day, held on 25 October, facilitated 
dialogue with clients, further solidifying the Group’s commitment to 
championing integrity across all its partnerships.
The IGUC's comprehensive approach in 2023, from educational 
initiatives to rigorous assessments and stakeholder engagement, 
significantly advanced Velesto’s commitment to maintaining a culture 
of integrity and ethical business practices.
INTEGRITY GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
The Group’s Integrity Governance Framework stands as the cornerstone of Velesto's commitment to ethical conduct. Serving as a strategic blueprint for the 
integration of robust internal control systems across the Group, it underpins Velesto’s dedication to upholding integrity and stringent compliance.
Under the stewardship of the IGUC, Velesto undertakes a holistic suite of programmes, activities, and initiatives designed to cultivate and perpetually 
refine a culture infused with integrity and governed by the highest standards of corporate governance. This commitment permeates every facet of the 
organisation's operations, ensuring ethical practices are not only encouraged but deeply ingrained at every level.
Central to these efforts is the adherence to the principles encapsulated in the acronym “T.R.U.S.T.”, a foundational element of Velesto's defence strategy 
against the Corporate Liability Provision as stipulated in Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (Amendment 2018). These 
principles guide Velesto's proactive approach to ethical governance, fortifying the organisation's defences against corruption.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Velesto's ERM Framework, which provides 
a structured and systematic approach to risk 
management, plays a crucial role in the Group’s 
value-creation efforts. It incorporates consistent 
assessment methodologies and standards across 
the Group’s processes and operations, ensuring 
comprehensive identification, evaluation, 
mitigation, and monitoring of both inherent and 
emerging risks.
The Group’s commitment to the ISO 31000 
Risk Management – Guidelines Standard and 
continuous enhancements in practices and 
operations have significantly strengthened 
Velesto's ERM Framework over time.
B. RISK REPORTING STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS
Velesto's clear reporting structure and 
comprehensive risk oversight functions 
are essential for effective communication 
and information dissemination about risk 
management processes throughout the Group. 
This ensures that risk management is integral to 
decision-making at all levels.

C. VELESTO GROUP TOP RISKS OVERVIEW 
In 2023, Velesto Group addressed its top risks through comprehensive action plans and initiatives as follows:
Risk Overview Response
Technology & 
Cybersecurity Risk
(For further details, 
please refer to page 
111)
The continued focus on digitalising the business processes increases the risk of cybersecurity threats, including 
phishing, malware, ransomware, and data breaches. These vulnerabilities may result in operational disruptions, 
financial losses and reputational damage.
In response, Velesto has strengthened its cybersecurity defences, by implementing various detective and protective 
cyber security measures through a dedicated information security team. The Group has also conducted annual 
testing and independent assessments to further safeguard its IT system and network. 
Human Capital 
Risk
(For further details, 
please refer to page 
90-91)
Increased competition and challenges in attracting and retaining high-performing and high-potential employees 
are key industry concerns. The inability to attract and retain the right skilled talent would influence operational 
efficiencies. 
For FY2023, the Group continued to ensure competitive overall rewards for the employees, including awarding 
Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) benefits to employees who are in critical positions, are high performers 
and have high potential. Additionally, a structured training and development programme was developed focusing 
on various professional aspects. The culture transformation programme was launched to align employees with the 
Velesto way of working.
Execution Risk
Three Special Periodic Surveys (“SPS”) projects are planned for 2024 in line with the classification certification 
requirements. Any delay or setback could affect operational efficiency and result in missed opportunities for 
revenue generation.
The Group has implemented measures to mitigate execution risk in rig maintenance processes at the shipyards 
through the execution of pre-shipyard preparatory work, identifying equipment maintenance requirements 
and spares, and leveraging on third party project management expertise to pre-empt potential issues prior to 
commencing the shipyard phase.
Integrated projects such as the i-RDC, could expose Velesto to operational disruptions caused by its service 
partners and impact service delivery. 
To address this risk, the Group continuously engages with its clients and partners to enhance project performance 
and negotiate improved terms and conditions for additional wells. It also systematically monitors and analyses 
performance across every section of each well to identify areas for improvement.

P. 180 … 181
Risk Overview Response
Process Risk
(For further details, 
please refer to page 
84-89)
The escalation of activities on Velesto’s rigs increases the potential of risks and hazards in the workplace, requiring 
increased monitoring and adherence to safety regulations and standards to uphold customer expectations for 
high-quality services. 
Velesto is proactively reinforcing accountability and applying rigorous consequence management for all HSE 
incidents. The Group is also promoting Management HSE Visits to offshore sites, emphasising the obligation 
and authority of personnel to stop work when necessary. Moreover, Velesto is enforcing stringent and transparent 
Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) policies and regulations, and providing robust medical support at the 
worksites to safeguard its workforce and maintain operational excellence. 
Strategic Risk
(For further details, 
please refer to page 
41)
The strategic risk from external or internal headwinds could impact Velesto’s earnings, reputation, operations and 
market position. 
To address potential strategic risks and safeguard the long-term outlook of Velesto’s Wawasan 2030 ("Vision 
2030"), the Group is continuously assessing geopolitical impacts, adapting to technological trends and 
advancements through the installation of NOVOS on NAGA 4, and engaging with clients to better understand 
their needs and requirements.
Sustainability Risk
(For further details, 
please refer to page 
63)
The dynamic sustainability landscape exposes Velesto to risk as sustainability is no longer merely a ‘nice-to-
have’ narrative but a ‘license-to-operate’ imperative. Inadequate sustainability governance will expose Velesto 
to potential risks such as losing business opportunities, reputational damage, diminished economic performance 
and other ESG liabilities.
In response, Velesto has embedded sustainability into its decision-making process and integrated ESG as its core 
business strategy. For 2023, the Group focused on ensuring regulatory compliance, operationalising emission
reduction initiatives, initiating climate-related risk considerations, and building the capacity of its people in relation 
to sustainable practices.
The initiatives outlined above underscore Velesto’s strategy in addressing and mitigating its key risks, including technology and cybersecurity, human 
capital, execution, process efficiency, strategic considerations and ESG risks. The Group is committed to reducing its risk exposure, thereby minimising its 
influence on operational outcomes. This focus ensures that Velesto remains resilient and adaptable, laying a solid foundation for sustained value creation 
and long-term sustainability.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT (“BCM”) 
Velesto’s commitment to maintaining operational readiness in the face of evolving risks forms the basis of its BCM initiatives conducted throughout each 
financial year. The Group’s BCM Framework is a comprehensive approach that empowers Management to pinpoint potential threats and assess their 
impact on business operations, thereby crafting a robust strategy to mitigate these risks. This ensures the Group’s resilience, safeguarding stakeholder 
interests, brand equity, and reputation.
The BCM Framework is built on four essential components:
Business Continuity 
Policy
This policy sets forth the foundational principles, priorities, and governance for the Group’s business  
continuity efforts.
Business Continuity 
Oversight Structure
This structure delineates clear accountability, roles, and responsibilities for the implementation and updates to the 
BCM Framework.
BCM Methodology
This outlines the strategic approach for developing effective strategies and the corresponding Business Continuity 
Plan or BCP.
BCM Programme This programme outlines critical milestones and timelines to bolster the Group’s business continuity capabilities.
Velesto has to date embraced the ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity Management System Standard, reinforcing its commitment to best practices in BCM.

C. CRISIS MANAGEMENT
Crisis Management at Velesto is a holistic process which entails responding to and managing crises effectively to protect People, Environment, Assets, and 
Reputation (“PEAR”) while minimising potential damage to the Group’s reputation, operational viability, and financial performance. 
In 2023, the Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) and Emergency Management Team (“EMT”) underwent refresher briefing sessions on 24 and 25 July. 
These sessions aimed to reaffirm their understanding of the CMT organisational structure, crisis roles, operational procedures, tools and checklists, insights 
derived from Exercise Delta 2022, and the subsequent actions required.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
Velesto’s Board has established internal control systems that provide direction, effective governance and oversight of internal controls. They comprise the 
following key elements: 
A. ORGANISATION STRUCTURE
The Board has established an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibilities, accountability and limits of authority, that are aligned 
to the corporate and operational requirements.

comprises of the CFO as the chairperson and selected senior division heads. 
The organisation structure and delegation of responsibilities are communicated throughout the Group which sets out amongst other things, authorisation 
levels, segregation of duties and other risk and control procedures.
B. ANNUAL BUSINESS PLAN AND BUDGET 
A business planning and budgetary exercise is conducted annually, which includes industry and market studies, formulation of business strategies, and the 
establishment of KPIs. These are then presented for the Board’s deliberation and approval prior to implementation. 
The budgets prepared by the operating units and corporate divisions are regularly compared with the actual results and the explanations on variances are 
then incorporated in management reports which are prepared for the Board on a quarterly basis.
C. CORE VALUES AND CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 
The Group’s iLEAP core values of “Integrity, Leadership, Excellence, Agility and People-Focused” and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“CoBE”), 
are the essential guiding principles to drive behavioural ethics. iLEAP is embedded in employees’ assessments to cultivate the values embraced by the 
Group.

P. 186 … 187
The BAC operates across six distinct yet interrelated focus areas, 
harmoniously reinforcing one another to uphold the Group's fiduciary duties 
concerning financial reporting and a robust internal control framework, 
thereby serving as a cornerstone of the Group’s corporate governance 
structure.
All INEDs meet the criteria for independence as outlined in BURSA’s MMLR, 
and no Independent Director has appointed alternate directors. Currently, 
the Chairman of the BAC, Alan Hamzah Sendut who was appointed on 
2 February 2024 to replace Datuk Tong Poh Keow, is a member of the 
Malaysian Institute of Accountants. Consequently, the BAC adheres to the 
stipulation of paragraph 15.09(1)(c)(i) of the MMLR.
The Board Nomination & Remuneration Committee ("BNRC") conducted the 
annual performance evaluation of the BAC and its members for FY2023, 
with the report thereof being reviewed by the Board. Mindful of the BAC’s 
need for diverse skills and attributes, the evaluation encompassed factors 
such as requisite knowledge, expertise, and commitment of time. The 
Board is content that throughout FY2023, the BAC and its members had 
discharged their functions, duties, and responsibilities in accordance with 
the BAC’s Terms of Reference ("TOR"). Further details on Board Effectiveness 
Evaluation ("BEE") results for FY2023 are provided in the Corporate 
Governance Overview Statement of this Integrated Annual Report.
As a committee of the Board, the BAC operates under delegated authority 
and empowerment as outlined in its TOR. It serves as a crucial link between 
the Board, Management, Internal Auditor, and External Auditors, facilitating 
effective communication and oversight.
TOR
The TOR governing the BAC delineate various facets, including 
objectives, functions, authority, duties, and responsibilities, encompassing 
the aforementioned focus areas of the BAC. Within this framework are 
specifications regarding the size and composition prerequisites, along 
with administrative protocols crucial for the effective execution of its 
responsibilities.
The TOR of the BAC is publicly accessible on Velesto’s website at  
www.velesto.com.
COMPOSITION
In the FY2023, the BAC was composed of four members, all holding 
positions as Non-Executive Directors ("NEDs"). As of 31 December 2023, 
the entire membership of the BAC consists of INEDs, thereby ensuring 
complete adherence to the stipulations outlined in paragraph 15.09(1)(a) 
and (b) of MMLR, as well as Principle B of the MCCG 2021.
MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE
Throughout FY2023, the BAC convened six (6) meetings, with detailed 
attendance records provided in the Corporate Governance Overview

Annual Reporting 
On 22 March 2023, the BAC conducted a review and approved the 
Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control ("SORMIC"), BAC 
Report, and Additional Compliance Information to be included in the 
Integrated Annual Report 2022. On 11 April 2023, the BAC revisited 
SORMIC pertaining to the reviewed fiscal year. The endorsed SORMIC 
was presented to the Board for final approval and subsequent inclusion in 
the Integrated Annual Report 2022.
On 25 March 2024, the BAC reviewed and endorsed the SORMIC, 
BAC Report, and Additional Compliance Information to be included in the 
Integrated Annual Report 2023.
Internal Control
The BAC actively oversees Conflict of Interest management as outlined 
in its TOR. It reviews any instances of conflicts of interest within the 
Company or the Group, including transactions, procedures, or behaviors 
that raise concerns regarding management integrity. The BAC assesses the 
effectiveness of internal controls based on findings from both Internal and 
External Audit reports.
During its meeting on 21 March 2024, the BAC evaluated conflict of 
interest situations, procedures, and measures implemented during the fiscal 
year ending 2023. Additionally, the BAC received information regarding 
the Conflict of Interest assessment conducted by BNRC and agreed to 
present this information to the Board for acknowledgment.
External Audit
On 11 April 2023, the BAC conducted a review of the External Auditors’ 
Report on the Audited Financial Statements for the fiscal year 2022. During 
this session, Mimie Joanna Johar, the lead audit engagement partner from 
EY, affirmed EY’s independence throughout the audit process, complying 
with professional and regulatory requirements, including the By-Laws of 
the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. The BAC was briefed on key audit 
matters outlined in the report.
During its meeting on 22 March 2023, the BAC performed an annual 
evaluation of the External Auditors' performance, assessing their suitability, 
objectivity, and independence. The BAC expressed satisfaction with EY’s 
overall performance for the Group.
The BAC held two private meetings with the External Auditors on 21 
February 2023, and 11 April 2023, excluding Management. During 
these sessions, the BAC inquired about the audit progress, cooperation 
from the Group, and adequacy of resources allocated. The External 
Auditors presented their findings and significant audit matters for the BAC’s 
consideration. The BAC discussed recommendations and Management's 
responses, ensuring follow-up actions were taken. The Chairperson of the 
BAC urged the External Auditors to collaborate with Management for audit 
efficiency.
On 23 November 2023, the BAC reviewed and sanctioned the External 
Auditors’ Audit Plan Memorandum for the fiscal year 2024. This document 
outlined the scope of work, audit strategy, engagement team details, areas 
of emphasis, audit timeline, and focus on key audit matters. Additionally, 
the BAC evaluated and recommended the audit fees payable to the 
External Auditors for approval by the Board.
INTERNAL AUDIT
On 21 February 2023, the BAC reviewed and approved the Annual IA 
Plan for the fiscal year 2023.
Similarly, the 2024 Annual IA Plan underwent review and approval on 23 
November 2023. The BAC ensured that the plan adequately identified 
principal risks, key entities, and functions. Additionally, the BAC assessed 
the IAD’s manpower plan and budget for fiscal year 2024 to guarantee 
sufficient resources, competencies, and coverage of audit areas.
Throughout the year, the Head of IAD presented IAD reports at each BAC 
meeting. Quarterly reviews of the Annual Audit Plan included discussions on:
•  Progress of the annual internal audit plan, special reviews, and key 
initiatives.
•  Sufficiency of Management’s responses to audit findings and 
recommendations.
•  Adequacy of IAD resources, training, and development.
During quarterly meetings, the BAC considered major findings, 
recommendations, and Management’s responses regarding internal audit 
issues. All audit findings were reported to the BAC, Senior Management, 
and relevant entities' Management.
Accountability for addressing audit issues and implementing action 
plans lies with the Management of the audited entities. Timely handling 
and implementation of action plans are imperative. IAD, along with the 
Management Audit Committee, follows up on actions taken by audited 
operating units and updates their status in subsequent audits.

Section 05  •  Our Governance
INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The IAD plays an integral role in bolstering the assurance framework of the 
Group. Its core mandate is to furnish independent and judicious assurance 
concerning the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s overarching 
system of internal control, risk management, and governance processes.
In supporting the BAC's governance obligations as outlined in its TOR, 
the BAC is aided by an in-house internal audit function, namely the IAD. 
Norzalizah Alias, the Head of IAD, directly reports to the BAC on functional 
matters and to the President on administrative affairs. Regular updates on 
IAD activities and key control issues identified by internal auditors are 
provided to the BAC.
The Internal Audit Charter delineates the purpose, authority, and 
responsibilities of the IAD. To uphold its independence and objectivity, the 
IAD maintains no operational jurisdiction over auditees' activities.
As of 31 December 2023, the IAD comprised five (5) staff members. 
Resource allocation for the internal audit function totalled RM1.15 million 
(FY2022: RM0.87 million), covering primarily personnel expenses and 
incidental costs such as travel and training. The IAD adopts a risk-centric 
approach to audit planning and execution, prioritising significant identified 
risks and evaluating the efficacy of risk mitigation controls.
Adherence to the Institute of Internal Auditors’ International Professional 
Practices Framework ("IPPF"), encompassing the Definition of Internal 
Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, guides the IAD in its audit 
engagements.
Further details regarding the Internal Control Oversight Structure, including 
the role of the IAD, are elaborated upon in the SORMIC section of this 
Integrated Annual Report.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS ("RPT") & RECURRENT RPT 
("RRPT")
The Company has implemented a Management System Procedure ("MSP 
RPT") concerning RPT and RRPT, outlining guidelines and procedures for 
identifying, reviewing, tracking, and reporting RPT and RRPT by personnel in 
relevant departments and divisions responsible for executing the procedure.
Throughout the period under review, the RPT Secretariat, established under 
the MSP RPT, played a pivotal role in coordinating and overseeing RPT/
RRPT compliance across the Group. All RPTs and RRPTs were duly reported 
to the BAC and subsequently to the Board on a quarterly basis.
The IAD conducted quarterly reviews of all RPT/RRPTs undertaken by the 
Group during the period under review and is satisfied that these transactions 
were conducted at arm’s length and in a manner not detrimental to the 
interests of Group and its minority shareholders.
This BAC Report has been presented and approved by the BAC and the 
Board at their meeting held on 21 March 2024 and 25 March 2024 
respectively.

the Group and of the Company, and statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group 
and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on 
pages 201 to 264. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 
December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting 
Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
 
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian 
Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) 
(“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of 
how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in 
relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the 
basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and rights of use assets: drilling services and hydraulic workover asset
  
As disclosed in Note 4 and 8 to the financial statements, included in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment and rights of use assets of 
the Group as at 31 December 2023 are assets related to the drilling services segment and hydraulic workover operation ("drilling services and hydraulic 
workover assets") of RM2,389.9 million and RM3.9 million respectively, which collectively represents 77% of the Group's total assets. The accumulated 
impairment loss on drilling services and hydraulic workover assets as at 31 December 2023 is RM2,119.8 million. The Group did not recognised any 
impairment loss on the property, plant and equipment during the financial year.
The Group is required to assess at each reporting period whether there is any indication that a cash generating unit (“CGU”) may be impaired. If any 
such indication exists, the Group shall estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU(s).
Due to the uncertainties of the demand and supply in the oil and gas industry and the volatile oil prices, the Group has determined that there are indications 
that the assets of drilling services and hydraulic workover assets may be impaired. Accordingly, the Group estimated the recoverable amount of the 
respective cash generating units ("CGU"s) based on their fair value less cost to sell or their respective value-in-use ("VIU"), whichever is higher.

Key audit matters (cont’d.)
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and rights of use assets: drilling services and hydraulic workover asset (cont'd.)
Estimating the recoverable amounts based on VIU involved estimates made by management relating to the future cash inflows and outflows that will be 
derived from the CGU and discounting them at the appropriate rate. The cash flow forecasts included a number of significant judgements and estimates 
such as the expected operating day rates and utilisation rate of the rigs/hydraulic workover units, estimated terminal value of the assets and the discount 
rates.
Given the significance of the drilling services and hydraulic workover assets to the Group and the significant judgements and estimates involved in the 
assessment of the recoverable amounts, we have identified the above impairment assessments as an area of focus to our audit.
Our procedures in reviewing the significant judgements and estimates applied in arriving at the recoverable amount for the impairment assessment as at 
31 December 2023, include interalia the following:
-  Obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and internal controls over the estimating the recoverable amount of the CGUs;
- Evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology and approach applied;
- Evaluated the key assumptions used by management in the cash flow projections on whether they are reasonable by comparing to past actual 
information and by corroborating with industry analysts' views, management's plans, existing contracts and upcoming bidding opportunities, 
where applicable;
- Evaluated the discount rates and the methodology used in deriving the present value of the cash flows, with the support of our internal valuation 
specialists;
-  We have performed sensitivity analysis on the key inputs to understand the impact that alternative assumptions would have had on the 
recoverable amounts; and
-  Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.
Impairment assessment of investments in subsidiaries
As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries companies of the Company amounted to RM1,012.3 million, representing 
44% of the Company's total assets. The accumulated impairment loss on cost of investments in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023 is RM2,559.6 
million.
As disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements, during the financial year, certain subsidiaries with a carrying amount of RM989.4 million have reported 
continuing operating losses and/or depleting shareholders’ funds which indicate that the investments in these subsidiaries may be impaired. The Company 
estimated the recoverable amount of the subsidiaries using value in use based on discounted future cash flows and compared the carrying amount of the 
investments in subsidiaries with their respective recoverable amounts.
Given the significance of investment in subsidiaries to the Company and the significant judgements and estimates involved in the assessment of the 
recoverable amount, we have identified the above impairment assessment as an area of focus to our audit.
In addressing the matter above, we have performed amongst others the following audit procedures: 
-   Obtained an understanding of the relevant processes and internal controls over the estimation of present value of estimated future cash flows;
-   Evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology and approach applied;
-   Evaluated the key assumptions used in determination of the present value of estimated future cash flows such as expected operating day rates, 
utilisation rates, inflation rate, bareboat chartered rates, estimated terminal value by comparing to past actual outcomes, management’s plans, 
existing contracts and upcoming bidding opportunities, where applicable; 
-   Evaluated the discount rates used in used in deriving the present value of the cash flows; and
-   Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.

Section 06  •  Financial Statements
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon
 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual 
report and the Directors' Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company and our auditors' report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report. The Group's 2023 Annual Report is expected to 
be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.
 
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view 
in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 
2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or 
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Company’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
directors.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont'd.)
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express 
an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. 
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
 
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the 
Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, 
are disclosed in Note 30 to the financial statements.
Other matters
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for 
no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
 Velesto Energy Berhad ("Velesto") is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and is listed on the Main Market of 
Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Malaysia"). The registered office of Velesto is located at Level 18, Block 3A, Plaza Sentral, Jalan Stesen 
Sentral 5, 50470 Kuala Lumpur.
 The principal activity of the Company is to carry on the business of an investment holding company and to provide full corporate management, 
administrative and professional services as well as financial support to its subsidiary companies. The principal activities of the subsidiaries and 
associate are described in Notes 30 and Note 6 to the financial statements, respectively.
 The Group is principally engaged in:
(a) the provision of drilling services for exploration, development and production wells and workover services to the upstream sector of the oil 
and gas industry;
(b) the provision of integrated services includes workover operations for the oil and gas industry; and
(c)  the provision of threading, inspection and repair services for Oil Country Tubular Goods ("OCTG") in overseas, with a focus on premium 
connections used in high-end and complex wells.
 
 The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 15 April 2024.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION
2.1 Basis of preparation
 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company comply with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
 On 1 January 2023, the Group and the Company adopted the new and amended MFRSs and IC Interpretation (collectively referred to as 
"pronouncements") issued by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (“MASB”) that are mandatory for the financial periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2023 as described fully in Note 2.3.
 MASB has also issued new and revised MFRSs which are not yet effective for the Group and the Company and therefore, have not been 
implemented by the Group and the Company in these financial statements as set out in Note 2.4.
 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis unless otherwise indicated in the 
accounting policies below.
 The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (RM'000) except when 
otherwise indicated.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the provisions of the Companies Act 2016 and MFRSs in Malaysia, requires 
the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reported year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There are no areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or 
areas where estimates and assumptions are material to the financial statements other than as disclosed in Note 3.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)
2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(a) Basis of consolidation, subsidiaries and associate
(i) Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting 
date. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements are prepared as of the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like 
transactions and events in similar circumstances.
 The Company controls an investee if and only if the Company has all the following:
-  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
-  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee; and
-  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
 When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, the Company considers the following in 
assessing whether or not the Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power over the investee:
- The size of the Company's holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote 
holders;
- Potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties; 
- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
- Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability 
to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous 
shareholders' meetings.
 Subsidiaries are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition, being a date on which the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases, being the effective date of disposal.
 Intragroup transactions, balances and resulting unrealised gains are eliminated in full on consolidation. The consolidated 
financial statements reflect external transactions only. Unrealised losses are eliminated on consolidation unless the cost cannot 
be recovered. 
 Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries 
are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and non-controlling interests are 
adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. The resulting difference is recognised directly in 
equity and attributed to owners of the Company.
 Loss of control
 When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of 
the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the carrying amount 
of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any goodwill outstanding (net of any non-controlling interest) 
at the date the Group loses control, is recognised in profit or loss. The subsidiary's cumulative gain or loss which has 
been recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss or 
where applicable, transferred directly to retained earnings. The fair value of any investment retained in the former 
subsidiary at the date control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(a) Basis of consolidation, subsidiaries and associate (cont'd.)
(i) Basis of consolidation (cont'd.)
 Business combinations
 Business combinations, other than business combinations under common control, are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date.
 The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred measured at acquisition-date fair value 
and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether 
to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's 
identifiable net assets. For business combinations after 1 January 2011, acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
 Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of MFRS 9 
Financial Instruments is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in accordance with 
MFRS 9. Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of MFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting 
date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
 When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and 
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition 
date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
 If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest 
in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
 Business combinations under common control
 Business combinations under common control are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements retrospectively from 
the date the Group obtains the ownership interest. Assets and liabilities are recognised upon consolidation at their carrying 
amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Any difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the 
amounts at which the assets and liabilities are recorded is recognised directly in equity.
(ii)  Subsidiaries
 A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has all the following:
-  Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee);
-  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its investment with the investee; and
 
-  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns. 
(iii) Associate
 
 An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those decisions. Investment in 
associate is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described in Note 
2.2(a)(iv).

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(a) Basis of consolidation, subsidiaries and associate (cont'd.)
 
(iv) Equity method of accounting
 
 Under the equity method, the investments in associate are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost 
adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. The Group’s share of the net profit or 
loss of the associate is recognised in profit or loss. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the 
associate, the Group recognises its share of such changes.
 In applying the equity method, unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and the associate are 
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. After application of the equity method, the Group determines 
whether it is necessary to recognise any additional impairment loss with respect to the Group’s net investment in the associate. 
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is 
impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount 
of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss. An associate is equity accounted for from 
the date on which the investee becomes an associate.
 Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised. Any excess of the 
Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the 
investment is excluded from the carrying amount of the investment and is instead included as income in the determination of 
the Group’s share of the associate's profit or loss in the year in which the investment is acquired.
 
 When the Group’s share of losses in the associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any long-term 
interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further 
losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
 The most recent available audited financial statements of the associate are used by the Group in applying the equity method. 
Where the dates of the audited financial statements used are not coterminous with those of the Group, the share of results is 
arrived at from the last audited financial statements available and management financial statements to the end of the accounting 
year of the Group.  Uniform accounting policies are adopted for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
(v) Separate financial statements 
 In the separate financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries and associate are accounted for at cost less 
impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts 
is included in profit or loss.
(b) Property, plant and equipment 
 All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment 
(including spare parts and standby-equipment) is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
 Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses. When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in intervals, the Group 
recognises such parts as individual assets with specific useful lives and depreciation, respectively.
 Periodic survey and drydocking costs are incurred in connection with obtaining regulatory certification to operate the rigs on an 
ongoing basis. Costs associated with the certification are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period between 
surveys and drydocking. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(b) Property, plant and equipment (cont'd.)
 Assets-in-progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use. 
Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is provided for on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
as follows:
Rigs and hydraulic workover units ("HWUs") 10 - 30 years
Drilling equipment 1 - 30 years
Buildings 10 - 20 years
Plant and machinery 2 - 30 years
Office equipment, computer software, furniture and fittings 3 - 12 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Renovation and improvements 5 years
 The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if 
appropriate.
 An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the period the asset is 
derecognised. 
 
 The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses is in accordance 
with Note 2.2(p).
(c) Financial assets
 The Group and the Company applied MFRS 9 Financial Instruments as disclosed below:
 Initial recognition and measurement 
 
 Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at either amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. 
 
 The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and 
the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value 
plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain 
a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price 
determined under MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
 In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income 
(“OCI”), it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. The assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. 
 The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash 
flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, 
or both. 
 
 Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

NOTES TO THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D.)
2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(c) Financial assets (cont'd.)
 Subsequent measurement
 For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets of the Group are classified in two categories: 
(i)  Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
 This category is the most relevant to the Group. The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following 
conditions are met:
- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows; and 
-   The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 
 Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method and are subject to 
impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets at amortised cost include trade receivables, other receivables (other than 
prepayments), amounts due from subsidiaries and deposits, cash and bank balances.
(ii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon 
initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. 
Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term.
 Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be classified at 
amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, debt instruments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial 
recognition if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statements of financial position at fair value with the net 
changes in fair value recognised in the statements of profit or loss.
 
 The Group's and the Company's financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include investment in money market fund.
 Derecognition
 A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily 
derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:
- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash 
flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(c) Financial assets (cont'd.)
 Derecognition (cont'd.)
 
 When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it 
evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has 
retained.
 Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be required to repay.
(d) Impairment of financial assets 
 The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or 
loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will 
include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. 
 ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 
12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a 
loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default 
(a lifetime ECL). 
 
 For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a 
provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and 
the economic environment. 
 
 The Group considers a financial asset in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive 
the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group.
(e) Cash and cash equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and bank balances and deposits at call with licensed banks with a tenure of three months 
or less that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(f) Inventories  
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. In arriving at net 
realisable value, due allowance has been made for obsolete and slow-moving items.
 Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition are accounted for as follows: 
Materials and spares used -  Weighted average
 
 Cost of finished goods, raw materials, spares and consumables represents cost of purchase.

(g) Foreign currencies 
 
(i) Functional and presentation currency 
 The financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates (""the functional currency""). The consolidated financial statements are presented in RM, which is also 
the Company's functional currency.
(ii) Foreign currency transactions
 Transactions in currencies other than the Company's and its subsidiaries' functional currency (""foreign currencies"") are initially 
converted into functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the transaction dates.
 Non-monetary items 
 At each reporting date, foreign currency non-monetary items which are carried at historical cost are translated using the 
historical rate as of the date of the initial transaction and non-monetary items which are carried at fair value are translated 
using the exchange rate as of the date when the fair values were determined.
 Monetary items 
 At each reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at exchange 
rates ruling at that date.
 Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the translation of monetary items, are included in 
profit or loss for the period. 
 Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operation are taken 
directly to the foreign currency translation reserve within other comprehensive income until the disposal of the foreign operation, 
at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
(iii) Foreign operations
 The financial statements of foreign operations which are consolidated are translated at year-end exchange rates with respect 
to the assets and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for the year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of 
the transactions with respect to profit or loss. All resulting translation differences are included in the foreign currency translation 
reserve within other comprehensive income.
 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2006 are treated 
as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are recorded in the functional currency of the foreign operation and 
translated at the closing rate at the reporting date. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign 
operation before 1 January 2006 are deemed to be assets and liabilities of the parent company and are recorded in RM at 
the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.

 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost as 
appropriate.  
 
 All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of financial liabilities at amortised cost, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs. 
 
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables (other than provisions), loans and borrowings, 
lease liabilities and amounts due to subsidiaries. 
 
 Subsequent measurement 
 
 Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings) 
 
 After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation 
process. 
 Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part 
of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statements of profit or loss. 
 
 This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings. 
 Derecognition 
 
 A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statements of profit or loss. 
 
(i) Offsetting of financial instruments 
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statements of financial position if, and only 
if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 
(j) Provisions 
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated 
reliably. 
 Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an 
outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. 
When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

(k) Borrowing costs 
 Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use 
or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are 
substantially completed for their intended use or sale.  
 
 All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that the Group incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. 
(l) Income taxes  
 Income tax in the profit or loss for the period comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax assets and liabilities are measured 
at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the 
amounts are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
 Current taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.  
 Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and 
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associate, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is 
probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax 
losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except in respect of deductible temporary differences 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and associate, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that 
the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.  
 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit 
will allow the deferred tax assets to be utilised.   
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or 
the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
 Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised 
in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a 
business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.  
 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(m) Revenue and other income recognition
 
 Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Group recognises revenue when or 
as it transfers control over a good or service to the customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of the 
asset.
 
 An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore, satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue 
over time, if one of the following criteria is met: 
-  the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs;
-  the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is 
created or enhanced; or
-  the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right 
to payment for performance completed to date.
 
 If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with the above criteria, an entity satisfies the performance 
obligation and recognises revenue at a point in time.
(i) Revenue from provision of drilling and workover services and related expenses
 
 Revenue from provision of drilling and workover services includes minimum lease payments from customers under day-rate 
based contracts and other services. Revenue generated from day-rate based contracts, which are classified as operating lease 
by the Group, are recognised over time over the contract period.
 Day-rate based contracts may include fees for mobilisation and demobilisation which are recognised based on the policies 
stated in Note 2.2(m)(ii) and (iii) for workover services contracts, whereas as a percentage of the operating day rate for drilling 
services contracts. Fees received from customers under contract for upgrade to the rig are deferred and recognised over the 
contract term.
 Additional payments for meeting or exceeding certain performance targets are recognised at the point in time at which the 
service is performed. 
(ii) Lump sum mobilisation fees received
 
 Lump sum mobilisation fees received on workover services contracts are deferred and recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the period that the related drilling and workover services are performed.
 
 Mobilisation costs incurred as part of a contract are deferred and recognised as an expense over the contract period. The 
costs of relocating drilling rigs that are not under a contract are expensed as incurred. 
 
(iii) Demobilisation fees received
 
 Demobilisation costs are costs related to the transfer of a drilling rig to a safe harbour or different geographical area and are 
expensed as incurred.
 
 Demobilisation fees on drilling and workover services contracts are recognised at the point in time when it becomes known 
and certain that demobilisation fee can be charged to the customer.
 
(iv) Sale of goods
 
 Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer. 
Revenue is recorded at net handling fee on basis that the Group have no ability to direct use of goods purchased.

(v) Rendering of services
 Revenue from services rendered is recognised net of service tax over time because the customer simultaneously receives and 
consumes the benefits provided to them. 
(vi) Rental income
 Rental income from operating leases are accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.
 
(vii) Interest income
 Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
 
(viii) Management fees
 Management fees are recognised when services are rendered. 
 
(ix) Dividend income
 Dividend income is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment is established. 
 
(n) Leases 
 The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
Group as a lessee 
 The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
(i)  Right-of-use assets
 
 The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available 
for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial 
direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of 
the assets, as follows:
Short-term leasehold land 50 years
Office premises 2 - 3 years
Motor vehicles 2 - 3 years
Warehouses 2 - 9 years
 
 If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 
option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
 The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment, and the policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses 
is in accordance with Note 2.2(p).

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(n) Leases (cont'd.)
Group as a lessee (cont'd.)
(ii)  Lease liabilities 
 
 At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments 
to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any 
lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid 
under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain 
to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising 
the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless 
they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. 
 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount 
of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the 
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) 
or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
(iii)  Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
 
 The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment (i.e., those 
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also 
applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low-value. 
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 
 Group as a lessor 
 
 Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are 
classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is 
included in other operating income in the statements of profit or loss due to its nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating 
and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term 
on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as income in the period in which they are earned.
(o) Employee benefits 
(i) Short term benefits
 
 Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which the 
associated services are rendered by employees. Short term accumulating compensated absences such as paid annual leave 
are recognised when services are rendered by employees that increase their entitlement to future compensated absences, and 
short term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occur.
(ii) Defined contribution plans
 
 Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into separate 
entities or funds and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if any of the funds do not hold 
sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee services in the current and preceding financial years. 
 As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the state pension scheme, the Employees Provident Fund. 
Some of the Group's foreign subsidiaries also make contributions to their respective countries' statutory pension schemes. The 
contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(p) Impairment of non-financial assets 
 The carrying amounts of assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated to determine 
the amount of impairment loss, if any.
 For the purpose of impairment assessment of these assets, the recoverable amount is determined on an individual asset basis unless 
the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. If this is the case, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. 
 An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. 
 Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU or groups of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to those units or groups of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or groups 
of units on a pro-rata basis. 
 An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises. 
 Impairment loss on goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. An impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is reversed if, 
and only if, there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment 
loss was recognised. The carrying amount of an asset other than goodwill is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided 
that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of impairment loss for an asset is recognised in profit or loss.
(q) Segment reporting 
 For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on nature of services which are managed by the 
respective segment managers responsible for the performance of the respective segments under their charge. The segment managers 
report directly to the Executive Director who regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and 
to assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 29, including the factors 
used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.    
(r) Fair value measurement 
 MFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement prescribed that fair value of an asset or a liability, except for lease transactions, is determined as 
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date. The measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the 
principal market or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
 Financial instruments 
 The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to quoted 
market bid prices at the close of business at the end of the reporting date. For financial instruments where there is no active market, fair 
value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference 
to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

2.2 Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
(s) Share capital  
 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group and the Company after deducting all 
of its liabilities. Ordinary shares are equity instruments. 
 Ordinary shares are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable incremental transaction costs. Ordinary shares are 
classified as equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are declared. 
(t) Share-based payments 
 Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees 
render services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions).  
 Equity-settled transactions 
 The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate 
valuation model, further details of which are given in Note 17(b). 
 That cost is recognised in employee benefits expense (Note 20), together with a corresponding increase in equity (share options 
reserves), over the period in which the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to 
which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The 
expense or credit in the statements of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the 
beginning and end of that period. 
 Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, 
but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments 
that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached 
to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions 
are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or 
performance conditions. 
 No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not 
been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the 
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. 
 
 When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the grant date fair value of the 
unmodified award, provided the original vesting terms of the award are met. An additional expense, measured as at the date of 
modification, is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is 
otherwise beneficial to the employee. Where an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any remaining element of 
the fair value of the award is expensed immediately through profit or loss.
 
 The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share 
(further details are given in Note 26).

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
 
 The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: 
 
(i) Deferred tax assets
 
 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unutilised tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and unabsorbed reinvestment allowances to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses, capital allowances and reinvestment allowances 
can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based 
on the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The amount of recognised and unrecognised 
tax losses, capital allowances and reinvestment allowances of the Group are as disclosed in Note 7.
(ii) Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment in subsidiaries
 
 In the previous financial year, the Group has recognised reversal of impairment losses in respect of property, plant and equipment.
 
 The Group carried out the impairment assessment based on value-in-use and fair value less costs to sell of the CGU to which the assets are 
allocated.
 
 Estimating the value-in-use requires the management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose 
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Fair value is obtained from valuation reports performed 
by independent professional valuers based on best information available. Significant estimate is involved in deriving the fair value as there 
are possible variations in the basis and assumptions used by the valuers. Further details of the impairment losses recognised are as disclosed 
in Note 4 and Note 5.
(iii) Useful lives and residual value of plant and equipment
 
 The cost of plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic useful lives after allowing for residual 
values. Management estimates the useful lives and residual values by applying assumptions and estimates that reflect both historical 
experience and expectations regarding future operations, rig utilisation and asset performance, and also based on the common life 
expectancies applied in the respective industries. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological developments could impact the 
economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount 
of the Group's plant and equipment at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 4.
(iv) Provision for expected credit losses ("ECLs") of trade receivables
 
 The Group uses simplified approach to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are based on various customer's historical 
observed default rates.
 
 The Group considers and assesses the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic 
conditions (i.e. gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults 
in the oil and gas sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated 
and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
 The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. 
The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group’s historical credit loss 
experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future. The information 
about the ECLs on the Group’s trade receivables is disclosed in Note 10.

 Whilst crude oil price has improved compared to the end of the previous financial year, the oil companies continue to be prudent with capital 
expenditure. During the financial year, certain subsidiaries of the Group within the drilling services segment, hydraulic workover operation and 
oilfield services segment carried out a review of the recoverable amounts of impairment of their property, plant and equipment.
 Recoverable amount determined based on value-in-use
 Included in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment is RM2,389.9 million (2022: RM2,376.4 million) relating to drilling services 
segment and hydraulic workover operations, of which was impaired in prior years. The recoverable amount of these assets are based on the value-
in-use of each asset, based on their respective cash flow projections discounted at 10.13%. No impairment loss were recorded in both financial 
year ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 respectively.
 Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU, taking into consideration the time value of money and 
individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. Adjustments to the discount rates are made to 
factor in the specific amount and timing of the future cash flows in order to reflect a pre-tax discount rate. 
 The calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the utilisation rates, time charter rates and discount rate assumptions. Any adverse change in the 
key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations would result in further impairment.

4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONT'D.)
 Recoverable amount determined based on fair value less costs to sell
 The fair value of certain building was determined based on the valuation performed by an independent valuer using the comparable approach. The 
fair value measurement is derived from inputs based on Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further details of the fair value hierarchy are disclosed 
in Note 32.
 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
 The only CGU where a reasonably possible change to certain key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying 
amount are the drilling rigs and HWUs CGU.
 The following changes in the key assumptions, in isolation, would lead to the sensitivity of the recoverable amount of the drilling rigs and HWUs.
Effect on recoverable amount
Increase/(decrease)

Drilling rigs
Discount rate - Increase by 0.1%  (19,468)
- Decrease by 0.1% 19,468 
HWUs
Discount rate - Increase by 0.5%  (256)
- Decrease by 0.5% 256 
 In relation to the recoverable amount determined based on fair value less costs to sell of certain building, if the fair value increase by 5%, the 
recoverable amount will increase by RM703,000.

 The Company performed an impairment review of its investments in certain subsidiaries, where the carrying amount of investments exceeded its 
recoverable amount in the respective subsidiaries at the reporting date. The review did not give rise to the recognition of allowance for impairment 
loss of investment in subsidiaries for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.
 Details of the subsidiaries are set out in Note 30.
 If recoverable amount increase of 5%, this will result in RM49,486,000 (2022: RM49,401,000) decrease in allowance for impairment loss of 
investment in subsidiaries.

 The unutilised tax losses, unabsorbed capital and reinvestment allowances of the Group are available for offsetting against future taxable profits of 
the respective subsidiaries within the Group, subject to no substantial changes in the shareholding of these subsidiaries under the Income Tax Act, 
1967. The Ministry of Finance via the Budget 2022 announced that the Government will limit the carrying forward of unutilised business losses 
and unabsorbed investment tax allowances up to a maximum of ten consecutive years of assessment, retrospectively from year of assessment in 
2019. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because there is uncertainty as to when the companies that have 
recent history of losses will be profitable and therefore, it is not probable that future taxable profits of the applicable Group entities will be sufficient 
to allow the benefits to be realised.

(a) Warrant reserve 
 On 25 October 2017, the Company allotted and issued 1,209,181,678 free warrants on the basis of 1 warrant for every 4 rights shares 
subscribed and 304,218,076 free warrants on the basis of 1 warrant for every 4 RCPS-i subscribed. 
 The warrants are valid for exercise for a period of 7 years from its issue date and will expire on 18 October 2024. During this period, each 
warrant entitled the registered holder to subscribe for 1 new ordinary share/RCPS-i in the Company at any time on or after 25 October 
2017 to 18 October 2024, at an exercise price of RM0.395 per warrant. Any warrant not exercised by its expiry date will lapse thereafter 
and cease to be valid for all purposes. During the financial year, no warrants for rights issue and RCPS-i were exercised. As at the reporting 
date, 1,209,181,678 warrants for rights issue and 304,218,076 warrants for RCPS-i remained unexercised. 
 The value allocated to 1 warrant was based on the proportion of the fair value of 1 warrant, being the fair value of the warrant on the first 
day of its listing, over the combined fair value of 4 rights shares/RCPS-i and 1 warrant to the issue price of the right shares of RM0.30 each.

17. OTHER RESERVES (CONT'D.)
(b) Share options reserve (cont'd.)
 At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 31 October 2019, shareholders approved the ESOS for the granting of non-transferable 
options to eligible senior executives and employees respectively. The ESOS has been implemented effective from 1 November 2019 and 
subsequently on 6 November 2023. Options are granted to the eligible employees employed on a full time basis at the discretion of the 
ESOS Committee. The key features of the ESOS are as follows: 
(i) The maximum number of new ordinary shares of the Company which may be allotted and issued pursuant to the options that may be 
granted under the ESOS shall not in aggregate exceed seven point five percent (7.5%) of the total number of issued ordinary shares 
of the Company;
(ii) The maximum number of options that may be granted under the ESOS to any one eligible person shall be at the sole and absolute 
discretion of the ESOS Committee after taking into consideration the position and performance of the eligible person in the Group, 
or such other factors which the ESOS Committee may in its absolute discretion deem fit, subject to the following:
- the eligible senior executives and other eligible employees do not participate in the deliberation or discussion in respect of 
his/her own allocation; and 
- the total number of Shares of the Company shall be allocated to any eligible person who, either individually or collectively 
through persons connected with such eligible person, holds twenty percent (20%) or more of the total number issued ordinary 
shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares, if any), does not exceed more than ten percent (10%) of the total number 
of Shares of the Company to be issued under the Scheme. 
(iii)  The option exercise price shall be determined by the Board upon recommendation of the ESOS Committee to be the five (5) days weighted 
average market price of the ordinary shares of the Company, as quoted on Bursa Securities, immediately preceding the date of offer or 
with a premium or discount. In the event of a discount, the discount shall not be more than ten percent (10%) or such other percentage 
of discount as may be permitted by Bursa Securities or any other relevant authorities from time to time during the duration of the ESOS; 
(iv)  The ESOS shall be in force for a duration of five (5) years from the effective date of implementation of the ESOS. The ESOS 
Committee may terminate the ESOS at any time before the Date of Expiry without obtaining the approvals from the Grantees who 
have yet to exercise their Options or the Company's shareholders provided that the Company releases an announcement to Bursa 
Securities on the following:
- the effective date of termination ("Termination Date"); 
- the number of Options exercised or Shares vested; and  
- the reasons and justification for termination. 
 
(v)  The ESOS is exercisable upon fulfilment of the vesting period of three (3) years, or earlier at the discretion of the ESOS Committee.

NOTES TO THE

17. OTHER RESERVES (CONT'D.)
(b) Share options reserve (cont'd.)
 Fair value of share options granted 
 The fair value of the share options granted under the ESOS is estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing 
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. 
 
 The following table lists the inputs to the option pricing model are as follows: 
 
Group and Company
Tranche 1 (Effective from 1 November 2019)
Fair value at the measurement date  RM0.18 
Expected volatility 50.67%
Risk-free interest rate 3.28% per annum
Expected life of option  5 years 
Share price  RM0.33 
Tranche 2 (Effective from 6 November 2023)
Fair value at the measurement date  RM0.16 
Expected volatility 69.59%
Risk-free interest rate 3.52% per annum
Expected life of option  5 years 
Share price  RM0.23 
 
 The expected life of the options is based on the ESOS duration and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of 
future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
(c) Capital reserve
 
Capital reserve relates to statutory reserves of an overseas subsidiary.
(d) Gain on derecognition of financial liabilities 
 The gain on derecognition of financial liabilities arose as part of the settlement of liabilities due to the former ultimate holding company 
pursuant to a past internal reorganisation. 
(e) Foreign currency translation reserve 
 The foreign currency translation reserve represents exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign 
operations whose functional currencies are different from the Group's presentation currency.

29. SEGMENT REPORTING
 For management purposes, the Group is organised into business segments based on the nature of services and has 4 operating segments as 
follows:
 
(i) The drilling services segment is principally involved in the provision of drilling services to the upstream oil and gas sector. This segment 
owns and operates several drilling rigs. The rigs are chartered out to oil majors for their exploration, development and production 
activities; 
(ii) The integrated services segment principally provide hydraulic workover operation. The hydraulic workover operation own HWUs and acts 
as an agent for two providers of specialised equipment and service. The HWUs service offshore wells that involve the use of HWUs and its 
ancillary equipment to complete the removal and replacement of well equipment to restore the operation of suspended or under-performing 
wells;
 
(iii) The oilfield services segment principally provide premium OCTG threading, repair and inspection services; and 
 
(iv) The others segment is involved in investment holding, provision of support services, management and corporate services which do not 
generate significant external revenue. 
 
 Transfer prices between operating segments are at terms agreed between the parties.
 
 With effect from 1 January 2022, the Group has segregated Workover Services and Oilfield Services as separate segment. Workover services 
was previously reported under the Oilfield Services segment. The Group has also introduced Integrated Services (now referred to as Integrated 
Project Management) segment which comprises Workover Services and Integrated Rig Drilling Completion ("i-RDC") Services.

32. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 Determination of fair values  
 
 Financial instruments that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximations 
of fair value 
 The following are classes of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of 
fair value: 
 
Note
Receivables
- Trade and other receivables 10 
- Due from subsidiaries 11 
Deposits, cash and bank balances 12 
Lease liabilities 8 
Borrowings
- Floating rate borrowings (non-current) 13 
- Floating rate borrowings (current) 14 
Payables
- Trade and other payables 15 
- Due to subsidiaries 11 
 
 The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities are reasonable approximation of fair value, either due to their short-term nature or that 
they are floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the reporting date.
 The carrying amounts of the current portion of loans and borrowings are reasonable approximation of fair value due to the insignificant impact of 
discounting. 
 The fair values of non-current loans and borrowings are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at market incremental lending rate for 
similar types of lending, borrowing or leasing arrangements at the reporting date.
 Fair value hierarchy 
 
 The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
(a) Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(b) Level 2 Input other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
(c) Level 3 Input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable input).
Level 1

in money market fund, are included in deriving net debt of the Group. The Group endeavours to maintain a gearing ratio to that optimises the usage 
of capital.

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT'D.)
Responsibilities of the Board Risk Management Committee include:      
      
(i) to monitor the consistent enforcement of Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") policy across the Group;      
(ii) to review and endorse the risk parameters, risk appetite, risk profiles, risk treatment options, risk action plans and key risk 
indicators;      
(iii) to provide guidance and advice on appropriateness of risk treatment option selected and risk action plans development; and
      
(iv) to provide half yearly reports to the Board on ERM.      
      
 The Risk Management Committee is made up of members of the Group's senior management. This committee will be responsible to identify and 
assess risks and make recommendations on risk management to the Board Risk Management Committee and the Board of Directors.      
 Financial risk management objectives of the Group are as follows:      
      
(i) to minimise exposure to all financial risks including interest, credit, liquidity and foreign currency exchange risks;      
(ii) to accept certain level of financial risks including price risk and credit risk that commensurate with the expected returns on the underlying 
operations and activities; and       
(iii) to minimise liquidity risk by proper cash flow planning, management and control.      
The Group's financial risk management strategies include using:      
      
(i) credit controls that include evaluation, acceptance, monitoring and feedback to ensure that only reasonably creditworthy customers are 
accepted; and
      
(ii) money market instruments, short term deposits and bank borrowings to manage liquidity risks.      
      
The Group's strategies and practices in dealing with its major financial risks are set out below:       
(a) Foreign currency risk      
      
 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign 
exchange rates.  The functional currency of a majority of the companies within the Group is United States Dollar ("USD"). The Group relies 
primarily on the natural hedge between its USD-denominated revenue and USD-denominated borrowings and other liabilities to minimise its 
exposures to foreign currency risk.      
      
 The Group's exposures to foreign currency risk primarily consist of trade receivables, trade payables, loans and borrowings, and deposits, 
cash and bank balances, as a result of transactions entered into in currencies other than the functional currencies.      
      
 As at 31 December 2023, approximately 1.7% (2022: 1.6%) of the Group’s trade receivables and approximately 11.5% (2022: 8.4%) 
of the Group's trade payables are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant companies in the Group.  
            
 The Group also holds deposits, cash and bank balances denominated in currencies other than functional currencies for working capital 
purposes. As at 31 December 2023, the Group has such balances amounting to RM9,309,027  (2022: RM19,731,252).  
 Material foreign currency exposures are hedged via foreign exchange contracts by using foreign exchange facilities maintained with 
leading banks. The foreign exchange contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item. It is the Group’s policy not to enter into 
foreign contracts until a firm commitment is in place.

(b) Interest rate risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because 
of changes in market interest rates.  
 The Group is exposed to interest  rate risk in respect of its placements with financial institutions and bank borrowings at floating rates. Its 
policy is to:
 (i)  have an optimal mixture of short term deposits or placements; and
 (ii) manage its interest cost using a combination of fixed and floating rate debts. 
 The Group monitors interest rates prior to making deposits and bank borrowings to ensure that the applicable rates are established at 
acceptable levels. Interest rate swaps may be used to hedge against fluctuation in interest rate where appropriate. 
 Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk  
 
 The table below demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's and the Company's profit/(loss) after taxation, to possible reasonable changes 
in interest rates with all other variables held constant, through impact on interest income from placement of surplus funds and interest expense

(c) Credit risk
 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligation. The Group's 
exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. For other financial assets (including deposits, cash and bank 
balances), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties. 
 
 Credit risk of the Group is managed during the tendering stage where the credit worthiness of a potential customer or the payment records 
of an existing customer is evaluated prior to participating in a tender. The Group's customers are mainly local and overseas national oil 
companies, subsidiaries of credit-worthy international oil and gas companies or established international companies. For less established 
companies, credit risk is managed by obtaining advance payment and/or a collateral in the form of a bank guarantee. 
 
 Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Company's trade receivables and accrued income:

 The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets disclosed in Note 10.
(d) Liquidity risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company is unable to meet financial obligations when due, as a result of  shortage of funds 
including arising from mismatch of maturities of financial assets and liabilities.   
 To ensure a healthy liquidity position, it is the Group's and the Company's policy to: 
 (i) have the right mixture of liquid assets in its portfolio;
 (ii) maintain a healthy gearing ratio;
 (iii) finance long term assets with long term loans; and
 (iv) maintain a balance between flexible and structured financing options to finance its operations and investments.
