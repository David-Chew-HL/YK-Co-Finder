MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN
Dear Valued Stakeholders,
We stepped into 2023 with cautious 
optimism. Our vigilance has served 
us well as the world economy 
continues to be unprecedentedly 
volatile. Sunway REIT is pleased 
that, in spite of the gyrations 
in economic activities, we have 
continued to deliver sustainable 
results to our unitholders. Steered 
by our TRANSCEND 2027 roadmap, 
we will continue to embark on 
strategies that will lead Sunway REIT 
to sustained growth.
TAN SRI AMIRSHAM BIN A AZIZ
Chairman
Sunway	REIT	Management	Sdn	Bhd
REFLECTING ON AN INCREASINGLY VOLATILE WORLD
In 2023, the global economy continued to face challenges following the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Coupled with heightened geopolitical tensions and strict monetary policies to tame inflation, these factors 
have contributed to the increased risk of a worldwide economic slowdown.
Forecast from the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) indicates a slowdown in global economic growth, with 
growth rates expected to decline from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and further to 2.9% in 2024. This represents 
a notable deterioration from the historical average growth of 3.8% seen from 2000 to 2019. Meanwhile, global 
inflation is projected to finally moderate, influenced by stricter monetary policies and a drop in international 
commodity prices. The moderation has given central banks like the Federal Reserve confidence to hint at a 
pivot from their monetary policies moving forward.
Despite the global uncertainties, Malaysia’s economy remained resilient. The economy has been anchored by 
domestic consumption, well-managed inflation, favourable labour market conditions and a healthy current 
account surplus. Nonetheless, higher interest rates and a weak Ringgit have caused vulnerabilities in certain 
industries. Meanwhile, Malaysia’s advance Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) expanded by 3.8% in 2023.

M-REITS RECOVERY STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
The Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts (“M-REITs”) recovery in 
2023 can be described as intermittent, mainly attributable to a climate 
of escalating interest rates. The year commenced strongly, with the 
M-REITs index rallying 7.5%, reaching its zenith in early February 2023. 
It was buoyed by the optimistic sentiment following China’s reopening 
and a temporary halt in Malaysia’s Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) 
increases. However, as the year progressed, the narrative was again 
dominated by the continuation of global monetary tightening policies. 
The sentiment was further dampened by lower-than-expected tourist 
arrivals. 
Despite the lacklustre M-REITs sentiment, market capitalisation 
expanded by 7.0% to RM41.8 billion in 2023 by active acquisition 
activities, which are mainly from the respective sponsors and equity 
fundraisings. For the year, M-REITs recorded a marginal contraction 
of  1.2%.
The distribution yield of M-REITs, which stood at 6.7% at the end of 
2022, saw a compression in 2023 to 6.2%. Total returns for M-REITs 
improved marginally from the previous year’s 4.5% to 5.0% in 2023, 
suggesting a cautious approach from investors amidst a higher 
interest rate environment. Furthermore, the average discount-to-Net 
Asset Value (“NAV”) for M-REITs widened slightly from 22% (as of 31 
December 2022) to 23% (as of 31 December 2023), illustrating the 
impact of declining unit prices.
Sunway REIT’s trading performance showed notable improvement in 
2023. The unit price rebounded by 13.6% between the start of 2023 
and early February, reaching a high of RM1.66, but closed the year at 
RM1.54, up 5.5% from RM1.46 at the end of 2022. 
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, Sunway REIT has 
maintained payment of 100% of its distributable realised profit for the 
year (excluding gain on disposal) and declared a dividend per unit of 
9.30 sen. Even though dividend yield has declined marginally to 6.0% 
from 6.3% in FY2022, total return has nonetheless improved to 11.5% 
compared to 9.8% in the previous year. Meanwhile, Sunway REIT’s 
premium-to-NAV also improved to 5.1% as of 31 December 2023, as 
opposed to a discount-to-NAV of 0.3% in the previous year. 
The above is commendable, considering the subdued sentiment for 
M-REITs, persistently high interest rates, and Sunway REIT’s exclusion 
from the FTSE Bursa Malaysia Emas Index and FTSE4 Good Bursa 
Malaysia Index. The exclusion of Sunway REIT from these indices was 
due to low trading liquidity, in line with decreased investor interest in 
M-REITs.

MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN
PLANNING FOR A HIGHER-FOR-LONGER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT
Challenges abound for the year ahead, chief of which will be the expected higher-for-longer interest rates, especially in 
Malaysia. Even as developed countries explore a potential reversal of the interest rate policy, loosening monetary policy may 
take place later rather than earlier in Malaysia as Bank Negara Malaysia (“BNM”) has been much more measured in hiking 
rates. Oversupply of office and retail space, especially in Klang Valley, may also potentially restrict growth in these two sectors.
Nonetheless, there are also reasons to be optimistic for the coming year. Malaysia’s robust economic fundamentals, reinforced 
by the strategies in Budget 2024, are expected to sustain economic growth within an estimated range of 4% to 5%. In 
particular, segments like retail trade, accommodation, restaurants and communications are expected to improve. At the same 
time, trade-related activities will likely boost the wholesale trade as well as transport and storage subsectors.
At a more granular level, initiatives by the government in reinstating flight frequency and connectivity, as well as granting the 
30-day visa-free status for citizens of China and India, augur well for the continued recovery of the tourism sector. Efforts to 
improve relations and connectivity between Singapore and Johor are also bearing fruit as the state has attracted great investor 
interest over recent months, with more foreign direct investments anticipated across the country due to the improved bilateral 
relations.
In benchmarking our ESG practices to other international property players, 
Sunway REIT had also submitted for our inaugural Global Real Estate 
Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) assessment and received a three-star 
rating in the category of Standing Investments and was rated “A” for our 
public disclosure. GRESB real estate assessment is the pre-eminent ESG 
benchmarking tool for real estate investments, providing standardised and 
validated data to the capital markets and investors. Sunway REIT is among 
the pioneers in the Malaysian real estate industry to submit for a GRESB 
assessment rating as we seek to break new ground in sustainability practices 
and bring Sunway REIT to match the ESG standards of worldwide peers.
The culmination of Sunway REIT’s efforts in ESG has resulted in various 
recognition and accreditation. Notably, in 2023, Sunway REIT had leapt from 
a “BB” to an “A” MSCI ESG rating in August 2023, achieving a two-notch 
improvement and underscoring its proactive management of financially 
relevant ESG risks and opportunities. MSCI ESG rating assessment is widely 
embraced as a critical decision support tool in capital markets worldwide and 
aims to measure a company’s resilience to long-term ESG risks.
ACCELERATING SUSTAINABILITY AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
The shift towards incorporating Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) criteria within investment and 
business decisions gained further traction in 2023. The movement is largely driven by institutional and international 
capital demands and, within the real estate space, is increasingly resonating with the requirements of occupiers 
and tenants. This trend is in line with Sunway REIT’s continuous effort to deepen and broaden its ESG best 
practices, emphasising sustainable strategies and responsible business activities.
    Please	refer	to	the	In	Conversation	with	Our	CEO	section	and	the	Sustainability	Report	for	progress	and	details	of	Sunway	REIT’s	sustainability	initiatives.	
PURSUING SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM GROWTH THROUGH TRANSCEND 2027
Consistent with the above macroeconomic outlook, Sunway REIT will remain opportunistic in looking out for assets that 
align with TRANSCEND 2027, increasing our exposure to industrial, services and logistics sub-sectors, which shall support 
the nation’s growth aspirations as well as provide us with resilient earnings moving forward. Given the volatile interest rate 
movements, there could also be arbitrage opportunities in overseas markets, and we will look to capitalise on any such 
opportunities, especially in the developed economies. 
We will also maintain regular engagement with Sunway REIT’s sponsor to monitor the progress and readiness of pipeline 
assets to be injected into Sunway REIT as we aspire to achieve the long-term goal of at least RM14 billion of Assets Under 
Management (“AUM”). Organically, we are also monitoring our substantial Asset Enhancement Initiatives (“AEI”) and 
development works in progress. During the year, we have approved and commenced contract works of approximately  
RM1 billion to be undertaken over the next two to three years. These AEIs are expected to be yield-accretive to our portfolio 
of assets and shall provide the next level of growth for Sunway REIT.

IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR CEO
Dear Valued Stakeholders, 
It gives me immense pleasure to 
present my inaugural CEO message 
in Sunway REIT’s Integrated Annual 
Report for FY2023. It has been a 
great honour to be entrusted with the 
responsibility of leading Sunway REIT 
forward to our next phase of growth. 
Since my appointment in July 2023,  
I am delighted to share that Sunway REIT 
has continued to sustain its financial 
performance amidst a challenging 
economic backdrop and has pushed on 
with a number of strategic acquisitions  
and Asset Enhancement Initiatives 
(“AEI”) which will certainly enhance 
our prospects moving forward.

NAVIGATING UNCERTAINTY  IN THE FACE OF RISING TIDES
As we stepped into 2023 with trepidation, facing dual headwinds in the form of soaring 
inflation and persistent monetary tightening by key central banks across the world, 
Sunway REIT is relieved by the disciplined and pragmatic monetary policy adopted 
by Bank Negara Malaysia (“BNM”). While keeping up with general interest rate 
trends worldwide, BNM’s gradual and measured approach to increasing rates ensured 
inflation was kept in check while businesses and households had time to manage the 
increase in financing costs. Coupled with strong policies by an increasingly stable 
government, Malaysia’s economy remained resilient, anchored by strong domestic 
demand. This was crucial to Sunway REIT being able to sustain our performance as 
the world economy remains in a state of flux with new geopolitical risks emerging and 
the boost from a surge in tourist arrivals following the re-opening of China borders not 
quite materialising.

RESILIENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR FY2023
Amidst the abovementioned backdrop, Sunway REIT sustained its strong post-pandemic recovery in FY2023. The retail 
segment continued to grow commendably, anchored by the continuing increase in retail footfall, healthy retail sales, and 
boosted by Sunway Carnival Mall New Wing’s full-year contribution. The hotel segment, while still not entirely recovered 
to its pre-pandemic level, continues to demonstrate improvement in performance. The average occupancy rate for the 
hotel segment increased from 54% in FY2022 to 64% in FY2023 (FY2019: 69%). Other segments remained relatively stable 
contributors to Net Property Income (“NPI”). 
For FY2023, Sunway REIT registered revenue of RM716 million, which is an improvement of 10% from RM651 million recorded 
in FY2022. However, NPI grew at a smaller rate of 5%, hampered by higher interest cost and a RM51 million increase in 
electricity charges following from the introduction of Imbalance Cost Pass Through (“ICPT”) by Tenaga Nasional Berhad. This 
itself has a 1.5 sen impact on Distribution Per Unit (“DPU”). Despite that, the Manager still was able to increase DPU to 9.30 
sen for FY2023 from 9.22 sen in the previous financial year. Moving forward, we anticipate the completion of the various AEIs 
to drive DPU growth further.

ENHANCING VALUE THROUGH ACTIVE ASSET ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES
Sunway REIT proactively identifies opportunities to improve the operational performance of our portfolio’s existing assets. 
This is particularly important to maintain the relevance of our assets and preserve or enhance the property values in a fiercely 
competitive real estate market.
Ongoing and pipeline AEIs and brownfield developments are as follows:
Refreshing Sunway Carnival Mall’s Existing Wing
Trailblazing Urban Rejuvenation at Sunway Pier
Following the successful launch of Sunway Carnival Mall – New Wing in June 
2022, Sunway REIT embarked on the refurbishment of the existing wing 
at Sunway Carnival Mall. We see enormous prospects in catering to the 
burgeoning demand from the growing population in Mainland Penang. The 
RM360 million refurbishment exercise encompasses optimising the layout, 
integrating the aesthetics of the external façade, and providing seamless 
connectivity for the enlarged mall. The AEI is being carried out in phases 
involving sectional closures from July 2023 through to third quarter 2025.
In line with previous stated plans to rejuvenate Sunway Pier, Sunway REIT has 
in FY2023, obtained development approvals for the redevelopment of the site 
into a tourist destination and a new seaside landmark in Selangor. With the ferry 
terminal connecting it to neighbouring countries and the adjacent KTM Komuter 
rail link to the heart of the city, this urban rejuvenation project aspires to bring 
unique offerings and experiences in retail, leisure, travel and gastronomy. The 
development project is expected to begin in 2024 at a cost of RM370 million and 
targeted for completion in 2027.
Curating Better Tenant Mix and Optimising Space at Sunway Pyramid Mall
Sunway Pyramid Mall, our jewel asset, has demonstrated resilience over the years due 
to its foresight to evolve in tandem with changing consumers trends and lifestyles. As 
the next phase of its evolution, the mall is reconfiguring 320,000 square feet of anchor 
tenant space, previously occupied by the AEON departmental store, into specialty 
stores. The reconfiguration aims to improve and revitalise the tenancy mix and further 
elevate shopping experience in the mall. We are optimistic that a well-curated tenancy 
mix would attract a broader range of shoppers, thus increasing retail footfall and 
revenue. 
This AEI is essential for two purposes. Firstly, it serves to defend its position as one of the leading regional malls in 
the face of intensifying competition in the Klang Valley from new openings like The Exchange at TRX and Pavilion 
Damansara Heights. Secondly, the reconfigured retail space is expected to generate higher rents per square foot 
compared to the previous anchor tenant, thus, enhancing the asset yield of the property.  The AEI at Sunway 
Pyramid Mall is expected to complete in the final quarter of 2024 with a budget of RM190 million.

ENJOYING THE RESURGENCE OF TOURISM AND FRUIT OF AEI EFFORTS
Sunway REIT fully completed the transformative refurbishment of the Sunway Resort Hotel in July 2023, after the phased 
reopening since May 2022. The brand-new flagship hotel offers an exhilarating combination of world-class facilities and 
gastronomical offerings to elevate guests’ experience. Following the success of the first in Malaysia Gordon Ramsay Bar 
& Grill, the hotel welcomed another coveted New York City burger joint, Black Tap Craft Burgers & Shakes. The timely 
completion of the refurbishment of the 460 rooms and facilities also placed the hotel in strong position to capitalise on a 
recovery in leisure tourism and Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (“MICE”) activities. As a result, Sunway 
Resort Hotel recorded a significant increase of 67% in its Average Daily Rate (“ADR”) compared to pre-pandemic. 
Equally significant was the halo effect created from the success of Sunway Resort Hotel for our two other hospitality assets in 
the vicinity, Sunway Lagoon Hotel and Sunway Pyramid Hotel. Both properties had also recorded strong occupancies above
70% for FY2023 and achieved an increase of 16% in ADR compared to pre-pandemic.   
While Malaysia’s tourism recovery has lagged those of its neighbouring countries, we nevertheless anticipate a steady upward 
trend in 2024. Measures to allow 30-day visa-free entry to Chinese and Indian nationals and improving flight connectivity and 
frequency augur well for the hospitality industry in Malaysia as a whole.
PORTFOLIO REBALANCING TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH
In driving Sunway REIT towards higher future growth, we focused our key priorities on optimising the portfolio to build 
portfolio resilience and generating higher growth. In 2023, Sunway REIT implemented key measures in rebalancing our 
asset portfolio, namely, expanding our geographical presence within Malaysia, strengthening our industrial segment and 
completed one asset recycling.
Sunway REIT announced the proposed acquisition of a portfolio of 6 hypermarkets 
in March 2023 for a total purchase consideration of RM520 million. These assets 
fortify our presence in the Klang Valley, as well as spread our foothold into Johor. 
Our maiden presence in Johor is expected to benefit from Johor’s rapidly recovering 
economy and growing connectivity to Singapore. Geographical diversification aside, 
the proposed acquisition enhances income resilience and NPI yield of Sunway REIT’s 
asset portfolio. A conditional approval was received from Economic Planning Unit of 
the Prime Minister’s Office and the Board of Directors of the Manager is reviewing 
the said condition for the next course of action which will be updated in due course.
On 26 January 2024, Sunway REIT entered into a conditional Sale and Purchase 
Agreement (“SPA”) with D’Kiara Place Sdn. Bhd., to acquire a shopping mall known 
as “163 Retail Park” that is strategically located in Mont Kiara, Kuala Lumpur for a 
cash consideration of RM215 million.
Sunway REIT continues to build up the strength of its industrial segment. During 
FY2023, Sunway REIT capitalised on an opportunity to acquire an asset in Bukit 
Tengah Industrial Park, Prai, Penang, a leading industrial hub in Malaysia. Sunway 
REIT signed a conditional SPA in December 2023 to acquire the industrial property 
for a purchase consideration of RM66.8 million. This move is in line with Sunway 
REIT’s strategic vision to bolster our presence in the industrial segment.
This acquisition will mark the addition of a third industrial asset to Sunway REIT’s asset 
portfolio, bringing the combined property value to approximately RM234 million. The 
Services, Industrial  and Others segments will represent approximately 9.0% of Sunway 
REIT’s asset portfolio upon the completion of the proposed acquisition. Sunway REIT 
Industrial - Petaling Jaya 1 has also been successfully partially leased with approximately 
86,000 square feet or 27% of the space taken by ABB, a Swedish electrical technology 
company. The remaining space has continued to attract strong interest from prospective 
tenants and we foresee occupancy increasing further in FY2024.

Sunway REIT completed the divestment of Sunway Medical Centre (Tower A & B) in 
August 2023 and in the process made realised gains of RM60 million and generated 
net cash of RM430 million. We are looking to redirect the proceeds towards assets 
that will enhance the portfolio yield and generate higher accretion to DPU.

DYNAMIC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Faced with a rising interest rate environment, Sunway REIT was vigilant in monitoring interest rate movements and focused on 
optimising its financing costs and capital structure. Through a dynamic capital management strategy, Sunway REIT managed 
to maintain a healthy debt profile with a weighted debt expiry of 1.3 years while maintaining an optimal proportion of 
34%:66% between  fixed and floating rate borrowings. The average cost of debt increased from 2.98% in FY2022 to 3.80% in 
FY2023, reflecting the full impact of a 125 basis points interest rate increase since May 2022 and a “quasi tightening” in July 
and December 2023. Notwithstanding the higher interest rate landscape, Sunway REIT continued to have one of the lowest 
cost of debt amongst M-REITs.
As part of plans to further optimise its debt capital, Sunway REIT embarked on a rating process with RAM Rating Services 
Berhad in FY2023 and in September 2023, secured a corporate credit rating of AA2. This was a significant achievement in 
that Sunway REIT is the first in the M-REIT industry to obtain its own corporate credit rating. RAM Ratings had, concurrently, 
also ascribed an A1(s) rating for Sunway REIT’s Perpetual Note programme. These ratings are testament to Sunway REIT’s 
strong credit profile and will enable Sunway REIT to attract a wider pool of investors and potentially achieve better cost 
efficiency for debt issuances under its Medium Term Note and Perpetual Note programmes going forward. 
    Please refer to the Capital Management section for the detailed explanation.
RAISING THE BAR FOR SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES 
With Sustainability or Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations gaining even greater prominence for 
stakeholders in FY2023, Sunway REIT is pleased that our industry leading efforts have been recognised by various bodies as 
we continue to trailblaze in terms of our sustainability initiatives.
IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR CEO
Besides the conferment of GreenRE Platinum status for Sunway Resort Hotel, Sunway REIT also 
obtained a GreenRE Gold status for Sunway Putra Mall. With this new certification, five Sunway 
REIT properties representing 35% of our total gross floor area managed is now green certified. 
Sunway REIT has laid out a 10-year roadmap with the intention to green certify all our buildings 
before 2034. The continued pursuit of green certifications for our buildings is dual purpose. Firstly, 
we aim to ensure the continued relevance of Sunway REIT properties for choice tenants as more 
corporations look to control their Scope 3 emissions. Secondly, we believe that energy audits and 
equipment enhancements during the certification process will lead to energy consumption savings 
and operational expenditure reduction.
Following the completion of the refurbishment of Sunway Resort Hotel in July 2023, the flagship 
hotel in Sunway REIT’s portfolio was officially accredited as a GreenRE Platinum Building, the highest 
recognition by GreenRE under their GreenRE Existing Non-Residential Building rating tool. Sunway 
Resort Hotel’s refurbishment, costing approximately RM300 million, incorporated green features like an 
intelligently designed building facade to reduce heat gains, energy-efficient air conditioning systems, 
optimised natural ventilation, and innovative water management strategies utilising alternative water 
source to reduce potable water for hotel operational use. As the first GreenRE Platinum - certified 
hotel in Malaysia, Sunway Resort Hotel solidifies its position as a pioneer in sustainable hospitality.

Roadmap
Partnering HSBC Bank, Sunway REIT continued to lead the way in green financing initiatives. Sunway 
REIT and HSBC inked the first sustainability linked Cross Currency Swap in Malaysia worth RM200 
million in April 2023. The bespoke CCS offers direct sustainability-related incentives while hedging 
the currency and interest rate risks of Sunway REIT’s foreign currency loan with HSBC. As at end 
FY2023, 97.5% of Sunway REIT’s borrowings are on sustainable financing.
