OUR COMPANY
ABou T  As TRo M A lAy si A  Holdi NG s Be RHA d
Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad is a leading integrated consumer 
media entertainment group in Malaysia and Southeast Asia with 
operations in 4 key areas of business, namely pay-TV, Radio, 
Publications and Digital Media.
With a customer base of over 3.5 million residential customers 
or approximately 52% penetration of Malaysian TV households, 
Astro offers 170 TV channels, including 71 Astro-created and 
branded channels, and over 30 HD channels, delivered via DTH 
satellite TV, IPTV and OTT platforms. Astro provides HD, 3D, 
PVR, VOD and IPTV services through Astro B.yond and Astro 
On-The-Go. Fulfilling its promise to bridge the digital divide for 
all of Malaysia, Astro has introduced NJOI as the country’s first 
non-subscription based satellite TV service, offering 19 TV and 20 
radio channels.
Astro has developed strong in-house production capabilities. 
We are the leading producer of vernacular content catering to 
the multi-ethic and multi-lingual communities in Malaysia. We 
produce close to 9,000 hours of content annually in multiple 
genres, creating strong vernacular content IPs and iconic brands, 
which are dominating the comedy, Islamic, edu-tainment and 
Hokkien content space. 
Astro Radio includes Malaysia’s highest rated stations across 
key languages and is available on both terrestrial and digital 
channels, reaching approximately 12.3 million weekly listeners 
and capturing a 51% share of listenership in Malaysia. Astro also 
publishes entertainment and lifestyle magazines and its digital 
arm is involved in digital publishing, applications and platforms.
Astro holds the distinction of the “Gold” award in the Media 
and Entertainment category at the Putra Brand Awards for 4 
consecutive years from 2010 to 2013, including the “Brand of 
the Year” award in 2012 and the “Brand Icon” award in 2013. 
These awards are in recognition of Astro’s efforts to exemplify 
innovation, quality and strong corporate responsibilities.

Dear Shareholders,
It is my pleasure and privilege to 
present the inaugural Annual Report of 
Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad for the 
financial year ended 31 January 2013. 
We have achieved many outstanding 
milestones this year and reaffirmed our 
status as the leading integrated consumer 
media entertainment group in Malaysia.
Strong Results & Dividends
Astro delivered a strong performance in 
2012 where our total revenue grew 10% to 
RM4.3 billion. We achieved customer 
growth of 418,000, increasing our total 
customer base to 3.5 million and overall 
TV household penetration rate to 52%. 
Our ARPU increased to RM93.20, an uplift 
of over RM4 from 2011, underpinned by 
the high take-up of our value-added 
products and services. We also achieved 
9% adex growth which surpassed the 
industry growth rate.
We reiterated our commitment to deliver 
total returns to our shareholders when we 
started paying quarterly dividends in the 
third quarter of 2012, two quarters earlier 
than what was articulated during the IPO 
process. The Board of Directors is also 
pleased to recommend for shareholders’ 
approval at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting a final dividend of 1.0 
sen per share in respect of the financial 
year ended 31 January 2013. This equals 
a healthy payout of 4 sen per share for 
owning Astro shares less than two quarters. 
With our strong growth momentum, high 
visibility on costs, particularly content cost, 
coupled with our highly cash generative 
business, we are well positioned to adopt 
a progressive dividend policy going 
forward.
Successful IPO
A significant milestone in the history of the 
company was achieved on 19 October 
2012 as we witnessed the successful 
completion of our IPO and the admission of 
our shares to the Official List of the Main 
Market of the Bursa Securities. The IPO 
received strong demand from the investing 
community, both locally and outside 
Malaysia. Our public portion under the 
retail offering was more than 6 times over-
subscribed, and the institutional portion, 
excluding the MITI offering and cornerstone 
allocation, was over-subscribed by more 
than 30 times. The total proceeds from the 
IPO were approximately RM4.5 billion, of 
which the amount raised by Astro was 
approximately RM1.4 billion. Such an 
overwhelming response is a clear reflection 
of the investing community’s trust and 
confidence in our company, as well as in 
Malaysia as an attractive destination for 
investment.
On behalf of Astro, I would like to express 
our sincere gratitude to all parties involved 
– in particular, our shareholders, fellow 
members of the Board of Directors, the 
management and the employees of Astro

who had worked tirelessly over a long period of time to ensure a 
successful IPO. In addition, we would also like to express our 
appreciation for the cooperation of the various organisations – 
the Securities Commission, the Ministry of Information, 
Communications and Culture, the Ministry of Finance, MITI, the 
MCMC, and last but not least, Bursa Securities, for playing a 
significant role in the IPO process.
Positive contribution to the Malaysian economy
Since Astro commenced its pay-TV service in 1996, we have come 
a long way to become one of Malaysia’s most loved and 
recognisable brands, providing entertainment of different genres 
across multiple platforms and employing approximately 4,500 
employees. In the course of our operations, we collaborate with 
more than 13,000 local small medium enterprises (SMEs), provide 
advertising space for more than 1,000 corporate advertisers, 
enhance the value proposition of more than 16,000 commercial 
establishments and generate some RM50 million of incremental 
revenue for the local movie industry via our Astro First and Astro 
Shaw offerings. We believe that our business activities have also 
had a positive impact on the wider Malaysian economy. Based on 
2012 statistics, it is estimated that we contributed close to RM4.6 
billion to the country’s GDP.
We are encouraged that our 
business activities have had a 
positive impact on the wider 
Malaysian economy.

Enriching the nation
Through our rich content IP in local sports, news and education, we 
provide Malaysian households with access to events of national 
interest as well as knowledge-based and educational content. 
Through Astro Arena, virtually the “largest stadium” serving millions 
of seat capacity, we broadcast live coverage of local sports. We 
also have our very own 24/7 news channel, Astro Awani, which 
comprehensively provides the latest domestic and international 
news to our subscribers. We have also created our own set of 
educational IPs which are available in a 360° manner via TV, radio, 
print and online. The success and relevance of these educational 
IPs is reinforced by the fact that their viewership is a multiple of 
the number of exam taking students in Malaysia. 
With the launch of NJOI, our non-subscription based DTH satellite 
TV service in 2012, we also have the potential to reach out to the 
vast majority of households, nationwide. This service enables us to 
provide a multi-channel TV and radio offering to the less affluent 
households in Malaysia, enriching the lives of all Malaysians every 
single day. In order to assist underprivileged communities to take 
advantage of this offering, Astro collaborated with eKasih, the 
centralised Malaysian poverty databank and the MCMC to commit 
to contributing STBs, at no cost, to c.50,000 households across 
Malaysia.
Awards and recognition
One of our key principles is to embed excellence in everything that 
we do. Over the years, this dedication to excellence has resulted in 
us receiving numerous local and international awards in recognition 
of our successful content production and the talent we have 
developed. For example, in the recent Anugerah Bintang Popular 
2012, Astro’s talent swept top awards in the categories of male 
singer, male actor, male comedy artiste and male TV host. We 
were awarded the people’s choice, “Brand of the Year” award at 
the 2012 Malaysia’s Putra Brand Awards and more recently, the 
“Brand Icon” award at the 2013 Malaysia’s Putra Brand Awards. 
Astro has also been recognised as one of the top employers of 
choice in the country, and has twice won the Graduate Employer 
of Choice in the Media and Broadcasting Industry, in 2011 and 
2012. We have also been recognised for our strong corporate social 
responsibilities, picking up the Silver Stevie in the Corporate Social 
Responsibility Program of the Year 2012 in the Asia, Australia and 
New Zealand category.

Responsibility to stakeholders
The Board is committed to upholding and implementing the highest standards of corporate 
governance and international best practices throughout the length and breadth of our 
businesses. Details of our corporate governance initiatives, risk management and internal 
controls are detailed in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.
Whilst we work hard to drive a healthy profit, we also constantly recognise the need to 
balance this with our responsibility to our stakeholders. Our corporate responsibilities 
encompass the four areas of marketplace, workplace, community and environment. As a 
broadcaster and content creator, we are cognisant of our responsibility to ensure not just a 
wide choice of content for our diverse audience, but also to ensure that our content is 
wholesome, educational, entertaining as well as compliant with local regulations. We have 
established a strict Code of Business Ethics to govern our dealings with our business partners. 
At the workplace, we are committed to creating a working environment where our employees 
will flourish. In addition to offering competitive rewards and benefits to attract and retain the 
best talent, we put heavy emphasis on their training and development to deliver a dynamic 
and progressive work space. We have also put in place a Safety and Health Policy which goes 
beyond complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 to ensure safe working 
We completed the construction of 2 Astro hostels in 
the remote regions of Sabah and Sarawak which 
enabled young schoolchildren who would normally

conditions for our employees. We are also constantly mindful of the 
environmental impact our business operations may have. In order to 
ensure that the environment is put on the forefront of our day-to-day 
activities, we have implemented environmental management systems 
which comply to the International Organisation for Standardisation 
(“ISO”) 14001 standards. 
Engaging with the wider community
We remain steadfast to our firm commitment to give back to the society. 
To this end, we have established Astro Kasih, an employee volunteer 
programme, which has resulted in more than 4,000 employees contributing 
more than 67,000 hours of work on community projects across Malaysia 
under the 4 pillars of Lifelong Learning, Sports & Wellness, Community 
Development and Environment. We have also provided opportunities by 
giving scholarships to worthy young students to pursue their educational 
ambitions at local or foreign institutions. To date, we have disbursed over 

---- Page 13 ----

RM15 million to 42 young scholars studying at home and abroad. 
We have also spent more than RM30 million to equip over 9,800 
schools and teacher activity centres with Astro services, flatscreen 
TVs and STBs benefitting 5.3 million students and 400,000 teachers. 
We completed the construction of 2 Astro hostels in the remote 
regions of Sabah and Sarawak which enabled young schoolchildren 
who would normally have to walk for several hours a day to attend 
classes, to lodge closer to their schools. Together with educational 
workshops that are provided, these schools have since recorded 
significant improvement in their academic results. Astro Kasih is 
also committed in promoting ecotourism among Malaysians. Our 
Beautiful Malaysia initiative demonstrates our ongoing commitment 
to marine conservation. In 2011, we broke the Malaysia Book of 
Records for the most corals transplanted and we continued the 
effort this year whereby we created greater awareness on marine 
conservation by setting the Guinness World Records™ title for the 
Longest 
u
nderwater Cleanup at the Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine 
Park in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah which was held from 6 – 13 April 
2013.
Acknowledgements
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all our stakeholders who have contributed to 
the progress and performance of Astro. I would also like to applaud 
all Astro staff for their hard work, professional resolute commitment 
and Go Beyond spirit on the continuing success of the company. 
To my fellow Directors, thank you for your invaluable support and 
wise counsel throughout the year. My sincere thanks as well to all 
our customers, business partners, governmental and regulatory 
agencies and of course, you our shareholders, whose support is 
crucial as we embark on a new chapter in our company’s history.

2012 saw the company executing strongly against our key strategic 
imperatives and to better serve our customers. This resulted in revenue 
growth of 10% to RM4.3 billion in 2012, underpinned by the growth in 
our customer base, as well as the increasing take-up of our value-added 
products and services. 
Our radio business reaffirmed its position as Malaysia’s number 1 radio 
operator; with top rated stations across all 4 languages, commanding an 
industry leading 53% share of the radio advertising market.
Astro’s adex performance continued to outperform the industry’s growth 
rate of 5%, growing at 9% to RM503 million (2011: RM461 million). This 
is driven by our increasing reach and relevance to advertisers given 
higher TV viewership and radio listenership.
Investments in Products and Platforms
As a progressive consumer media and entertainment group, Astro 
commits to innovate and evolve to be ready for new opportunities and 
to deliver a best-in-class customer experience. 
During the year, we focused on developing our systems and platforms 
to improve customer experience and operational efficiency. We continue 
to invest in an IT and CRM transformation programme that has added 
scalability, flexibility, customer analytics and intelligence to support our 
rapidly growing business. We also focused on improving uplink rain fade 
using signal level monitoring and automated antenna switching, thus 
achieving 99.9935% service availability.

Our Astro B.yond platform underpins our transition from being primarily 
a subscription DTH business to a multi-platform media business with 
subscription, non-subscription and discretionary content services, in the 
home and on the go. We are currently in the midst of migrating our 
existing customers onto the Astro B.yond platform which we target to 
complete by January 2014. This entails swapping out legacy STBs with 
the latest generation Astro B.yond “tri-brid” boxes capable of supporting 
DTH, IPTV and OTT content delivery; as well as HD, PVR and VOD for 
an enhanced viewing experience. This will impact our margins in 2012 
and 2013 but is expected to normalise immediately thereafter. We 
believe that this reinvestment phase will set the stage for us to drive 
growth in earnings. Our Astro B.yond STBs also come equipped with 
better conditional access systems to enhance the security of our 
intellectual property, and ensure we continue to be paid for our products 
and services.
Through Astro Digital, we have built strong online offerings that bring 
our content to the digital space. We have several dedicated web portals 
which focus on key content genres such as our one-stop sports portal, 
Stadium Astro, which registered 780,000 unique visitors and 100,000 
downloads of its mobile app during the year. We believe our digital 
services will immediately enhance customer engagement, raise our 
relevance to advertisers, and set the stage for future monetisation.

annual report 2013
Since 2009, we have upgraded our production and playout 
facilities to be fully HD-compatible in order to meet the steadily 
increasing demand for HD content. We now have HD production 
facilities comprising three HD production studios and two HD 
outside-broadcast production vehicles to support our multi genre 
local production needs.
We expanded our multi-lingual subtitling and voice over 
capabilities. To enhance our customers’ viewing experience, we 
introduced closed caption subtitles on all international HD 
channels and initiated the dubbing of international content such 
as Smurfs on HBO and Ben 10 on Cartoon Network, into Bahasa 
Malaysia, using the voices of Astro’s local talent. 
As at January 2013, we broadcast 164 channels, of which 71 are 
Astro-branded. We expect to take delivery of an additional 18 
transponders on the MEASAT-3b satellite early next year. These 
transponders, to be delivered over a 3-year period, will double 
our broadcast capacity and operational redundancy, and increase 
our capability to provide additional HD, SD and VOD programming. 
Growing relevance in content
Astro continues to bring our customers the best of local, regional 
and international content. We are committed to providing the 
best viewing experience to our 3.5 million and growing customer 
base, embracing all content windows, be it live sports and events, 
first window movies through Astro First and Astro Best, as well 
as an increasingly comprehensive VOD library for our customers. 
Following the success of Astro First (local movies available 2 
weeks after cinema release), we launched Astro Best (Hollywood 
and Asian movies available 3 months after cinema release) in 
stunning HD in August 2012. Since launch, Astro First and Astro 
Best have recorded over 6 million “purchases”. 
We are committed to local and localised content. During the 
past year, we witnessed the growth in local production hours to 
c.9,000 (2011: 8,000 hours). To date, we have produced over 
49,000 hours of content, making us a key IP owner in multiple 
genres; including comedy, education and general entertainment. 
Our signature content has generated strong customer acquisitions 
and advertising revenues. Our self-produced popular comedy 
programme, Maharaja Lawak, saw a new phenomenon of a 
mass local content franchise becoming premium, playing a key 
role in the increased subscription of our Mustika pack by 43% to 
1.1 million in 2012.
We successfully renewed all key content contracts including the 
Barclays Premier League (three seasons 2013/16), Disney and TVB. 
We also continue to build regional relationships, sourcing content 
from Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Korea and Japan in line 
with our customers’ increasing demand for Asian programmes. 
Reinforcing Astro’s “home of sports” status in customers’ minds, 
we saw the first ever HD and 3D broadcast of Olympics 2012 
over 12 channels and HD broadcast of Euro 2012 over 5 
interactive channels. We also continue to add to our stable of 
Astro Supersport programmes and channels to broadcast popular 
local and international sports content.
Since its launch, Astro Tutor TV continues to grow from strength to 
strength as students refer to the content to prepare for Malaysia’s 
three major national exams. Oh My English!, a learning programme 
on Astro TVIQ channel which aims to help Malaysians improve their 
conversational English in a fun manner, has seen a huge following 
and generated additional revenue streams beyond the traditional 
pay-TV. Today in its second season, Oh My English! continues to be 
the #1 educational brand in Malaysia, with a strong likelihood of our 
IP being exported to other markets. 
Increasingly, our content is made available across multiple 
platforms. For example, our popular drama series, Adam & Hawa, 
became a local phenomenon and attracted over 1.2 million viewers, 
while its hit song, Muara Hati, stayed on the radio charts for many 
weeks. Our Chinese New Year campaign, 
u
lala, is a good example 
of a 360° approach where the u
lala idea has evolved into a TV 
programme, a movie, a song and merchandise.

Customer Value Proposition 
We are focused on the demands of the consumer, and 
we aspire to serve our customers’ choice of lifestyle 
and content consumption. 
We have now extended our reach into the greater 
majority of Malaysian households through NJOI, our 
non-subscription based free DTH satellite TV service 
offering 19 TV and 20 radio channels. We are pleased 
to say that NJOI has gained significant traction, with 
approximately 209,000 customers signing up since its 
launch in February 2012. NJOI is set to make us a 
stronger medium for advertisers, as well as provide a 
bigger marketing base for discretionary spend and 
upselling. In July 2012, we started offering prepaid 
content packages whereby NJOI customers can access 
our signature content on a discretionary basis.
As at 31 January 2013, our Basic Family Package, 
priced at RM37.95, comprised 41 TV channels and 20 
radio channels. We then provide our subscribers with 
the flexibility to choose from over 20 packages to best 
suit their viewing needs and budget. We also offer 
premium packages and pay-per-view services. In 2012, 
we added 209,000 (2011: 136,000) customers to our 
pay platform. We are encouraged by our customers’ 
response to our new value added products and services 
such as HD (1.3 million), Astro PVR (299,000), 
Superpacks (727,000), Astro First and Astro Best (6 
million buys). Our customer HD take-up is arguably 
among global best in class in terms of speed of 
adoption and penetration levels.
Our Astro B.yond IPTV service powered by Maxis was 
launched in April 2013, and together with our Astro 
B.yond IPTV powered by TIME proposition, gives us 
access to 1.4 million homes i.e. the widest fibre-to-the-
home broadband coverage in Malaysia. This 
collaboration is in response to our customers increasing 
need for a comprehensive value proposition 
incorporating choices in content, bandwidth, experience 
and value.
As we observe our customers’ increasing preference for 
flexibility to view content on multiple devices, coupled 
with an increasingly mobile lifestyle, we launched our 
OTT service, AOTG in May 2012 in conjunction with 
the Euro 2012. The reception has been tremendous 
with over 4.1 million views and over 400,000 application 
downloads within a short span of time, proving that 
our On-The Go service resonates with our audience. 
Subsequently in March 2013, we launched AOTG 
International, whereby, access to our content will, in 
phases, be made available globally; commencing with 
Astro Awani, our news and information service, and 
Astro Arena, our local sports offering, so that all 
Malaysians abroad may access local news and sports 
content. AOTG is now also commercially available to 
non-Astro customers.

Astro is committed to achieving long-
term sustainable success and continuously 
creating value for our shareholders, through 
strategic initiatives as outlined in the CEO’s 
Statement. 
Since we listed in October 2012, the 
Board of Directors has declared 2 interim 
quarterly dividends of 1.5 sen per share 
after the third and fourth quarter results 
respectively. The Board of Directors has 
also recommended a final dividend of 1 
sen per share, subject to shareholders’ 
approval at our AGM to be held on 3 July 
2013. The total of 4 sen represents an 
annualised dividend yield of 2.9%(1) based 
on the closing price of RM2.79 as at 31 
January 2013. The payment of dividends 
for the financial year ended January 2013 
is earlier than that articulated in our 
dividend policy statement disclosed in our 
IPO prospectus. 
We undertake a policy of active capital 
management, and leveraging on invested 
capital, we believe Astro will continue to 
be highly cash generative enabling us to 
adopt a progressive dividend policy.
investor engagement
We value our relationship with our investors 
and communication with them is of 
primary importance to us. We proactively 
and regularly engage with the investment 
community to share our strategy and to 
discuss our strategy, operations, business 
and financial performance, and ensure 
a timely and fair dissemination of 
information. 
The Investor Relations team facilitates 
direct interaction and engagement 
between the senior management team 
and research analysts and institutional 
investors through face-to-face meetings 
and teleconferences held at our offices. In 
addition, we maintain ongoing dialogue 
throughout the financial year with the 
investment community through a number 
of other initiatives.

Quarterly financial results briefing 
and announcement
Each quarter, our financial results are 
released publicly through announcements to 
the Bursa Securities. These announcements 
contain financial statements, summary 
financial and operational indicators and 
an analysis of performance.
Immediately following the release to 
the Bursa Securities, a press conference 
is typically held to update members of 
the press and other media and to provide 
clarification on questions which they may 
have. In addition to this, a teleconference is 
held for research analysts and institutional 
investors who are based locally or abroad. 
These sessions are chaired by the CEO 
and attended by the senior management 
team, reflecting our commitment to 
provide clear communication and a high 
degree of transparency to the public and 
the investment community.
Conferences and Roadshows
We reach out to a wider investor audience 
locally and internationally by participating 
in non-deal roadshows in major global 
financial capitals including Kuala Lumpur, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, San Francisco, 
New York, Boston, London, Edinburgh and 
Frankfurt. The CEO and members of the 
senior management team also regularly 
attend investor conferences. These 
events provide an excellent opportunity 
to maintain regular contact with existing 
institutional shareholders, to reach out to 
potential investors and to build rapport 
with the investment community. In total 
since our listing in October 2012, we have 
conducted approximately 140 meetings 
and teleconferences with research analysts 
and institutional investors in the various 
investor relations initiatives.
Investor Communications
The Investor Relations team maintains a 
portal, www.astromalaysia.com.my, which 
serves as a platform of communication and 
a source of information for shareholders 
and the general public. The information 
available on the portal includes financial 
results, presentation materials, disclosures 
to the Bursa Securities and press releases. 
We welcome feedback from the investing 
community in order to further improve 
our interaction with them. The Investor  
Relations team can be contacted via  
ir@astromalaysia.com.my.

2. STRENG THENING COMPOSITION
 T he Code places great importance on the role of the Board 
in providing leadership, enhancing board effectiveness by 
strengthening its composition and reinforcing its 
independence. The Board, as of the date of this statement 
has seven members which comprises an Executive Director 
(who is also the CEO) and six Non-Executive Directors. Three 
of the six Non-Executive Directors including the Board 
Chairman are independent, which is higher than the minimum 
requirement of one-third of the Board to be independent 
directors as prescribed in the Code and the Listing 
Requirements. 
 T
he profile of each Director is set out on pages 38 to 41 of 
this Annual Report. Given its diversity in experience and 
qualifications, the Board considers that the balance achieved 
between Executive and Non-Executive Directors during the 
financial year under review was appropriate and effective for 
the control and direction of the Group’s business. The Board 
is also of the opinion that the Board composition during the 
year under review had fairly represented the ownership 
structure of the Group with appropriate representations of 
minority interest through the Independent Directors. 
3. R EINFORCING  I NDEPENDENCE
 T he Independent Directors play a pivotal role in corporate 
accountability and provide unbiased and independent views 
and judgement to the Board’s deliberation and decision 
making process, which is reflected in their membership of the 
various Board Committees and attendance of meetings as 
detailed above. In addition, the Non-Executive Directors 
ensure that matters and issues brought up to the Board are 
fully discussed and examined, taking into account the interest 
of all stakeholders. 
 T
he Board takes cognisance of the Code’s recommendation 
that the tenure of an independent director should not exceed 
a cumulative term of nine years. The majority of the Directors 
have been in service for over two years since the formation 
of the Company in 2011 pursuant to a group reorganisation. 
Dato’ Mohamed Khadar Bin Merican has served as an 
Independent Director of the group since 2003 prior to the 
formation of the Company. Within the spirit of the 
recommendation, the Board will seek shareholders’ approval 
at the forthcoming AGM to re-elect Dato’ Mohamed Khadar 
as an Independent Director on the basis that he continues 
to exercise independent judgement and to act in the best 
interest of the Group, he has detailed knowledge of the 
business and has proven commitment, experience and 
competency to effectively advise and oversee the 
management. 
4. FOSTERING  C OMMITMENT
Time commitment
 T he Directors are fully aware of their responsibilities and will 
dedicate sufficient time to carry out such responsibilities. The 
Directors attend the quarterly Board meetings which normally 
span 1-2 days, the AGM and hold regular meetings with 
Management throughout the year. The Board meeting dates 
are planned ahead of schedule and a commitment is obtained 
from the Directors on their availability. All the Directors provide 
notification for accepting a new appointment. 
 All Dir
ectors have complied with the restrictions on the number 
of directorships in public listed and non-public listed companies 
as prescribed under the Listing Requirements. This ensures that 
their commitment, resources and time are focused on the 
affairs of the Group to enable them to discharge their duties 
effectively.
Director’s training
 T he Board recognises the need to continuously enhance its 
skills and knowledge and to keep abreast with the developments 
in the economy, industry and technology, among others. 
Director’s orientation programmes which include visits to the 
Group’s business operations and meetings with Management 
are organised for newly appointed Directors. 
 All the Dir
ectors have attended seminars or briefings during 
the financial year. They are kept informed of available 
training programmes on a regular basis and an appropriate 
budget has been allocated for Directors’ training. Among the 
seminars or briefings attended by one or more Directors 
during the financial year include: 
•

management activities and technology initiatives as well as new 
statutory and regulatory requirements. All the Directors have 
attended and completed the Mandatory Accreditation Programme 
prescribed by the Bursa Securities. 
Directors’ Remuneration
 T he Board believes that remuneration should be sufficient to 
attract, retain, motivate and incentivise Directors of the necessary 
calibre, expertise and experience to lead the Group. The Board will 
consider market comparables, time required, success of the Group 
as well as the level of responsibility and risks.
 
 I
n line with this philosophy, remuneration for the Executive 
Director/CEO is aligned to individual and corporate performance 
based on agreed key performance indicators established by 
the Board. The RC recommends the policy framework and is 
responsible for assessing the compensation package for the 
Executive Director/CEO. 
Elements of Remuneration of Executive Director
 Pur suant to an employment contract, the Executive Director/
CEO, Dato’ Rohana Rozhan’s remuneration package is based 
on the following elements:

etionary performance bonus in cash and 
share incentives subject to meeting agreed performance 
targets as recommended by the RC and approved by the 
Board
• Defined c
ontribution plan, participation in gratuity 
scheme, benefits in kind and other allowances
• A r
ecurring car allowance and driver as well as medical 
coverage
 Either 
party may terminate the employment by giving 6 
months’ prior written notice. 
 F
or Non-Executive Directors, the level of remuneration primarily 
reflects the experience, time, level of responsibilities and 
complexity shouldered. The Board, subject to a maximum sum 
as set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, determines 
fees payable to Non-Executive Directors. Individual Directors 
abstain from discussions and do not participate in determining 
their own remuneration. Non-Executive Directors are entitled 
to director’s fees and additional fees for undertaking 
responsibilities as chairman or member of Board Committees. 
They are also paid meeting allowances and expenses incurred 
in the course of their duties are reimbursed. They are not 
entitled to any bonus or share incentives.

As a Board, we have the overall responsibility to 
establish a sound risk management framework 
and internal control system by adopting best 
practices, instilling good risk management and 
implementing strong internal control systems for 
the Group in order to ensure key risk areas are 
managed to an acceptable level to achieve our 
Group’s business objectives. The Board 
continually reviews its adequacy, effectiveness 
and integrity in order to safeguard the 
Company’s assets and shareholders’ interest. 
Due to the limitations inherent in any such 
systems, this is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate risks and to provide reasonable but 
not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The Board has implemented a formal risk 
management and internal control framework 
which defines the continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating, monitoring and 
managing risks and controls to an acceptable 
risk appetite in its daily operations and as and 
when there are changes to the business 
environment or regulatory requirements.  
This process is regularly reviewed by the 
Management and Board based on the guidance 
prescribed in the “Statement of Risk Management 
and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of 
Listed Issuers”. 
1. Risk Management
 T he Board is committed to the  
implementation of Group Risk Management 
(“GRM”) as an integral part of the Group’s 
planning practices and business processes, 
encapsulating the continuous identification, 
assessment, monitoring and reporting of 
risks at all levels, from projects, operations 
to strategy. The Group Risk Management 
Framework, consistent with the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organisation (“COSO”) 
Enterprise Risk Management framework, 
sets out the risk management governance 
and infrastructure, risk management 
processes and control responsibilities. 
 T
he Board through the AC is assisted by the 
Group Risk Management Committee, 
chaired by the CEO and comprises senior 
management from one each business 
segments and units. The GRMC meets at 
least once on a quarterly basis to review 
the effectiveness of the GRM process and 
reports arising from risk management 
activities as well as to deliberate on the 
risks identified, controls and risk mitigation 
strategies. The CEO and CFO are 
accountable to the Board for the 
implementation of strategies, policies and 
procedures to achieve an effective risk 
management framework. Risk management 
has been identified as a key result area in 
the annual performance evaluation of the 
CEO and CFO. 
 
The Board has the overall responsibility 
to establish a sound risk management 
framework and internal control system by 
adopting best practices, instilling good 
risk management and implementing 
strong internal control systems ensure key 
risk areas are managed to achieve our 
Group’s business objectives.

corporate governancesTATeMeNT oN RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
 T he Group Process, Risk and Assurance Department (“GPRA”) 
monitors and ensures the group risk management and internal 
control practices are adhered to by all business owners within 
the company. Each of the business units is represented by a risk 
champion who reports to the respective heads of business units 
and segments. The GPRA works with the respective risk 
champions and reports to the head of business segments on a 
quarterly basis on the review and update their respective 
business risk profiles, identify emerging risks resulting from 
changing business environment and/or new initiatives being 
implemented, evaluate effectiveness of controls and determine 
if action plans implemented are working effectively. Subsequently, 
the GPRA consolidate business unit risks into the Group Risk 
Register which provides an overview of the Group Risk Profile 
which are thereafter tabled and reviewed by the GRMC and AC 
on a quarterly basis. Additionally, there is a rolling programme 
where senior management from the business present their risk 
management plans to the AC. The Group’s principal risks and its 
corresponding mitigation measures are detailed on pages 59 to 
60 of this Annual Report. In ensuring that the process is robust, 
the risks and controls identified are independently validated by 
the Corporate Assurance function.
 Risk aw
areness and control consciousness is integral in 
cultivating good risk and governance culture among the Group 
employees. Risk and control briefings, online trainings and web 
portal are in place to facilitate the ease of reference and 
better understanding of the risk management framework and 
internal control procedures. 
2. C ontrol Environment and Structure

risks prior to an automated workflow system sign-off. 
Subsequently, the submissions of the key control checklists 
are subject to independent validation by the Group PRA

GROUP RISK
MANAGEMENT
As a leading media and entertainment provider, the Group faces many challenges in achieving its 
strategic objectives. The Group’s Risk Management initiatives guided by the Group Risk Management 
Framework aim to timely identify, proactively evaluate the impact and consequences of these risks, 
and ensure the Group’s preparedness and its ability to mitigate them in response to the evolving 
economic and regulatory landscapes as well as innovations and technological advancements. The 
continuous risk management and monitoring process is reported by the respective business units to 
the Group Risk Management Committee and thereafter to the Audit Committee and the Board as 
depicted in the diagram below. 
Risks, whether individual or in combination, may significantly affect the Group’s financial performance 
and should be carefully weighed with any forward-looking statement in the Annual Report. The key 
risks highlighted and summarised below are not exhaustive.
RISK FACTORS 

---- Page 62 ----

corporate governance
Market and Competition
We acknowledge the presence of competition in the TV and 
content media market in Malaysia including players offering 
bundled mobile, TV and data services. Additionally, there may be 
competitive pressures on our TV and Radio Adex share. The Group 
is cognisant of the competitive landscape and has established the 
appropriate strategies and measures to compete in this environment.
Political, Legal and Regulatory
The Group operates in an industry that is subject to a broad range 
of rules and regulations put in place by various governing bodies 
and relevant authorities. New rules and regulations may also be 
implemented from time to time and we recognise that any non-
compliances thereof may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group’s financial performance and operations. To manage any 
potential uncertainties, the Board and Management constantly 
keep abreast with all relevant developments and are in regular 
contact with the relevant authorities and the Group’s legal advisors, 
and emphasise strict compliance with all relevant rules and 
regulations. 
Services Availability
The Group is highly dependent on a wide range of systems, 
including the M
EASAT
-3 and MEASAT-3a satellites, broadcast 
equipment and business systems, in order to deliver high-quality 
services to our customers. The Group continually reviews and 
enhances its systems and their interconnectivity to minimise service 
interruption. The Group also has two broadcast centres and 
alternative hot-site for its business systems which provides 
redundant capacity for transmission and business resumption 
purposes. Business continuity plans are regularly reviewed and 
tested by the Group coupled with a fit-for-purpose insurance 
program to further mitigate business losses. 
Procuring Exclusive and Compelling Content
Popular content with TV audiences is pivotal for customer acquisition 
and retention. The increasing cost of sourcing or procuring external 
content, especially relating to sports and premium content, as well 
as third-party channels licensed for a limited period may result in 
our inability to obtain or renew compelling TV content at acceptable 
rates. In our radio operations, the ability to produce appealing 
radio content is key to the Group’s position as the leading radio 
network in Malaysia. Thus, the Group constantly explores 
opportunities to develop proprietary-signature content and works 
closely with key programme providers while diversifying its sources 
of third-party content. 
Technology and Innovation 
Technology and innovation are critical to our business and industry. 
The Group strives to be at the forefront in technology and 
innovation to achieve the first mover advantage in making content 
available on all platforms from DTH to IPTV to AOTG. At the same 
time, our facilities and equipment are continuously being upgraded 
to enhance security, improving delivery of high definition and rolling 
out quality customer experiences. The Group has also taken steps 
to maintain best in class operations with 99.9935% availability 
while ensuring its systems remain current and relevant through 
continuous maintenance and system upgrades.
Financial
The effective management of its financial exposures namely 
foreign currency, interest rates and credit risks are key to preserving 
the Group’s profitability and sustainability. The Group’s Finance 
team provides support to management and to ensure accurate 
financial reporting and tracking of the Group’s business performance 
with monthly reporting on financial performance provided to the 
Board. The Group guided by the Treasury policy under the purview 
of the Treasury Committee, also manages risk to capital and cash 
investments by providing appropriate protection against foreign 
currency and interest rate movements. 
People
The Group’s success depends to a significant extent upon, among 
other factors, our ability to continue to attract, retain and develop 
our human capital and talent across our operations. Thus, our 
inability to attract, retain and develop our human capital and 
talent could have a material and adverse effect on our business, 
prospects, results of operations and financial position. The Group’s 
people strategies places importance on making Astro a great work 
place as well as various talent development programmes such as 
Graduate programme, an apprenticeship programmes well as high 
potential and talent pool leadership development programmes as 
part of the Group’s key functions succession planning initiative.
Branding and Reputation
Brand identity and brand value are crucial to operating companies 
within the Group as it drives overall reputation of the organisation. 
The Group advocates corporate responsibility through programmes 
that focus on community development, education, nurturing of our 
youth and conservation of the environment. The Group has launched 
the Go Beyond branding campaign that integrates all subsidiaries 
within the Group as well as to reinforce our brand equity in the 
public’s eyes.

Our consumers are increasingly affluent
One of the economically stronger developing economies in the region, Malaysia’s economy 
is undergoing a significant transition. With one of the highest GDP based on PPP 
(Purchasing Power Parity) per capita levels among developing countries in Asia, Malaysia’s 
economy is steadily catching up to that of advanced countries in the region. Malaysia’s per 
capita affluence is now comparable to South Korea’s a decade ago and is experiencing a 
similar transformation.
GDP PPP per capita of regional economies in 2011 (International dollar)
 
Astro’s growth is underpinned by the strong macroeconomic 
and demographic dynamics of Malaysia, and by wider trends 
in the consumer media space. We view ourselves primarily as 
a content and consumer company, and we continuously track 
the evolving media consumption needs of our consumers to 
increase our relevance, and our share of their wallets.

Malaysia is also showing strong growth in terms of its population, 
with decreases in infant mortality rates and improvements in public 
health. Malaysia’s population is forecast to achieve a CAGR of 1.7% 
over the next 5 years, a higher growth rate compared to other 
developing Asian countries like China (0.5%), Indonesia (1.0%), 
Thailand (0.5%) and Vietnam (1.1%). This growth rate is only 
marginally surpassed by the Philippines (1.9%).
In addition, Malaysian household growth is forecast to surpass 
population growth, underpinned by a decline in the size of the 
household. With factors like expected income growth, an increased 
requirement to move away from family homes to live and work, 
and a decline in extended family households, the size of a Malaysian 
household is forecast to decline from 4.3 persons per household in 
2011 to 4.1 persons in 2016. This factor, combined with population 
growth, sees the number of Malaysian households forecast to grow 
from 6.7 million in 2011 to 7.7 million in 2017.

Our consumers are increasingly receptive to new 
products and services
Reflecting the high level of development in the country, 
Malaysia’s urbanisation ratio is approximately 72% of its 
population; which is higher than that of other Asian 
developing countries such as China (47%), Indonesia 
(44%), the Philippines (49%), Thailand (34%) and Vietnam 
(30%). Malaysia’s urbanisation ratio is forecast to reach 
75% of its total population by 2016, equivalent to an 
estimated urban population of 23.5 million and a rural 
population of 7.8 million.
Malaysia’s population is also one of the youngest in the 
region. In 2010, 57% of the population was under the 
age of 30 years, with a median age of 27 years. This is 
a relatively young population when compared to countries 
such as China (36), Indonesia (28), Thailand (34), and 
Vietnam (28), and much younger when compared to that 
of developed countries like Singapore (40), Hong Kong 
(43), Australia (38) and New Zealand (37).
The above factors help to drive a faster adoption of the 
latest trends in communications, modern consumer 
electronics and media consumption; faster than what 
Malaysia’s economic development status would otherwise 
infer.
In 2012, smartphone sales in Malaysia topped 6 million, 
with a penetration rate of approximately 42%. Market 
analysts forecast continuing CAGR of 19% between 2012 
and 2016, given the declining prices of handsets, an 
increasing proliferation of high-speed data services, a 
growing ecosystem encouraging application usage (in 
particular, for social networking and video content) and 
increasing urbanisation. It is forecast that tablet adoption 
will experience strong growth over the same period, 
reaching over 2 million devices (penetration rate above 
30%). The mobile subscription penetration rate in 
Malaysia is now at approximately 140% (42 million 
subscribers) with mobile phone usage exactly TV and 
laptop/desktop consumption as the following statistics 
highlight:
•
 u
sing mobile devices: 103 mins daily 
•
 W
atching TV: 99 mins daily 
• Going online on their deskt
ops/laptops: 89 mins 
daily
In addition, the majority of Malaysian smartphone users 
have cross-media usage habits; like listening to music 
(63%) and accessing the internet via their devices (57%).
Our consumers are increasingly looking for local 
content
As Asian economies gain ascendancy on the global 
stage, there is an increasing interest for Asian culture, 
including an affinity towards Asian pop culture and 
entertainment. We see very similar trends in Malaysia 
with our ethnically diverse population. For Astro 
subscribers, our 71 Astro created and branded channels, 
in particular the vernacular channels, have become their 
major source of TV entertainment. According to a 
Nielsen survey, on average there are 10 million viewers 
watching Astro in Malaysia. Of the top 10 viewed 
channels in Astro households of each race, Astro 
broadcasts at least six of them. Our vernacular channels 
like Astro Ria, Prima and Ceria, Astro Hua Hee Dai and 
AEC, have attained higher viewership ratings than other 
turnaround channels; and self-produced programmes 
like “MasterChef Malaysia”, “Raja Lawak”, “ Astro CGM 
Singing Competition”, and football matches on Astro 
Arena have consistently achieved higher ratings than 
free-to-air programmes.
For Astro subscribers, our 71 
Astro branded channels have 
become their major source of 
TV entertainment.

Crucial to the healthy growth in our pay-TV revenue lies our 
success in creating and developing our own-produced content 
(content IPs) and iconic brands across a variety of key genres for 
all our platforms. These offerings include signature programmes 
such as Oh My English!, Maharaja Lawak, Adam & Hawa, 
Malaysian FA football, Celebrity Masterchef, Celebrity Fear Factor 
and more. During the year, we produced approximately 9,000 
hours of content, an increase of about 1,000 hours from the 
previous year, and to date, we have a very significant content 
library with over 49,000 hours of content spanning across multiple 
genres, including Malay comedies, education, Islamic and Hokkien 
content. We showcase these content properties on our 71 Astro 
created and branded channels, which account for the bulk of 
Astro TV viewing, and include Astro Awani and Astro Arena, 
Malaysia’s only 24/7 news and sports channels.
 
Our 164 channels, including 28 HD channels, provide the best of 
local, regional, international and sports content; making Astro a 
comprehensive pay-TV proposition. We continue to build our 
regional relationships, sourcing content from Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
India, Indonesia, Korea and Japan. We also maintain long-term 
relationships with an extensive range of premium channels such 
as The National Geographic Channel, Disney Channel, Discovery 
Channel, AXN, ESPN and FOX Movies Premium. Our sports 
offerings highlight the best of popular sports content; for example 
the Barclays Premier League, BWF Badminton, NBA, Roland 
Garros (French Open) and the FIFA World Cup.
 
VOD helps us provide our customers greater choice and 
accessibility. Astro First makes available local and regional films 
2  weeks after cinema release, whilst Astro Best brings the best of 
Hollywood and Asian movies 3 months after cinema release. We 
also now offer an extensive VOD library of over 1,500 titles.
 
Pushing forward with innovation, our content properties have 
been designed to fit changing content consumption behaviours, 
and to engage our viewers and enhance their viewing experience 
with offerings in a full 360° manner. These include live events, 
dedicated websites, games, merchandise, publications, songs and 
mobile applications; all of which have helped further differentiate 
Astro’s content. Our segmented content approach provides not 
only mass appeal content but also premium content, as well as 
vernacular content that cater to the different ethnic groups in 
Malaysia.
Signature content in Malay, Hokkien & T amil drove viewership
The production of local content, particularly for the Malay-
speaking population, continues to be a key focus. Building on the 
success of the Raja Lawak and Maharaja Lawak franchises, we 
recruited a stable of comedy talent and continued to create 
popular comedy IPs during the year such as Karoot Komedia and 
Super Spontan, to win the hearts of the Malay audience. The 
premier episode of Maharaja Lawak Mega (MLM) hit new records 
in viewership, garnering an astounding 1.9 million viewers. As at 
31 January 2013, MLM 2012 had achieved 3.9 million viewers 
cumulatively on TV, 1.5 million views on YouTube and over 
111,000 unique visitors on its website.
In a space typically dominated by free-to-air television (FTA), 
Adam & Hawa, a TV drama which is adapted from the novel of 
the same title, successfully enhanced our drama offering and 
became a local phenomenon. It successfully drove an increase in 
our HD take up by 120,000 during the telecast of this series and 
recorded over 1.2 million viewers on TV. The series and the music 
video of its theme song “Muara Hati”, hit over 1.4 million views 
and 4 million views on YouTube respectively. The song, performed 
by Dato’ Siti Nurhaliza and Astro’s own talent, Hafiz, also 
dominated the radio charts on Era FM for many weeks.

In line with the multi-lingual preference of our subscribers, we also 
produce and aggregate content in dialects such as Cantonese and 
Hokkien for our Chinese subscribers and Hindi, Telegu and 
Malayalam for our Indian subscribers. Building on the success of 
our “Hua Hee” franchise, we introduced Hua Hee Family, a new 
content format emphasising family bonds and values. Hua Hee 
Family reached over 120,000 viewers.
Some of our more popular Indian content includes Vaanavil Super 
Star – a singing competition, Aattam 100 Vagai – a dance 
competition and documentaries such as Thigil and Viyarvai. We 
have the highest viewership of the Indian community as we 
provide all the available genres – comedy, drama, movies and 
documentaries.
Throughout the year, Astro introduced a wide variety of innovative 
content formats and initiatives that constituted several firsts for 
our customers. These included:-
•
 In the r
ecent Chinese New Year season to welcome the year 
of the snake, a winning theme “Ulala” (“ular” being the Malay 
word for snake) was created and executed in a full 360° 
manner, a first-of-its-kind campaign involving content, music, 
interactive games and ground events whilst at the same time, 
uniquely integrating movie-making with the nation’s 
participation.
• D
uring the recent Thaipusam celebrations, we broadcasted 
the festivities from four locations, namely Batu Caves, Ipoh, 
and Penang. The telecast generated vast interest in Malaysia 
and around the globe from India, the 
uS and C
anada to 
France and Mauritius, with over 2.2 million views achieved on 
YouTube.
We continued to champion learning content for Malaysian children 
in multiple languages. During the year, we achieved tremendous 
success in creating content brands and IPs for English and 
Mandarin learning content:- 
•
 Oh My English!, a 360° br
eakthrough in language learning has 
become a pop culture phenomenon with 3.6 million viewers 
on TV, 8.5 million YouTube views for short format videos, has 
over 427,000 Facebook fans, became the No. 1 trending topic 
on Twitter and No.1 show on AOTG and also had 70,000 
copies of magazines sold/sponsored. This IP has generated 
diverse revenue streams beyond TV and is now the No.1 
educational brand in Malaysia with increasing likelihood of 
our IP being exported to other markets. 
•
 Happ
y Dragon 1,000 Why, a first of its kind Chinese educational 
comic published every month using the iconic Happy Dragon 
character, has successfully sold over 200,000 copies to date.
In addition to producing our own local content, the past 12 months 
also saw increasing efforts to localise popular international content 
to improve the content relevance for our customers. In conjunction 
with National Day and Malaysia Day, we introduced My Hometown, 
featuring unique stories on what makes Malaysia’s hometowns 
distinctive and unforgettable. This campaign successfully positioned 
Astro as the leader in championing Malaysian stories and promoting 
national pride.
In the past year, we launched closed caption subtitles on all 
international HD channels to enhance our customers’ viewing 
experience. Astro B.yond HD customers are now able to select their 
preferred audio track for international HD channels. For the first 
time, we have also initiated the dubbing of international content 
into Bahasa Malaysia using the voices of Astro’s talent e.g. Smurfs 
on HBO and Ben 10 on Cartoon Network. Overall, we dubbed and 
subtitled over 15,000 hours of programming in 2012, a significant 
increase over prior years.

During the year, we 
achieved greater 
success in monetising 
our content via 
distribution within 
and beyond 
Malaysia, by 
leveraging on our 
buying strength and 
our own IPs.
The most sought after sports content
2012 saw the first ever HD and 3D broadcast of Olympics 2012 
over 12 channels, and HD broadcast of Euro 2012 over 5 
interactive channels. These properties were also monetised 
amongst non-sports subscribers for the first time via a season 
pass, garnering 22,000 and 15,000 sign-ups for the Olympics and 
Euro respectively. We continue to add to our stable of our own 
series of Astro SuperSport channels showing popular international 
sports content such as 
u
EFA European Football Championship, 
German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, BWF Badminton, NBA, Roland 
Garros (French Open), the FIFA World Cup and the Barclays 
Premier League. Through Astro Arena, Malaysia’s first and only 
24/7 local sports channel, we address our subscribers’ keen 
interest in local sports content, while helping inculcate keen 
interests in sports among the younger generation. 
New revenues through content distribution 
We continued to reinforce our competitive edge in content 
aggregation by ensuring we secured key content and renewed key 
contracts on improved terms. During the year, we successfully 
secured the Barclays Premier League within budget for the new 
seasons from 2013/14 to 2015/16. In addition to sports content, 
we successfully secured additional VOD content for delivery on 
STBs, online and mobile which covers vast genres which includes 
movies, cartoons, Japanese animes, as well as Hong Kong movies 
produced during the golden era of Hong Kong movies in 1980s till 
2000s. 
In the past 12 months, we have achieved greater success in 
monetising our content via distribution within and beyond 
Malaysia, by leveraging on our buying strength and our own IPs. 
We sub-licensed selected sports properties, namely Euro 2012, 
Champions League Season 2011/12 and BWF Badminton to other 
platforms in Malaysia such as Media Prima, Telekom Malaysia 
and RTM. We successfully distributed Malay and Indian channels, 
as well as selected local production as VOD content to Singapore, 
and also distributed approximately 260 hours of local Chinese 
content including travelogue, movies and kids content regionally 
to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. In addition, we provided 
inflight entertainment content for 4 international airlines, namely 
MAS, AirAsia, AirAsia X and Garuda.

Our TV talent pool
Our talent unit continues to actively nurture talent and play its part 
in developing the Malaysian entertainment industry. Its portfolio of 
talent includes actors, singers, comedians, announcers, performers; 
most of whom hail from popular talent quests produced by our 
own content division such as Akademi Fantasia and Raja Lawak. In 
addition to these artistes, we have also signed exclusive contracts 
with top local performers which include actors and actresses such 
as Datuk Aznil Nawawi, Johan, Elfira Loy, and most recently, Keith 
Foo and Hanis Zalikha.
Awards were aplenty during the past 12 months when Hafiz won 
the Best Vocal and Best Song awards during the Anugerah Juara 
Lagu 26, as well as Best Vocals in Anugerah Juara Lagu 27. In 
2012, Hafiz, Aaron Aziz, Johan and Zizan Razak were respectively 
voted as the Most Popular Male Singer, Most Popular Male Film 
Actor, Most Popular Male Comedy Artiste and Most Popular Male 
TV Host.

Raising the bar in customer experience
With our increasing customer base of 3.5 million, we expanded our channel distribution 
breadth by leveraging on multiple distribution platforms and touch points to reach both 
new, as well as existing subscribers. Our initiatives during the year have resulted in:-
•
 Ext
ended market coverage and providing customers with easier access to Astro’s services 
when we established sales partnerships with an additional 1,500 distributors and 
dealers, appointed retailers and are currently embarking on setting up a new sales 
channel with third-party agencies nationwide;
•
 Incr
eased sales presence by adding on more high traffic outlets in selected hypermarkets 
nationwide from 150 to 300;
• 50% sur
ge in retailer sales contribution year-on-year when we introduced our Retailer 
Privilege Service to our top tier retailers;
•
 Launch 
of Astro Lifestyle Centre (ALC), a new concept store where customers have the 
opportunity to experience, the full suite of Astro’s products and services firsthand, whilst 
further strengthening our brand presence in major cities. To date, two ALCs have been 
launched, the first at Batu Pahat Mall and the second at Ikano Power Centre, Mutiara 
Damansara.

In addition to expanding our reach, we are progressively improving 
our service delivery with enhanced system capabilities to promote 
a higher level of customer advocacy:-
•
 Our CRM syst
em was upgraded in September 2012 to focus 
on delivering additional capabilities to improve the end-to-end 
fulfillment process and customers’ experience. In addition, we 
launched a Personal Identification Number (PIN) management 
system, which enables customers to register for secured self-
service capabilities. Customers can pre-register their credit 
cards through the PIN system and perform transactions across 
multiple channels such as online, SMS and Interactive Voice 
Response;
•
 W
e launched the Astro Service Portal on Channel 200 in June 
2012, an onscreen service platform which enables package 
upgrades, balance enquiries and product updates with the 
simple use of a remote control. This resulted in more package 
upgrades, savings in cost-to-serve, as well as savings of almost 
RM2 million in sales commission due to submissions of 
greenfield and box swaps through this channel during the 
year;
We continue to introduce 
compelling products and 
services that are relevant 
to the lifestyle needs of 
our customers.
• T hrough our Customer Self-Care Portal, we continue to 
encourage our customers to interact online with us which 
reduced our lead time in attending to customers’ requests and 
queries. We also introduced online services which includes 
e-billing to provide our customers with a more convenient 
billing experience;
•
 W
e have also extended our payment service coverage via third 
party electronic payment solution providers and increased 
payment channel access points from 16,000 to 22,000, 
focusing on under-serviced areas, as well as suburban and 
rural locations.
As we continue to transform our business, it is fundamental that 
our customers remain at the core of that change, and in August 
2012, we relaunched our Customer Loyalty and Rewards Program 
– Astro Circle, to focus on enhancing loyalty and building lifetime 
partnerships with our customers. We are also committed to building 
aspirations in young children and have enlisted more than 1,200 
children nationwide to our Astro Circle Education Program which 
mainly focuses on improving skills in languages, arts and crafts as 
well as sports. For the year ahead, we seek to increase the reach of 
our loyalty programs through more holistic reward schemes to 
reward our loyal customers and solidify our long-term relationship 
with them.

our Commitment to innovation
Innovation has always been the driving force behind every facet 
of our business, from developing content to leveraging on cutting-
edge technology for operational excellence and rolling out quality 
customer experiences. We continue to introduce compelling 
products and services that are relevant to the lifestyle and 
content consumption needs of our customers.
HD – No. 1 in HD services
During the year, we expanded our bouquet of HD channels by 
launching an additional 10 channels, closing the year at 28 HD 
channels, which include movies, drama, sports, general 
entertainment and documentaries. The two most recent channels 
launched are KBS World HD and Astro Quan Jia HD. We now have 
vernacular HD content which has significantly boosted take-ups of 
certain packages such as our Mustika pack. As at January 2013, 
we had approximately 1.3 million customers upgraded to our HD 
services, an increase of close to 500,000 customers. We will 
continue to expand the breadth of our HD content offerings, 
which will be further enabled as we take on more transponder 
capacity in the coming years. 
PVR – Allowing subscribers to take control of their TV 
viewing experience
We improved customers’ viewing experience by introducing the 
PVR service which complements linear and non-linear TV viewing. 
During the year, our PVR service was relaunched with an improved 
bundled offer, giving subscribers greater value and enabled more 
subscribers to access the PVR service. This has resulted in a strong 
take-up of the service, leading to a 3.5 times increase in the PVR 
customer base over the financial year to 299,000.
Our Astro B.yond PVR STB now comes with a built-in 500GB hard 
disk which allows subscribers to record content, rewind and pause 
live TV, and play back any recorded programs. We have also 
improved the PVR service experience with enhanced functionalities 
such as Series Link, where viewers can record a whole season’s 
episodes with one button and Remote Record, allowing recording 
from anywhere via smartphones or computers.

Multiroom – catering to different viewing needs of family 
members within the household
Our Multiroom service puts the control in our customers’ hands by 
letting their entire family watch their favourite shows in different 
rooms at a discounted rate to their monthly subscription. In May 
2012, subcribers can add an additional STB for RM50 a month, 
allowing flexibility in accommodating different viewing needs 
within the same household. Subscription to this service doubled 
during the financial year to 218,000.
Superpack – value bundling proposition
We provide our subscribers with the flexibility to choose from over 
20 packages to best suit their viewing needs and budget. Across 
our multiple products and services, we offer a breadth of content 
packages spanning multiple genres, which we believe appeals to 
both mass market and premium subscribers, as well as the urban 
and young segments. 
In 2011, we launched the Superpack, a content bundle proposition 
with value-added services such as HD and PVR. Since then, our 
Superpacks have received a tremendous response and actual take-
up doubled in the past 12 months to over 727,000 subscribers. 
We strengthened our Superpack offerings with the addition of a 
new variant, Superpack 4, targeted at urban premium segments 
who may not be as interested in vernacular content. The Superpack 
remains our flagship product, offering the best of Astro’s 
international, regional and local content, at great value and 
convenience. 
Distributing content beyond DTH satellite
We are making progress in distributing our content over multiple 
delivery platforms. Beyond DTH satellite, Astro content can now 
be delivered via IPTV, AOTG and VOD platforms.
Astro On-The-Go (AOTG) – Delivering entertainment anytime 
anywhere
Leveraging on the consumer’s desire for flexibility to view content 
on multiple devices and to expand our content reach beyond 
household to individuals, in May 2012, we launched AOTG, an 
OTT service for smartphones, tablets and PCs. With AOTG, we 
extended the portability of our content by giving customers 
seamless access anytime and anywhere. We believe that customers 
are looking for more features and functionality in their TV viewing, 


---- Page 82 ----

business overview
particularly in terms of what they want, when and where they 
want it, and on whatever device they may be using. The channel 
line-up spans across live events, kids, news and entertainment TV 
channels, radio channels, “catch up” service and VOD content.
We have also now bundled the AOTG service with our multiroom 
subscription, which extends the value proposition from multiroom 
to multi-screen. The take up of our AOTG app has been 
phenomenal with over 400,000 downloads since launch. 
Subsequently, we also launched a free trial phase of AOTG 
International, whereby access to our content will be made 
available globally in phases. AOTG is now also commercially 
available to non-Astro customers.
IPTV – Connected digital home entertainment
Recognising our customers’ quest for increasing bandwidth and 
speed, we are committed to take our customers’ viewing experience 
to a whole new level by providing the widest choices in content 
and high speed broadband, as well as the best value propositions. 
Astro B.yond IPTV is our premium triple-play product that bundles 
the best of Astro’s TV products, high-speed fibre broadband and 
fixed-line telephone services at a great value for our customers. It 
provides for an advanced digital lifestyle via a seamless experience 
to meet the voice, data and entertainment needs of all generations 
within a home. The Astro B.yond IPTV service was launched in 
April 2011 through a partnership with TIME, and as at the end of 
January 2013, we have 11,000 customers on our IPTV service, an 
increase of 8,000 subscribers over the prior year. With the launch 
of Astro B.yond IPTV powered by Maxis on 30 April 2013, we now 
offer the widest footprint for fibre internet services in Malaysia, at 
over 1.4 million homes passed. Our partnership will Maxis will 
enable both Astro and Maxis to cross-sell and up-sell services to 
each other’s’ customers, further driving our ARP
u.
W
e are also collaborating with property developers to “future-
proof” the multimedia and internet experience in Malaysian 
homes and add greater value for property owners with “ Astro B.
yond IPTV ready” home solution. Astro’s first IPTV B2B developer 
deal went live in September 2012 with the handover of The Light 
in Penang – the first stage of a premium waterside development 
with 416 units which were all pre-fibred during construction by 
TIME dotCom and ready for a plug-and-play IPTV installation.
VOD – Extension of our On-Demand services
During the year, we launched Astro B.yond VOD, which offers 
subscribers with Astro B.yond PVR decoders an extensive library of 
over 1,500 local and international titles. Customers can access 
Astro B.yond VOD via our IPTV service, or by connecting their STB 
to any 3rd party broadband service. The service gives our 
subscribers the ability to purchase and watch their favourite 
movie titles via Pay Per View and the ability to watch previously 
missed programmes via Catch 
u
p TV – all through their existing 
remote control. 
In addition, we strive to bring the best of theatrical movies 
exclusively to our viewers in as short a window as possible via 
Astro First, our on-demand local movie proposition, which offers 
movies as early as two weeks after their theatrical releases. 
Following the success of Astro First, we launched Astro Best in 
August 2012, which offers our subscribers access to Hollywood 
and Asian movies at an earlier window compared to the usual 
pay-TV channels. Since launch, we have seen over 6 million buys 
of Astro First and Astro Best movie titles.

NJOI – Malaysia’s first free DTH satellite TV service
NJOI was launched commercially in February 2012. This service 
enables us to extend our coverage into the greater majority of 
Malaysian households by providing a multi-channel TV and radio 
offering the customers who choose not to commit to a recurring 
fee. It is a cost-efficient way of leveraging our existing 
infrastructure to reach the lower income segment while establishing 
an upgrade path towards full subscription based services. As at 
31 January 2013, we have 19 TV channels and 20 radio channels 
on the NJOI platform. In 2012, we are pleased to report that 
NJOI has gained significant traction and achieved customer net 
additions of 209,000. In July 2012, we launched 3 new NJOI 
prepaid packages namely Mustika Pack, Indo Pack and Chinese 
Pack, creating new opportunities to sell on a prepaid basis to 
customers as they seek to access selected content offering. In 
addition to the 3 prepaid packages, we also introduced a prepaid 
sports pack in January 2013. As at the end of January 2013, over 
24,000 packages were activated since the launch of the service, 
of which 70% of these activations were on the Mustika package. 
We will continually innovate to introduce discretionary packages 
at choice price points for our NJOI customers. 
Advertising
Our TV adex revenue grew strongly in the past 12 months, 
charting an 11% year-on-year growth over the previous year, 
outperforming the 6% growth level of the FTA channels. Robust 
growth was recorded across the Malay, Indian and Sports 
segments and branded content posted a 25% growth in revenue. 
We aim to solidify and extend our share of Malaysian adex by 
attracting advertising dollars aimed at both the premium and 
mass segments of the market. Our different premium packages 
offer our clients and advertisers a strong medium to target 
relevant and premium audiences, whilst our NJOI service give 
advertisers a chance to choose from a wide variety of 19 channels 
spread across different language segments to target the mass 
market, thereby providing a traditional mass market advertising 
option. Further, our new lifestyle-based products such as AOTG 
and Stadium Astro will allow advertisers to target customers 
across different complementary platforms whilst offering 
advertisers integrated advertising solutions across TV, radio, 
publishing and online segments. We believe these strategies will 
drive an increase in our share of Adex and consequently our 
advertising revenue.

Malaysia’s No 1 radio operator
Astro Radio reaffirmed its position as Malaysia’s No.1 radio 
operator, with a weekly listener base of 12.3 million (approximately 
51.4% of audience share). Our share of total advertising expenditure 
or radex is approximately 53%, representing the highest market 
share in this space. 
Our all-round excellence is reflected in the numerous recognitions 
and awards won. Astro Radio delivers the No.1 stations in all  
4 languages through ERA FM with 4.5 million weekly listeners, MY 
FM with 2.2 million weekly listeners, hitz.fm with 1.7 million 
weekly listeners and THR Raaga with 1.7 million weekly listeners. 
We also clinched the No. 1 radio station in the east coast of 
Peninsular Malaysia with THR Gegar with a listener base of close 
to 2.0  million. 
We have increased our reach to East Malaysia (in particular,  
in the cities of Kuching and Kota Kinabalu) and in February 2012, 
Nielsen Diary Survey found that Astro Radio had a reach of 
524,700 listeners with a market share of 43% across both cities. 
hitz.fm registered 262,400 listeners, MY FM reached 154,700 
listeners and ERA FM 190,700 listeners.
During the year, we developed several innovative advertising 
campaigns which garnered awards at the prestigious Kancil Awards 
held in November 2012. The award event was established to 
recognise home-grown Malaysian creative excellence in advertising, 
and we are proud to have received a total of 8 awards (1 Silver, 
6 Bronze and 1 Merit) in the creative and copywriting categories of 
the event. We also received the Bronze award in the Media and

Entertainment category for MY FM at the Putra Brand Awards 
2012 as well as the Best Media Organisation (Community Service) 
category at the 2012 NPC Awards in September 2012.
Overall, Astro Radio achieved 7% revenue growth to RM215 million 
in 2012, translating to EBITDA growth of 17% to RM102 million, 
an improvement in margins of approximately 3 percentage points.
New launch – MELODY FM
As a key part to our growth strategy, Astro Radio regularly reviews 
its radio formats to remain our listeners’ choice. In August 2012, we 
reformatted one of our radio stations and launched MELODY FM, a 
Chinese-language station aimed at 35-50 year olds, an increasingly 
affluent segment of the population. Since commencing operations, 
MELODY FM has managed to excite the Chinese advertising market 
with innovative programming and access to a segment which was 
under-served. On-air for just three weeks prior to the second wave 
of the Nielsen radio survey in September 2012, MELODY FM 
registered 134,000 in cumulative listenership and 11.4 hours in 
Time Spent Listening. The MELODY FM format has resulted in the 
station generating RM3.7 million of revenues in less than six 
months of operations as compared to the old format which 
generated revenue of RM1.0 million during the previous year.
Going beyond traditional radio
In order to reinforce the radio proposition to both listeners and 
advertisers, we continue to leverage on the evolution of media and 
technological trends. We provide users with a 360° reach via on air 
and digital platforms as well as campaigns with dynamic and 
relevant digital solutions.

brand equity, numerous on-ground events were held during the 
year. hitz.fm celebrated its 15th birthday anniversary at a packed 
Stadium Putra, Bukit Jalil, with a concert featuring the best of 
Malaysia’s local talents. The MY FM birthday bash, a much talked-
about annual event, was attended by more than 25,000 fans with 
a lineup of artistes which included singers from Taiwan, China and 
local artists. Birthday bashes were also held in Kuching and Kota 
Kinabalu to celebrate hitz.fm, MY FM and ERA FM’s 2-year presence 
in East Malaysia. In October 2012, ERA FM was the title sponsor 
for Piala Malaysia and in conjunction with the final match of the 
tournament, we organised a mini concert for more than 10,000 
football fans. Over the year, we have also worked with corporate 
clients to produce brand campaign events which incorporated on-
air and on the ground events.
360° content ideation
In order to enhance the standard of our services to clients, internal 
client-specific discussions were held on a daily basis, with 
representation from Integration, Sales and Content teams. We 
worked with our TV, Publications and Digital colleagues from the 
wider Astro group in campaign proposals, examples of which 
include the Shell Fuel Save campaign, Wall’s Cornetto 
u
da & Dara, 
ERA Piala Malaysia and Maharaja Lawak.
Annual client satisfaction studies were also conducted to gauge 
and measure the standard of Astro Radio’s services delivered to our 
client base. These studies helped pinpoint areas for improvements

and benchmarked us against other operators in a continuous effort 
to out-serve our clients. In addition, weekly internal music research 
was conducted in partnership with an Australian research company, 
leading to an annual listener-driven music and perceptual study for 
all Astro Radio stations to ensure that the highest standard of 
content is consistently delivered to our listeners.
Astro’s homegrown radio talent
We actively develop our own radio hosts, whom we believe 
contribute to the quality of our in-house radio content production. 
Almost all of our radio hosts appear exclusively on our radio 
programming across a variety of genres, including general 
entertainment, music, news and sports programming. Some of our 
radio hosts such as Johan, who has developed a funny and 
spontaneous character which has made him one of the most 
famous local comedians in Malaysia. Jack Lim and Mei Yan are the 
all-time favourites on the Chinese radio scene and also regularly 
appear in local Chinese movies. Johan, Jack and Mei also star on 
Astro TV programmes. Jin Lim, or more popularly known as Jin from 
hitz.fm has taken the social media platform by storm with his 
hilarious video “ Abuden” which has generated over 1.5 million views 
on JinnyboyTV. Aanantha, formerly a music rock star, where he 
sang and played a string of musical instruments, is now involved in 
stage and film acting.

Publications
Overview
With 8 commercial magazines and 
AstroView, Astro Publications continues to 
develop itself as a major player in 
publications. 
Our TV viewing guide, AstroView is published 
in 3 languages, and is Malaysia’s most 
widely circulated magazine with more than 
5 million copies circulated per annum. At 
the 6th Magazine Publishers Association 
(MPA) Magazine Awards 2012, our 
magazines bagged gold, silver and bronze 
awards. Our English titles – FourFourTwo, 
FHM and Style won Gold awards in their 
respective categories. iFeel and Men’s Uno 
won Silver awards, whilst InTrend and 
AstroView won Bronze awards in their 
categories.
Added to this is our latest stamp in the 
digital space which includes flourishing 
websites and the development of 
e-magazines. Astro Publications is vitally 
geared for the future of content consumption 
in the new media scene.
We continue to refresh our publications portfolio by adding 
new titles and interactive digital formats that enhance our 
value proposition to existing and prospective readers, as 
well as increase our relevance to advertisers.
New publications
During the financial year, we launched three 
new publications. 
CAR, a U K-based premium motoring 
magazine, was launched in December 2012. 
Established as a benchmark motoring title 
that affluent car enthusiasts gravitate 
towards, advertisers’ confidence in CAR 
Malaysia in the lead-up to the inaugural 
issue was highly encouraging. 
Following on from Astro’s successful TV series 
and No. 1 educational brand, Oh My English!, 
we launched a print version of the series in 
October 2012. Largely based on its TV 
counterpart, the bookazine aims to inject fun 
in learning and improving the use of the 
English language by using topics that centre 
on food, health, career and money. We have 
also distributed 50,000 free copies of the 
bookazine to 50 schools nationwide as part 
of our corporate responsibility initiatives. 
Working hand in hand with Astro TV, we 
published the Go Beyond coffee table book. 
The book aims to encourage all Malaysians 
to embrace the Go Beyond spirit.
Astro Publications is targeting to further 
grow its publications portfolio, in both local 
and international titles, in 2013.
An evolving commercial proposition
Astro Publications continues to provide 
synergies and significant media-bundling 
opportunities with our TV, radio and digital 
initiatives.
Whilst our publication business is currently 
small relative to the other business units in 
terms of advertising revenue generation, it 
enables us to provide an option for 
advertisers to advertise via print and 
e-media, thereby building upon our strategy 
of providing an integrated media 
advertisement solution to our advertisers.
We also envisage significant growth through 
leveraging our base of 3.5 million TV 
customers. By providing targeted, value-

360° in content publication
The publications scene has expanded to the 
digital space, and Astro Publications is 
uniquely positioning itself to ride this wave 
of growth. 
Four brand new websites were launched in 
December 2012 – www.intrend.com.my, 
www.ifeel.com.my, www.fhm.com.my and 
www.carmalaysia.my, the latter being ready 
in time for the launch date of the print 
version. Over and above this, the team is 
currently working on at least three stand-
alone e-magazines, two of which are 
original intellectual properties targeted to 
launch by the end of 2013.
We will activate an e-version of all our 
current and future print properties, and 
bring to bear the Group’s investments in 
content and in technology to create 
compelling digital brands. These interactive 
e-versions will include engaging features to 
fully involve our consumers, and will be 
complemented by video and audio content 
from within the group.

Digital
We are setting the stage for 
a new wave of integrated 
and transformative content 
experiences.

Extending beyond
Today, the digital space is catalysing growth in content 
consumption and engagement. While TV viewing in households 
still stays strong and continues to grow, we see that Malaysians 
are increasingly connected and equipped with smart devices; and 
they are using these devices to enhance their viewing experience 
and also significantly grow their personal engagement with 
content brands that they trust and love. 
‘Go Beyond’ for Astro is more than just making our TV, radio and 
publications content multi-platform and accessible anytime, 
anywhere. Digital is a route to innovating how we deliver content, 
engage customers and enhance our customer experience, as well 
as an opportunity to increase our share of the individual’s media 
consumption.
Content 360°
Through our websites and mobile applications, we have continued 
to hone our approach to delivering 360° content experiences 
across our TV, radio and print content brands. 
In January 2013, we had 2.2 million unique users to our websites, 
a 33% increase from one year ago for astro.com.my. Page views 
grew more than two-fold, from 7.2 million to 15.5 million. This 
growth was driven by the continued evolution and development 
of our astro.com.my portal, Stadium Astro, Astro Radio websites 
and other vernacular content portals such as Gempak, Zhongwen 
and Ulagam. Improvements like our development of the first 
online Malaysian FA Football Fantasy League and our Astro Chef 
mobile app captured users’ interest, and delivered increased 
audiences. There are over 129,000 registered football fantasy 
players and our mobile apps have recorded 2.7 million total 
downloads through the year. 
Digital video and audio consumption was a key development for 
Astro during the year. AOTG was launched in June 2012, and saw 
over 250,000 registered users and over 4.1 million video views by 
the end of January 2013. On YouTube, we were able to expand 
the reach of our NJOI channels and promote key content brands, 
to deliver over 91 million video views from March 2012 to the 
end of January 2013. Our digital radio stations are available in 
AOTG, mobile apps and online, with over 287  million streamed 
listening sessions.

---- Page 91 ----
89 ASTRO MALAYSIA HOLDING BERHAD
annual report 2013
The growth in engagement came from a focus on delivering 360° 
experiences for signature content such as Oh My English!, Maharaja 
Lawak, Barclays Premier League, Malaysian FA football, Celebrity 
Masterchef, and more.
Our digital ambition
We are focused on ensuring that we are at the forefront of exploring 
and making digital a profitable platform for content monetisation 
in the future.
Our digital investments are targeted at making our TV, radio, 
publications, and interactive content experiences increasingly 
seamless and integrated. Our roadmap includes enhancing the 
digital user experience for all of our products, as well as investing 
in advertising infrastructure and customer insight tools to deliver 
multi-platform digital campaigns. While the digital space in 
Malaysia is still in its infancy, with print spend still the largest 
segment of adex, we are intent on positioning Astro to be the 
winner in the migration to digital advertising spend that is highly 
likely to materialise.
In order to ensure we are increasing our share of digital audiences 
this year, we aim to deliver great companion apps that allow 
customers to not just watch on their smart devices but also control 
their TV experience or engage with interactive content while 
watching on TV. We will continue to create more mobile and online 
experiences for our signature content, such as Oh My English!, 
Adam & Hawa, and more. In addition, we will increasingly enable 
customers to transact virtually all their service needs online at their 
convenience.
u
ltimately, digital is an opportunity for Astro to advance our core 
mission with customers – give them fantastic content through great 
product and service experiences, via any platform that we can. We 
see a tremendous potential to innovate those experiences for 
customers, and to put Astro in a stronger position to satisfy future 
consumer needs and desires.

Every customer expects a great experience, excellent service and 
world-class content. As part of our commitment and efforts to 
continuously improve and innovate, we engage with our customers 
through a myriad of customer touch points to help us drive 
improvements to our customer experience. This is further 
complemented with the understanding of customer feedback, 
profile and customer behaviour; and applying what is learned inside 
the organisation to drive the improvements. 
Doing Business with Astro
Our Code of Business Ethics outlines the practice and standards for 
our vendors, contractors and suppliers must undertake in their 
dealings with us and covers matters related to business ethics, 
record keeping, questionable payments, conflict of interest, dealing 
with business interest or relationships outside the company,

Where required, suppliers need to have a robust business continuity 
plan to ensure minimal disruption in the supply of goods and 
services as well as to comply with Environmental Preferable 
Procurement guidelines by utilising alternative materials whenever 
cost effective. 
Creating Responsible Content
We endeavour to comply with the Communications & Multimedia 
Act 1998, to ensure all content broadcasted via our TV channels 
and radio channels adheres to the Content Code. We also take into 
consideration the nature of the broadcasting channels, the theme 
of the content and the likely audience. 
u
ser self-regulation tools 
like the Electronic Programming Guide and parental lock are also 
available to ensure that our customers are able to make an 
informed choice as to the content they wish to view or block from 
viewing. In order to address the diversity of our audience, 
programmes can be subtitled into four languages, namely Bahasa 
Malaysia, English, Mandarin and Tamil. Regulatory compliance

Info-zone segment. Traffic reports, which average 15 minutes per 
day per station, and travel advisories, are included as CSAs too.

Given our wide range of content and its accessibility, our customers 
who are parents may wish to have control over their children’s TV 
viewing. Our Parental Lock feature of the Astro decoder allows 
parents to manage their children’s viewing by blocking access to 
certain channels by setting a Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
to lock or unlock these channels. Our content rating systems are 
also attached to our television programmes to give viewers an idea 
of the suitability of each show.

diReCTo R s’ REPORT  (CONT’D.)
for the financial year ended 31 January 2013
STATUTORY I NFORMATION ON  THE  F INANCIAL  S TATEMENTS
Before the income statements, statements of comprehensive income and balance sheets of the Group and Company were made out, the 
Directors took reasonable steps:
(a)
 t
o ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful 
debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for 
doubtful debts; and
(b)
 t
o ensure that any current assets, other than debts, which were unlikely to realise in the ordinary course of business their values as 
shown in the accounting records of the Group and Company had been written down to an amount which they might be expected 
so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(a) which 
would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial 
statements of the Group and Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(b)
 which 
would render the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and Company misleading; or
(c)
 which hav
e arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and Company 
misleading or inappropriate.
No contingent or other liability has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the 
end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Group or the Company 
to meet their obligations when they fall due.
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(a)
 an
y charge on the assets of the Group or Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liability 
of any other person; or
(b)
 an
y contingent liability of the Group or Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year, other than as disclosed in 
Note 42 to the financial statements.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial 
statements which would render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL sTATeMeNTs 
– 31 January 2013
1 G ENERAL  I NFORMATION
 T he principal activity of the Company is investment holding. The Company had on 18 July 2012 converted its status from a private 
limited company to a public limited company and henceforth, its name has been changed to Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad 
(“ AMH”). On 19 October 2012, the Company was listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The Group is 
primarily engaged in the provision of television services, radio services, film library licensing, television content, creation, aggregation 
and distribution and multimedia interactive services. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are as disclosed in Note 14 to the 
financial statements.
 T
here were no significant changes in the nature of these activities of the Group and the Company during the financial year.
 T
he Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group.
 T
he Company was incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia. The Directors regard Astro Holdings Sdn. Bhd. (“ AHSB”) and Astro 
Networks (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (“ ANM”), both companies incorporated in Malaysia, as the Group’s and Company’s ultimate and 
immediate holding companies respectively. Related companies in the financial statements refer to companies within the AHSB group 
of companies.
 T
he address of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company is as follows:

2 F INANCIAL  R ISK  M ANAGEMENT  O BJECTIVES  AND  P OLICIES
 T he Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and cash flow risk. The Group’s overall financial risk management objective is to minimise potential adverse effects on 
the financial performance of the Group.
 T
he Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts and a mixture of fixed and 
floating interest rate instruments to hedge certain exposures.
(a)
 F
oreign currency exchange risk
 
  T
he Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of the foreign currency transactions entered into by the 
Group in currencies other than its functional currency. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to limit exposure 
to currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings, and on cash flows generated from anticipated 
transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
(b)
 Inter
est rate risk
 
  T
he Group’s interest rate exposure arises principally from the Group’s trade payables and borrowings. The interest rate risk is 
managed through the use of fixed and floating interest rate instruments.

(c) Cr edit risk
 
  T
he Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Customer credit risk exposure is managed with a combination of credit 
limits and arrears monitoring procedures. Deposits of cash are placed only with financial institutions with strong short-term credit 
ratings and investments in unit trusts are made only in cash/money market i.e. very liquid funds.
(d)
 Liquidit
y and cash flow risk
 
  Pr
udent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding through an adequate 
amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the Group’s treasury aims at 
maintaining flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit facilities available and if necessary, obtaining additional debt and 
equity funding.
(e)
 C
apital risk 
 
  T
he Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
 
  T
he Group and Company will balance their overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues as well 
as the issue of new debt or the repayment of existing borrowings.
(f)
 F
air value estimation
 
  T
he fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. The 
Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet 
date. Estimated discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
 
 F
urther details on financial risks are disclosed in Note 39.

3 S UMMARY  OF  S IGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  P OLICIES  (C ONT ’ D.)
A Basis of preparation (Cont’d.)
The financial statements of the Group and the Company for the year ended 31 January 2013 are the first annual set of 
financial statements prepared in accordance with the MFRS, including MFRS 1, ‘First-time Adoption of Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards’. Subject to certain transition elections disclosed in Note 46, the Group and Company have consistently 
applied the same accounting policies in its opening MFRS statements of financial position at 1 February 2011 (transition date) 
and throughout all years presented, as if these policies had always been in effect. Save for the required presentation of three 
statements of financial position in the first MFRS financial statements, there is no other significant impact on the Group’s and 
Company’s financial results and position, and changes to the accounting policies of the Group and Company arising from the 
adoption of this MFRS Framework as the requirements under the previous Financial Reporting Standards (“FRS”) Framework were 
equivalent to the MFRS Framework. 
The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (‘000), 
unless otherwise indicated.
In the prior financial year, the Group’s acquisitions of Measat Broadcast Network Systems Sdn. Bhd. (“MBNS”) and its subsidiary, 
Measat Digicast Sdn. Bhd. (“MDIG”), were accounted for based on the capital reorganisation method whilst the remaining 
subsidiaries were acquired based on the acquisition method. The difference between the consideration and the net assets of 
MBNS and MDIG at the date of capital reorganisation was taken to the capital reorganisation reserve, resulting in a negative 
reserve balance of RM5,470,197,000 at 31 January 2013 and 31 January 2012. The acquisition of the remaining subsidiaries 
was recognised in accordance with section 3B(a) below. As a result of different methods used, the comparative results of the 
Group are based on the full period results of MBNS and MDIG whilst the remaining subsidiaries’ results were recognised from 
the date of acquisition.
MBNS has been identified as the accounting acquirer for these business combinations. Accordingly, although the consolidated 
financial statements have been prepared in the name of the Company being the legal parent, they are in substance a 
continuation of the consolidated financial statements of the legal subsidiary, MBNS and its subsidiary MDIG. The share capital 
shown in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including comparatives, is the legal structure of the Company. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of certain 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reported year. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgment in the process of applying the Group and 
Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgment are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of current 
events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where 
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.

 MFRS 
10 “Consolidated Financial Statements” (effective from 1 January 2013) changes the definition of control. 
An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. It establishes control as 
the basis for determining which entities are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements and sets out the 
accounting requirements for the preparation of consolidated financial statements. It replaces all the guidance on 
control and consolidation in MFRS 127 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” and IC Interpretation 
112 “Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities”. 
• MFRS 
12 “Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities” (effective from 1 January 2013) sets out the required 
disclosures for entities reporting under the two new standards, MFRS 10 and MFRS 11, and replaces the disclosure 
requirements currently found in MFRS 128 “Investments in associates”. It requires entities to disclose information 
that helps financial statement readers to evaluate the nature, risks and financial effects associated with the 
entity’s interests in subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and unconsolidated structured entities.

13 “Fair Value Measurement” (effective from 1 January 2013) aims to improve consistency and reduce 
complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and 
disclosure requirements for use across MFRSs. The requirements do not extend the use of fair value accounting but 
provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards. 
The enhanced disclosure requirements are similar to those in MFRS 7 “Financial instruments: Disclosures”, but 
apply to all assets and liabilities measured at fair value, not just financial ones.

9 “Financial Instruments – Classification and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” 
(effective from 1 January 2015) replaces the multiple classification and measurement models in MFRS 139 
with a single model that has only two classification categories: amortised cost and fair value. The basis of 
classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash 
flow characteristics of the financial asset. 
 T
he accounting and presentation for financial liabilities and for de-recognising financial instruments has been 
relocated from MFRS 139, without change, except for financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through 
profit or loss (“FVTPL”). Entities with financial liabilities designated at FVTPL recognise changes in the fair value 
due to changes in the liability’s credit risk directly in other comprehensive income (OCI). There is no subsequent 
recycling of the amounts in OCI to profit or loss, but accumulated gains or losses may be transferred within equity.

entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are de-consolidated from 
the date that control ceases.

u
nder the acquisition method of accounting, as adopted on acquisition of commonly controlled companies, the cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at 
the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of the non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost 
of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in 
the income statement.
 Int
er-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. 
u
nrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure 
consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
 (b)
 T
ransactions with non-controlling interests
 Non-c
ontrolling interests are measured at their share of the post acquisition fair values of the identifiable assets and 
liabilities of the invested entities. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributable to the equity holders of the 
Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 (
c)
 Associates
 Associat
es are entities over which the Group generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or over which the 
Group has significant influence over their operating and financial policies, but over which it does not have control.
 In
vestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The 
Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill (net of accumulated impairment) on acquisition. 
u
nder this method, the 
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of associates is recognised in the income statement and its share of 
post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the cost of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless the Group has incurred obligations or amounts owing by the 
associate.
 
u
nrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the associates. 
u
nrealised losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
policies adopted by the Group.
 Dilution gains and losses arising in in
vestments in associates are recognised in the income statement.

 Jointly 
controlled entities 
Jointly controlled entities are corporations, partnerships or other entities over which there is contractually agreed sharing of 
control by the Group with one or more parties.
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Equity 
accounting involves recognising in the income statement the Group’s share of the results of jointly controlled entities for 
the period. The Group’s investments in jointly controlled entities are carried in the balance sheet at an amount that reflects 
its share of the net assets of the jointly controlled entities and includes any long term interests.
u
nrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the jointly controlled entities. 
u
nrealised losses are also eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered.
Where necessary, adjustments have been made to the financial statements of jointly controlled entities to ensure 
consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group.
C
 P
roperty, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to write off the cost of each asset to the residual value over its estimated 
useful life. Leased assets capitalised are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or lease period, whichever is shorter. 
The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:
Buildings
 40 y
ears
Satellite transponders
 15 y
ears
Equipment, fixtures and fittings
 4 
– 10 years
Broadcast and transmission equipment
 3 – 10 y
ears
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful life.
Included in broadcast and transmission equipment are set-top boxes and outdoor dish units (collectively called “HD set-top 
boxes”) used to provide the Astro High Definition Services (“ Astro B.yond”) to Astro subscribers. These specific HD set-top boxes 
remain the property of the Group after installation, and are recovered if the subscriber contract is terminated. The HD set-top 
boxes are capitalised and depreciated over their useful economic life of 3 years.
No depreciation is calculated on assets under construction until the assets are completed and are ready for their intended use.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an 
analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. The assets’ residual values and 
useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. A write down is made if the carrying amount 
exceeds the recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(G) on impairment of non-financial assets.

Interest costs on borrowings to finance the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost 
of the asset during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing

eases
 (
a)
 F
inance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
classified as finance leases. 
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property or the 
present value of the minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges 
so as to achieve a periodic constant rate on the balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance 
charges, are included as part of borrowings.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated according to the basis set out in Note 3(C).
 (b)
 Oper
ating leases
Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to 
the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.

 Goodwill
Goodw
ill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition of a subsidiary/associate/jointly controlled entity over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/associate/jointly controlled entity at 
the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisition of 
investments accounted for using the equity method is included in the investments. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject 
to an annual review for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is charged to 
the income statement as it arises. The calculation of the gains and losses on the disposal takes into account the carrying 
amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which 
the goodwill arose, identified according to operating segment.

omputer software 
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group and that will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Costs associated 
with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software programmes beyond their original 
specifications is recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software. Computer software 
costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated useful economic lives of 3 – 7 
years. Amortisation is included in cost of sales, administrative expenses and marketing and distribution costs as appropriate.
 (

 Soft
ware development
No amortisation is calculated on software development until the software is completed and is ready for its intended used.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee 
costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria 
are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as 
an asset in a subsequent period.
At each balance sheet date, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully 
recoverable. A write down is made if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(G) 
on impairment of non-financial assets.

Brands acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. The brands have an 
indefinite useful life and are not amortised, but are subject to annual review for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Any impairment is charged to income statement as it arises.
The useful lifes of the brands are estimated to be indefinite based on a strong position in the market and the clear 
precedence of similar radio companies which have adopted an indefinite life for the radio brands. Management believes 
there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the brands are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.

ilm library and programme rights (Cont’d.)
Amortisation of film library is on an individual film basis based on the proportion of the actual revenue earned during the 
financial year over the estimated total revenue expected to be earned over the revenue period, not exceeding three years, 
commencing from the date when revenue is first generated. Estimated ultimate revenue expected to be earned is reviewed 
periodically and additional impairment losses are recognised if appropriate. Amortisation is included in cost of sales.
The cost of film under production comprises expenditure incurred in the production of films and is stated at cost. The 
amortisation of the cost incurred for the production in progress will commence in the period that the motion pictures are 
screened in the cinemas. 
The programme rights comprise rights licensed from third parties and programmes produced for the Group and production 
in progress with the primary intention to broadcast in the normal course of the Group’s operating cycle. The rights are 
stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
The Group amortises programme rights based on an accelerated basis over the license period, or estimated useful life if 
shorter, from the date of first transmission, to match the costs of consumption with the estimated benefits to be received. 
Amortisation is included in cost of sales. The amortisation period is not more than three years.
The cost of programme rights for sports are amortised on a straight-line basis over a season or annually, depending on the 
expected consumption of the rights. Live and one-off events are fully amortised on the date of first transmission. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an 
analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. A write down is made if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 3(G) on impairment of non-financial assets.

 Impairment 
of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested annually for impairment. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are 
separately identifiable cash flows (Cash Generating Units).

The impairment loss is charged to the income statement unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged to 
the revaluation surplus. In respect of other assets, any subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the income 
statement unless it reverses an impairment loss on a revalued asset in which case it is taken to revaluation surplus.
H
 i
nventories
Inventories which principally comprise tapes, set-top boxes used in the provision of non-subscription services and other materials 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method. Where appropriate, allowance is made for obsolete or slow-
moving inventories based on management’s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts.
Net realisable value reflects the value to the business of the set-top boxes in the hands of the customer. 
I
 Borr
owings
Borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective yield method; any difference between the initial carrying value and 
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement using the effective yield method over the period of the borrowings.
J
 Curr
ent and deferred taxation
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the 
reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts attributed to assets 
and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted 
for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the 
related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures except where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.

Termination benefits may be paid whenever an employee’s employment is terminated before the normal retirement date.

current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or to provide termination benefits 
as a result of an invitation made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

d)
 Shar
e-based payment transactions
The Group and Company operate an equity settled share-based compensation plan. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the share awards is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase to equity. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards 
granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At the end of each financial reporting period, the 
Company revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest and recognises the impact of the 
revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The fair value of the share awards is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model. Measurement inputs include share 
price on measurement date, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected 
due to publicly available information), expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate (based on Malaysian Government 
Securities yield).

The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability 
is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare circumstances where there is a liability 
that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by uncertain future events 
beyond the control of the Group. The Group discloses the existence of contingent assets where inflows of economic benefits 
are probable, but not virtually certain.
O

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, when it 
is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate of 
the amount can be made.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.

inancial assets at FVTPL are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired 
principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they 
are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets.
 
 (ii)
 Loans 
and receivables
 
 L
oans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted 
in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months from the 
balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets. They are included in Receivables and Prepayments in 
the balance sheet at amortised cost.

vailable-for-sale financial assets (“AFS”)
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any 
of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends 
to dispose of it within twelve months of the end of the reporting period. 
 
 (iv)
 HTM 
investments
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities are classified as held-to-
maturity when the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold it to maturity. They are classified as non-current 
assets when the remaining maturities are more than twelve months and as current assets when the remaining 
maturities are less than twelve months. They are included in Financial Assets in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
 (b)
 R
ecognition and measurement
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date – the date on which the Group commits to 
purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not 
carried at FVTPL. Financial assets carried at FVTPL are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed 
in the income statement. FVTPL are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity financial 
assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. AFS are subsequently carried at fair 
value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of AFS are recognised in other comprehensive income, except that 
impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary instruments, interest and dividends are recognised in 
the income statement.
 (
c)
 Subsequent 
measurement – Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets carried at amortised cost are impaired when there is objective evidence as a result of one or more events 
that the present value of estimated discounted future cash flows is lower than the carrying value. Any impairment losses 
are recognised immediately in the income statement. Financial assets are continuously monitored and allowances are 
applied against financial assets on a collective basis based on the Group and Company’s historical loss experiences for the 
relevant aged category.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an 
event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement.
When an asset is uncollectible, it is written off against the related allowance account. Such assets are written off after all 
the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined.

 Subsequent 
measurement – Impairment of financial assets (Cont’d.)
The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s 
original effective interest rate. The asset’s carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised 
in profit or loss. If ‘loans and receivables’ have a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss 
is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.
The Group and Company may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market 
price.
 (
d)
 Der
ecognition
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been 
transferred and the Group and Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
When AFS are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss.
T
 F
inancial liabilities
Financial liabilities within the scope of FRS139 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” are recognised on the 
balance sheet when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, plus, in the case of financial liabilities other than derivatives, directly 
attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value. Other financial liabilities (except for financial guarantee) 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For financial liabilities other than derivatives, gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are 
derecognised, and through the amortisation process. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are 
recognised in the income statement. Net gains or losses on derivatives include exchange differences.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial liability is 
replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.

U Deriv ative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
at their fair values. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a 
hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as 
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its 
assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in the financial statements. Movements 
on the hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are shown in the Statements of Changes in Equity. The full fair value of a hedging 
derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve 
months and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months. Trading 
derivatives are classified as current assets or liabilities.
 (
a)
 C
ash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss. However, when a forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains 
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the asset.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is 
ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative 
gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
 (b)
 Deriv
atives at FVTPL
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the 
income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives 
when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried 
at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.

V  e arnings per or dinary share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS are calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS are determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding adjusted for own shares held for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise share awards granted to employees.
w 
o
perating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. 
An operating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker comprising the Board 
of Directors, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which 
discrete financial information is available.
4 C RITICAL  ACCOUNTING  E STIMATES  AND  J UDGEMENTS
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
outlined below. 
(a)
 P
roperty, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the assets’ useful lives. The useful lives 
of these assets estimated by the management are as disclosed in Note 3(C) to the financial statements. The assets’ residual 
values are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
In relation to the HD set-top boxes, the capitalised costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment, which 
is based on management’s judgement of the risk of technical obsolescence and expected churn rates. Due to the inherent 
difficulty of making the estimate, the estimated useful life of the HD set-top boxes may change based on, amongst other things, 
changes in technology as well as responses to competitive conditions.
(b)
 P
rogramme rights
The Group amortises programme rights based on an accelerated basis over the license period, or estimated useful life if shorter, 
from the date of first transmission, to match the costs of consumption with the estimated benefits to be received as disclosed 
in Note 3E(e).  The estimated benefits to be received are based on the management’s estimates of the number of times a 
programme will be broadcast and the relative value associated with each broadcast.
During the financial year, the Group revised its estimates in relation to the amortisation of certain programme rights based 
on the forecast period for the consumption of the rights licensed from a third party. The impact of the change on the Group’s 
income statement for the year is an increase of RM20.5 million in profit before tax.

Goodwill and brands which are indefinite life intangible assets, are allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs)

The goodwill and brands have been recorded following various acquisitions as highlighted in Note 21 to the financial statements, 
which were completed in the prior financial year. 
The recoverable amount of the CGUs was determined based on a value in use basis and no impairment was identified during 
the financial year.
The recoverable amount reflects past experience of the transaction value for the related CGUs, including observable comparable 
market transactions and cash flow projections of the CGUs. The cash flow projections are based on the Board approved 
budget for the next financial year and the strategic plan covering a five year period, after which a long term growth rate of 
the respective markets has been applied. The projection period has been determined to reflect the completion of the projected 
investment cycle of the respective businesses. Management has considered external information in completing the budget 
and strategic plan, including forecast economic indicators for the Malaysian market as well as the competitive landscape and 
potential changes in technology.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections from

The calculations of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to pre-tax discount rates. Pre-tax discount rates reflect the current 
market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU. This is the benchmark used by management to assess operating performance 
and to evaluate future investment proposals. In determining appropriate discount rates for each CG

egard has been given to the 
Malaysian 20-year risk free rate with Malaysia’s long term CPI.

historical experience in collection of accounts receivable falls within the recorded allowances.

Forward foreign currency exchange contracts
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage the foreign currency exposures arising from the Group’s receivables 
and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group. Most of the forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date. The notional principal amounts of the 
outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts at 31 January 2013 were 
u
SD85,949,000 (31.1.2012: 
u
SD46,010,000; 
1.2.2011: 
u
SD41,640,000).
Interest rate swap
Interest rate swap is used to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating interest rate exposure within the Group’s policy. The

During the year, the Group has entered into the following related party transactions with parties whose relationships are set out 
below.
Usaha Tegas Sdn. Bhd. (“UTSB”), Khazanah Nasional Berhad (“KNB”) and Harapan Terus Sdn. Bhd. are parties related to the 
Company, by virtue of having joint control over ANM via AHSB (the Company’s ultimate holding company), pursuant to a 
shareholders’ agreement in relation to AHSB. ANM is the immediate holding company of the Company.
UTSB is ultimately controlled by PanOcean Management Limited (“PanOcean”), via Excorp Holdings N.V. and Pacific States Investment 
Limited, the intermediate and immediate holding companies of 
u
TSB respectively. PanOcean is the trustee of a discretionary trust, 
the beneficiaries of which are members of the family of Ananda Krishnan Tatparanandam (“TAK”) and foundations including those 
for charitable purposes. Although PanOcean and TAK are deemed to have an interest in the shares of the Company through 
u
TSB’s 
deemed interest in AHSB and ANM, they do not have any economic or beneficial interest in the shares as such interest is held subject 
to the terms of the discretionary trust.
TAK also has a deemed interest in the shares of the Company via entities which are the direct shareholders of AHSB and held by 
companies ultimately controlled by TAK.
In addition to related party disclosures mentioned elsewhere in the financial statements, set out below are other significant 
transactions and balances. The related party transactions described below were carried out on agreed terms with the related parties.

The Group and Company are exposed to credit risk arising from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
 T
rade receivables
Concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the Group’s large number of customers. The 
Directors believe that there is no additional credit exposure above the amounts provided.
The credit quality of trade receivables that were neither past due nor impaired as at the balance sheet date, can be assessed 
by reference to historical information relating to counterparty default rates:

Impairment of receivables has been made by considering the impact of the historical collection trend, credit term, payment 
terms and credit assessment towards the outstanding amount due.
 Other 
financial assets
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from 
default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
In addition, a majority of the Group’s deposits are placed with financial institutions with strong short-term credit rating in 
Malaysia. Investments in unit trusts are made in cash/money market, i.e. very liquid funds.
(b)
 Liquidit
y risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s exposure 
to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings.
The Group maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and bank facilities deemed adequate by the management to ensure, 
as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.

(c) Mark et risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other prices that will 
affect the Group’s financial position or cash flows.
 F
oreign currency sensitivity
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other 
than the respective functional currencies of the Group’s entities. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily 
u
SD.
The Group hedges its foreign currency denominated trade payables. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk. Most of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts have maturities of less 
than one year after the end of the balance sheet date. Where necessary, the forward foreign currency exchange contracts are 
rolled over at maturity. The Group has also entered into Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap (“CCIRS”) to mitigate financial risks 
arising from adverse fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The notional principal amount and maturity profiles of forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as at  
31 January 2013 and CCIRS are disclosed in Note 27 to the financial statements.
The following table provides the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the u
SD exchange rate, with all other variables 
held constant, of the Group and Company’s profit or loss before tax. The sensitivity analysis includes outstanding foreign 
currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 10% change in the exchange rate.

i
nterest rate sensitivity
The Group’s investments in fixed rate debt securities and its fixed to floating rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change 
in their fair value due to changes in interest rates. The Group’s variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in 
cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investments in equity securities and short term receivables and payables are not 
significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
The Group adopts a base line policy to hedge between 50% and 100% of its borrowing interest rate exposure from floating to 
fixed rate basis. The Group has entered into an Interest Rate Swap (“IRS”) contract for the RM2,010,000,000 Ringgit tranche 
facility to fix the floating interest rate at a weighted average rate of 4.01% and a CCIRS for the USD330,000,000 USD tranche 
facility to fix the floating USD interest rate at a weighted average Ringgit rate of 4.19%. The IRS and CCIRS will mature on 
19 May 2021 and 8 June 2021 respectively. The notional principal amount and maturity profiles of both IRS and CCIRS are 
disclosed in Note 27 to the financial statements.
The following table provides the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held 
constant, of the Group and Company’s profit or loss before tax. The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the impact on 
floating rate financial instruments at the end of the balance sheet date.

2 times for the purpose of borrowing covenants. During the financial year, the Group has complied with these requirements.
(e)
 F
air values
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. 
The Group and Company use a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at 
each balance sheet date. Estimated discounted cash flows are used to determine fair value for the financial instruments. The 
fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

 Claim b
y AV Asia Sdn. Bhd.
 On 
12 October 2010, MBNS was served with a claim by AV Asia Sdn. Bhd. (“ AV Asia”). Tele System Electronic (M) Sdn. 
Bhd. (“Tele System”) was named as second defendant. AV Asia is alleging that MBNS had breached the terms of a Mutual 
Non Disclosure Agreement dated 1 August 2008 (“MNDA”) and has sought the remedies which was detailed in the last 
financial statements.
 On 28 A
ugust 2012 the Federal Court had dismissed AV Asia’s application for leave to appeal against the stay of court 
proceedings pending reference to arbitration. This dispute will now have to be determined by arbitration.
 T
he Federal Court allowed AV Asia’s application for leave to appeal against the dismissal of the interlocutory injunction. 
The granting of such leave by the Federal Court does not in any way reflect the merits of the appeal. The date for the 
hearing of the appeal has not been fixed. Following consultation with its solicitors, MBNS is of the view that MBNS has 
good grounds to successfully oppose the substantive appeal as the principles relating to the discretion of the Court in 
granting an injunction are settled and have been correctly applied to the facts by both the High Court and the Court of 
Appeal.

 On 
23 October 2012, MBNS filed a notice of arbitration at the KLRCA, seeking amongst others, a declaration that MBNS

the notice of arbitration filed by MBNS, as of 31 January 2013, the arbitral tribunal has been fully constituted. Following 
consultation with its solicitors, MBNS is of the view that MBNS has good grounds to successfully obtain the relief sought 
in its notice of arbitration and a good defence to AV Asia’s counter claim, which was raised in its response to the notice 
of arbitration. The quantum of the counter claim is believed to be unrealistic and the chances of recovery are considered 
remote.

 P
T Ayunda Prima Mitra (“PT APM”) Claim
 On 
11 March 2005, AOL (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAAN) and certain of its affiliate companies (“ AOL Companies”) and 
PT Ayunda Prima Mitra (“PTAPM”), PT First Media Tbk (“PTFM”) and PT Direct Vision (“PTDV”) entered into a conditional 
Subscription and Shareholders Agreement (“SSA”) to set up a DTH pay-TV business in Indonesia to be launched by PTDV. 
PTAPM was a shareholder of PTDV and PTFM was the holding company of PTAPM.
 In anticipation of the c
onclusion of the intended joint venture and upon the request of PTAPM and PTFM, the AOL 
Companies agreed to provide and/or procure the provision to PTDV of funds and services to launch the pay-TV business of 
PTDV in February 2006, with the support of services and equipment from AAAN, MBNS and All Asia Multimedia Networks 
FZ-LLC (“ AAMN”) (Following the AHSB Group Reorganisation, MBNS became part of AMH Group. AAAN, AAMN and AOL 
are not part of AMH Group).
 T
he conditions precedent to the SSA was never completed and the SSA lapsed on 31 July 2006. The parties then 
commenced negotiations to re-structure the proposed joint venture.
 As it bec
ame clear that a restructured joint venture could not be concluded, AAAN, AAMN and MBNS decided to 
terminate the provision of all support and services to PTDV in October 2008.
 In 
September 2008, PTAPM filed a claim by way of a civil suit in the South Jakarta District Court (“SJDC”) naming as 
defendants, AAAN, MBNS, AAMN, Augustus Ralph Marshall, our Non-Independent Non-Executive Deputy Chairman and 
nine others.
 P
TAPM alleged that AAAN, MBNS and AAMN (collectively “ Astro Defendants”) along with the other defendants, have 
acted unlawfully and sought, among other reliefs, to compel a continuation of the provision of services and equipment 
to PTDV for an unlimited duration and to prohibit AAAN from ceasing the provision of services to PTDV and/or entering 
into any cooperation with any other party relating to subscriber pay-TV in Indonesia, and an award of damages of 
approximately USD1.75 billion plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The Astro Defendants filed a challenge stating 
that the SJDC has no jurisdiction to hear the claim and that the claim falls within the scope of a binding arbitration 
agreement set out in the SSA.

 On 
13 May 2009, the SJDC rejected the Astro Defendants’ challenge that PTAPM’s claim fell within the scope of a binding 
arbitration agreement set out in the SSA and held that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute and subsequently, the SJDC 
had on 17 September 2009 dismissed PTAPM’s claim on grounds that PTAPM had no legal standing to bring the action 
against the Astro Defendants.
 P
TAPM filed an appeal against the SJDC’s decision in dismissing its claim. The Astro Defendants also filed an appeal 
against the SJDC’s finding on jurisdiction of the court. In September 2011, the Jakarta High Court issued a decision 
upholding the decisions of the SJDC rendered on 13 May 2009 and 17 September 2009, respectively. The Astro 
Defendants had, in June 2012, filed an appeal against the decision of the Jakarta High Court on the issue of jurisdiction. 
The outcome of this appeal is still pending.

 SIA
C Arbitration
 Pur
suant to the SSA, the parties to the SSA had agreed that any dispute arising out of or in relation to the proposed 
investment in PTDV shall be resolved by way of arbitration commenced by any party to the SSA through the Singapore 
International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”), which award shall be final and binding upon them.
 In 
October 2008, the AOL Companies, AAAN, AAMN, and MBNS (“Claimants”) commenced arbitration under the 
Arbitration Rules of the SIAC against PTAPM, PTDV and PTFM (“Respondents”) claiming injunctive and declaratory reliefs, 
damages and the recovery of all monies due to the Claimants for the provision of services and/or amount expended or 
paid to PTDV, together with interest and costs.
 
u
pon receiving evidence and hearing the counsels for the parties, the arbitration tribunal unanimously decided in favour 
of the Claimants and made the following awards:
(a)
 A
ward on preliminary issues of jurisdiction, interim anti-suit injunction and joinder dated 7 May 2009 (“Preliminary 
Award”) inter alia, ordering that PTAPM immediately discontinue its suit at the SJDC against among others, AAAN, 
MBNS, AAMN and Augustus Ralph Marshall, our Non-Independent Non-Executive Deputy Chairman (see (ii) above);
(b)  F
urther Partial Award dated 3 October 2009 whereby the arbitration tribunal declared that the SSA (which was 
never completed) was the only effective joint venture contract for PTDV and that it constituted the parties’ entire 
agreement for a PTDV joint venture, and that the Claimants themselves or through their affiliates are not bound to 
continue to provide cash advances or services to PTDV;
(c)  A
ward on costs dated 5 February 2010 for the preliminary hearing held from 20 to 24 April 2009, whereby the 
arbitration tribunal awarded costs to the Claimants and ordered that the Respondents pay to the Claimants the cost 
of the preliminary hearing, equivalent to approximately RM2,147,854 with interest at the rate of 5.33% per annum 
with effect from 6 October 2009;

u
SD234.5 million in restitution. Of this amount, PTAPM and PTFM were held jointly and severally liable with PTDV 
for the sum of approximately USD98.3 million. The arbitration tribunal further ordered as a final injunction, that 
PTAPM discontinue its civil suit at the SJDC (see item (ii) above), and not bring any proceedings in Indonesia or 
elsewhere against all the defendants in the said suit (which included the Astro Defendants) in respect of the PTDV 
joint venture. PTAPM and PTFM were also held jointly and severally liable to Astro Nusantara International B.V. 
and Astro Nusantara Holdings B.V . for the sum of approximately 
u S
D695,591.96 for damages arising from the 
Indonesian proceedings. PTAPM and PTFM were further ordered to indemnify Astro Nusantara International B.V. and 
Astro Nusantara Holdings B.V. for the benefit of AAAN, AAMN and MBNS against any losses suffered by reason of 
PTAPM’s continuance or by the pursuit of any proceedings in Indonesia or any replacement proceedings against the 
Claimants in so far as they relate to the joint venture agreement; and
(e)
 F
inal Award dated 3 August 2010 on interest and costs, requiring the Respondents to pay to the Claimants interest 
at the rate of 9% on semi-annual rests, 100% of the costs of arbitration and 80% of the legal costs claimed. The 
award on costs and interests is approximately 
u
SD68.6 million, of which PTFM’s liability is approximately 
u
SD28.6 
million;
 (the 
awards referred to in (b), (c), (d) and (e) are collectively referred to as “Remaining Awards”. The Preliminary Award 
and the Remaining Awards are collectively referred to as “ Awards”).
 P
TFM has refused to pay any part of the Awards, and the Awards remained unsatisfied.
 T
he Claimants are taking steps to enforce the Awards in Indonesia and in other appropriate territories that are signatories 
to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. To date, the Preliminary Award has 
been registered in England and Wales, and the Awards have been registered in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and 
Indonesia, and the Respondents had challenged and/or are challenging the enforcement efforts in Singapore, Hong Kong 
and Indonesia.
(iv)
 In 
Indonesia, the Claimants applied to the Head of the Central Jakarta District Court (“CJDC”) (“Head of CJDC”) for an 
order to enforce the Preliminary Award. The Claimants’ application was dismissed by the Head of CJDC, a decision which 
was upheld by the Supreme Court of Indonesia. On the advice of counsel, the Claimants filed for judicial review of the 
Supreme Court of Indonesia’s decision on 19 April 2011. The outcome of that application is still pending. The Claimants 
are of the opinion, following consultation with its counsel, that the decisions of the Head of CJDC and the Supreme Court 
of Indonesia are not based on strong legal considerations. However, the decision of the Supreme Court of Indonesia 
is final and binding, and the chance of a favourable outcome in the judicial review is slim. In any event, this being an 
enforcement action, an unfavourable outcome for the judicial review would not have direct monetary implications to the 
Claimants.
 In 
connection with the above, PTDV and PTAPM jointly filed a suit in June 2010 in the CJDC seeking to annul the 
Remaining Awards. PTDV also filed a separate suit seeking refusal of enforcement of the Remaining Awards. Both of these 
challenges were subsequently dismissed by the CJDC.

(iv)  P
TDV and PTAPM jointly appealed against the CJDC’s decision not to annul the Remaining Awards and this appeal 
is pending before the Supreme Court. PTDV also appealed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia against the CJDC’s 
decision to dismiss its application for refusal of enforcement of the Remaining Awards. On 28 June 2012, the Supreme 
Court of Indonesia dismissed PTDV’s appeal thereby upholding the CJDC’s decision to dismiss PTDV’s application for 
non-enforcement of the awards. With respect to the pending appeal before the Supreme Court, the Claimants are of 
the opinion, following consultation with its counsel, that the Supreme Court is likely to grant a decision in favour of 
the Claimants since the legal considerations made by the judges in the CJDC are strong, supported by facts and have 
sufficient legal grounds.
 I
n December 2011, the Claimants filed an application for enforcement of all the monetary awards in Indonesia. On 
11 September 2012, the CJDC rejected the Claimants’ application, which decision renders all the arbitration awards 
unenforceable in Indonesia. The Claimants filed an appeal on 25 October 2012, and the outcome of that appeal is still 
pending.
(v)
 In Singapor
e, leave to enforce the Awards was granted by the Singapore High Court in August and September 2010, and 
the Claimants entered judgment in terms of the Awards in March 2011.
 In J
uly 2011, the Claimants obtained a worldwide Mareva injunction to restrict PT FM from disposing of its assets and 
requiring PT FM to declare all its assets. PT FM failed in its application to set aside the Mareva injunction orders.
 In May 2011, P
T FM applied to challenge the Claimants’ right to enforce the Awards as Singapore court judgments. PT 
FM’s application to set aside the Singapore court judgments was allowed, and the Claimants filed an appeal against this 
decision.
 In Sept
ember 2011, PTFM applied to set aside the Singapore High Court orders granting leave to enforce the Awards 
(“PTFM’s Setting Aside Application”) and the hearing of such application took place over three days from 23 to 25 July 
2012.
 In a decision issued on 23 Oct
ober 2012, the High Court of Singapore dismissed PTFM’s Setting Aside Application and 
confirmed the enforceability of the Awards in Singapore. In the same decision, the court also dismissed the Claimants’ 
Appeal, finding that on the facts there had not been effective service on PTFM.
 Subsequently
, PTFM filed an appeal to the Singapore Court of Appeal against the dismissal of its Setting Aside Application 
by the Singapore High Court (“PTFM’s Appeal”). PTFM’s Appeal was heard by the Singapore Court of Appeal from 10 to 
12 April 2013. The Singapore Court of Appeal has reserved judgment and a decision is expected before September 2013. 
The Claimants continue to be of the view that they have reasonable prospects of success in resisting PTFM’s Appeal.

September 2010, and the Claimants entered judgment in terms of the Awards in December 2010.
 In J
uly 2011 the Claimants obtained a garnishee order nisi in respect of the money loaned by PTFM to its shareholder 
(namely AcrossAsia Limited) in Hong Kong (“Garnishee”), which would, when made into an absolute order, require the 
Garnishee to pay the Claimants the relevant sums in part satisfaction of the amounts outstanding from PTFM under the 
Awards.
 In J
anuary 2012, PTFM applied to set aside the Hong Kong orders of August and September 2010 and the December 
2010 judgment enforcing the Awards. PTFM and the Garnishee are also challenging the garnishee proceedings on the 
basis of jurisdiction. The hearing for the setting aside application in Hong Kong was stayed pending the determination of 
the Singapore setting aside application (see (v) above).
 P
ending the final determination of the Singapore setting aside application, on 21 March 2012, the Hong Kong High Court 
ordered the Garnishee to pay into court all sums due and payable to PTFM under the loan (“Payment-in Order”). The 
Garnishee appealed against the Payment-in Order, but its appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
 On 14 Sept
ember 2012, the Garnishee disclosed the existence of an Indonesian arbitration award ordering that the 
Garnishee repays the loan amount to PTFM. On 24 September 2012, the Garnishee filed its application to discharge the 
Payment-in Order and to discharge the garnishee order nisi (collectively, the “Discharge Applications”).
 T
he substantive garnishee proceedings and the Discharge Applications have been fixed to be heard from 9 to 13 
September 2013.
 In Dec
ember 2012, by reference to the Indonesian arbitration award, PTFM commenced proceedings against the 
Garnishee in Indonesia under bankruptcy laws.
 T
o preserve the proceedings above, in hearings held on 24 January, 4 and 6 February 2013 the Claimants applied for 
and obtained injunctions against the Garnishee and PT FM to restrain them, individually or jointly, until further order by 
the Hong Kong High Court, from taking steps in Indonesia or otherwise which have the effect of discharging (in whole or 
in part, including any set-off or compromise), disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of the garnisheed debt; 
and from taking further steps in the Indonesian proceedings before the Indonesian Courts except with the consent of the 
Hong Kong High Court. These injunctions were granted with the Claimants giving a qualified undertaking as to damages 
on 6 February 2013.
 As the P
ayment in Order was still outstanding on 4 February 2013, the Hong Kong High Court also ordered the Garnishee 
to pay in to Court the sum of u
SD46,774,403 by 18 February 2013. However, in light of the proceedings in Indonesia, 
the payment-in deadline was further extended until 7 March 2013.

 T

6 February 2013 was adjourned on 11 March 2013 for an indefinite period with liberty for the parties to restore and a 
directions hearing is to be fixed no later than 14 June 2013.
 In an announc
ement dated 5 March 2013 to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Garnishee disclosed that the Indonesian 
court had made an order of bankruptcy against it. By 7 March 2013 the Garnishee had not complied with the Payment-
in Order. In an announcement dated 11 March 2013, the Garnishee announced that they remain presently unable to 
comply with the Payment-in Order in view of the bankruptcy order issued against them in Indonesia on 5 March 2013 
and that they will be filing an appeal in Indonesia. The Garnishee has since filed its appeal. In response, PTFM submitted 
its representations opposing the Garnishee’s appeal. A decision on the appeal is now pending.
 Subsequent t
o the issuance of the bankruptcy order on 5 March 2013, the Claimants applied for injunctions in order to 
safeguard the Claimant’s interests in respect of the Payment-in Order. The Claimants’ application was however dismissed 
by the Hong Kong High Court, and the Payment-in Order remains outstanding.
 So f
ar as the substantive Hong Kong garnishee proceedings are concerned, the Claimants consider that there are good 
prospects for an order absolute being made, albeit there are steps taken by the Garnishee and PT FM as more particularly 
set out above to attempt to undermine that possibility.

 Civil Suit in Indonesia b

 On 14 No
vember 2012 MBNS received a letter from the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur enclosing a purported court 
summons with respect to a claim made by PTDV in the SJDC against AAAN and others as defendants. MBNS is named 
as Defendant II. The claim brought by PTDV is allegedly for an unlawful act or tort. The letter states that the Defendants 
are summoned to attend before the District Court of South Jakarta on 10 January 2013. There are no further details given 
in the said summons.
 T
he hearing on 10 January 2013 was adjourned to 10 April 2013 to allow for various legal formalities to be dealt with. On 
10 April 2013, the court being satisfied that all Defendants were properly summoned adjourned the matter for a further 
week to 17 April 2013 for parties to go through the mandated mediation process. On 24 April 2013, MBNS was officially 
served with the statement of claim and the mediation process was said to have been formally commenced.
 T
he suit is brought by PTDV for damages for an unlawful act (i.e. a tort) alleged to have been committed by AAAN, 
AOL, AAMN, Augustus Ralph Marshall, our Non-Independent Non-Executive Deputy Chairman, certain individuals as well 
as MBNS (collectively, “Defendants”), arising from a dispute that arose in 2008 over a proposed DTH pay-TV business

Defendants for, amongst others, immaterial loss of 
u
SD20 billion and interest.
 MBNS is of the opinion, f
ollowing counsels’ advice, that PTDV’s Claim against MBNS is not supported with valid grounds 
and the quantum of damages sought is unjustifiable. The Company wishes to further clarify that the PTDV’s Claim is in 
relation to and stems from an on-going dispute in relation to the Proposed Indonesian Joint Venture which has been the 
subject of past litigation and arbitration proceedings since 2008 (as disclosed in para (ii) to (vi) above).

43 S EGMENT  I NFORMATION
For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their services, and has two separate segments based 
on operating segments as follows:
i.
 T
he television segment is a provider of television services including television content, creation, aggregation and distribution;
ii.
 T
he radio segment is a provider of radio broadcasting services; and
iii.  T
he other non-reportable segments comprise operations related to magazine publication and distribution and multimedia 
interactive services
The corporate function relates to treasury and management services and is not an operating segment. The corporate function is 
presented as part of the reconciliation to the consolidation total.
Transactions between segments are carried out on mutually agreed basis. The effects of such inter-segment transactions are 
eliminated on consolidation. The measurement basis and classification are consistent with those adopted in the previous financial 
year.
Performance is measured based on segment profit, which is profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are 
reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker comprising the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance 
as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results. Income taxes are managed on a group 
basis and are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on mutually agreed basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
s
egment assets
The total of segment assets is measured based on all assets (including goodwill and excluding deferred tax asset) of a segment, as 
included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors.
Segment liabilities
The total of segment liabilities is measured based on all liabilities (excluding tax liabilities) of a segment, as included in the internal 
management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors.

46 T RANSITION  FR OM  FRS T O  MFRS
In preparing the first set of financial statements in accordance with MFRS, MFRS provides first-time adopters certain transition 
elections as specified under the MFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of MFRS” from full retrospective application in the opening MFRS 
financial statements at 1 February 2011 (transition date). The Group and the Company have complied with the following mandatory

(i)
 MFRS E
stimates
 MFRS 
estimates as at the transition date are consistent with the estimates as at the same date made in conformity with 
FRS.
(ii)
 Hedge A
ccounting
 Hedge 
accounting can only be applied prospectively from the transition date to a hedging relationship that qualifies 
for hedge accounting under MFRS 139 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ at that date. Hedging 
relationships cannot be designated retrospectively.
The Group and the Company have elected for the following optional exemptions:
(b)
 Optional e
xemption for business combinations
 MFRS 
1 provides the option to apply MFRS 3 “Business Combinations” prospectively for business combinations that occurred 
from the transition date or from a designated date prior to the transition date. This provides relief from full retrospective

prior to the transition date. The Group elected to apply MFRS 3 prospectively to business combinations that occurred after  
1 February 2011. Business combinations that occurred prior to 1 February 2011 have not been restated. In addition, the Group 
has also applied MFRS 127 “Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements” from the same date.

udited Financial Statements and the Reports of the Directors and Auditors thereon
 T
he Act requires that the Directors shall lay before the Company in general meeting the audited financial statements (comprising profit 
and loss account, balance sheet and the reports of the Directors and Auditors attached thereto). The audited financial statements and 
the Reports of the Directors and Auditors thereon will accordingly be laid before the Company at the First Annual General Meeting for

roposed Resolution 7 – Retention of Dato’ Mohamed Khadar Bin Merican as Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company 
pursuant to Recommendation 3.3 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2012
 Dat
o’ Mohamed Khadar Bin Merican, an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, has been an independent member of the 
Board of Directors of Astro All Asia Networks Limited (“ AAAN”) since 2003. AAAN is the former holding company which held the businesses of 
the Company prior to the establishment of the Company in March 2011. Taking into consideration the spirit and intent of Recommendation 
3.3 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2012, his appointment as an Independent Non-Executive Director would therefore be 
regarded as having exceeded a term of nine years.
 T
he Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee has assessed the independence of Dato’ Mohamed Khadar Bin Merican, and 
recommended that he continues to act as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company on the following basis:
(i)
 he c
ontinues to be able to exercise independent judgement and to act in the best interest of the Company;
(ii)
 he 
has detailed knowledge of the business and has proven commitment, experience and competency to effectively advise and oversee 
the management of the Company; and
(iii)
 he 
has met the criteria for independence as defined in Chapter 1 of the Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities.

the Company is in the best interests of the Company and recommends that you vote in favour of this resolution. For the purpose of clarity, 
in the event that shareholders’ approval for Resolution 7 is withheld and subject to the passing of Resolution 3, Dato’ Mohamed Khadar Bin 
Merican shall be re-designated as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company and the Board remains properly constituted 
as required under Paragraph 15.02 of the Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities.
