SCOPE AND BOUNDARY
This IAR extends beyond financial reporting and includes non-financial performance of AEON Credit. It specifies the material 
matters, opportunities, risks and outcomes attributable to or associated with the Group’s key stakeholders, which have a 
significant influence on its ability to create value. Unless otherwise indicated, this IAR covers the period from 1 March 2021 to

under review and the delivery of our initiatives towards our strategic goals. 
APPROACH TO MATERIALITY
We report based on our material matters, 
which are assessed yearly to ensure that the 
matters continued to be applicable and relevant.  
This ensures that our strategy, performance and 
prospects are illustrated in the correct context.  
Our response to material matters in the 
financial, economic, environmental, social and 
governance aspects of our business have also 
been considered. In developing this IAR further,  
we have included qualitative and quantitative 
performance measurements as well as other factors 
that may have affected business sustainability. 
A complete discussion of our sustainability 
performance can be found on page 60.

Sustainability Matters, please turn to page 40.

CONFERENCES AND ROADSHOWS
The CCO, CFO and IR team have participated in various 
conference calls in FYE2022 to brief investors on the 
Group’s strategic plan and to provide an update on the 
financial performance. Despite the loosening of pandemic 
lockdown restrictions, we remain committed in adhering 
to the standard operating procedures (“SOP”) of COVID-19 
and played our role in minimising physical engagement. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one-on-one and small 
group virtual meetings were conducted periodically to 
ensure a high level of investor engagement during the year.  
In FYE2022, we engaged with 286 participants including fund 
managers, bankers, researchers and analysts as compared 
to the previous year of 306 engagements. Moving forward,  
we intend to maintain our engagement activities with 
stakeholders while continuing to utilise the share register 
analysis to identify and earmark stakeholders who wish to 
participate.

Riding the New Wave
Dear Valued Stakeholders,
The prolonged pandemic phase 
was a good lesson on how we 
need to constantly be prepared 
to pivot when faced with the 
unexpected. The unprecedented 
challenges offered businesses an 
opportunity to reform strategies, 
expedite digital transformation 
and prioritise sustainability 
measures. AEON Credit Service 
(M) Berhad (“AEON Credit”) and 
its subsidiary (“the Group”) is 
riding this new wave of emerging 
opportunities in order to serve 
our customers better.
On behalf of the Board of 
Directors (“the Board”), I am 
honoured to have the opportunity 
to present AEON Credit’s 
Integrated Annual Report for the 
financial year ended 28 February 
2022 (“FYE2022”).

Our main priority 
is the continuous 
monitoring and 
vigilant assessment 
of inherent credit 
risks in our financing 
portfolios.
OUR FOCUS IN A CHALLENGING 
MARkET ENVIRONMENT
AEON Credit faced its fair share of 
challenges in FYE2022, given that 
the COVID-19 pandemic continued 
to leave its impact on markets and 
economies. In 2021, the Malaysian 
government reimplemented Movement 
Control Orders (“MCO”) which disrupted 
business operations nationwide. 
Rising inflationary pressure and the 
unexpected flash floods in several 
states in Malaysia during the year-end 
had posed further headwinds to the 
economic condition. 
The gradual reopening of the economy, 
easing of containment measures, and 
the increasing vaccination rate towards 
the end of the year was a silver lining. 
The Malaysian economy grew 3.1% in 
2021 from a contraction of 5.6% in the 
previous year as economic activities 
gradually resumed, together with a 
recovery in the labour market amid 
continued policy support.
Operating amid the COVID-19 
pandemic and working within what is 
fast becoming a new normal, the Group 
has demonstrated its resilience as an 
organisation that is agile and adaptive 
to secure long-term growth prospects 
as we coped against these uncertain 
times by fortifying our financial position 
while enhancing sustainability and 
digitalisation initiatives. 
Our main priority is the continuous 
monitoring and vigilant assessment of 
inherent credit risks in our financing 
portfolios, with proactive attention 
focused on enhancement of asset 
quality, coupled with prudent cost 
management and improvement on 
financial and operational efficiencies 
by leveraging on positive business 
fundamentals. 
Understanding that the MCO has 
been equally tough for our customers,  
we also proactively engaged with our 
customers to further understand their 
financial needs and provide them with 
AEON Financial Assistance Programmes 
and relief assistance through  
loan moratoriums and restructuring.

COMPLETION OF CORE SYSTEM 
MIGRATION 
Our core system migration project was 
successfully completed in FYE2022 
which makes us ready to embark on 
new digitalisation and transformation 
initiatives. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS IN FYE2022
The past two years have shown that 
financial performance is vulnerable to 
external forces. We have reshaped 
our portfolio with revisions in credit 
assessment criteria, improved cost 
efficiencies and enhanced technological 
infrastructure and capacity to improve 
on our productivity and also leverage 
on our branch resources and merchant 
network to serve target customers and 
extend our reach. 
The Group recorded a profit after  
tax (“PAT”) of RM365.42 million for 
FYE2022 compared to RM233.96 
million in the previous financial year. 
This was mainly attributable to the 
higher transaction and financing 
volume as well as the reduction 
in allowance for impairment 
loss on financing receivables of  
RM205.14 million as a result of improved 
collection performance. 
Further details of the Group’s financial 
performance are set out in the 
Management Discussion and Analysis 
section of this IAR. 
We implemented strategic plans to 
adapt to the economic uncertainties 
and potential changes in customers’ 
spending behaviour, while setting up a 
solid foundation to capitalise on growth 
opportunities. 
The pandemic has led to rapid 
technology advancement as industries 
scramble to survive in a new normal. At 
AEON Credit, we took the opportunity to 
strengthen our information technology 
capabilities and further digitalise our 
operations. Good progress was made 
as we completed several key initiatives 
such as enhancing the AEON Wallet 
offerings via integration with iAEON  
App and other business partners; 
implementing AI technology to  
advance consumer behavior analysis 
for targeted marketing and effective 
cross selling; and improving customer 
onboarding.
Having enhanced our core back-end 
system in FYE2022, we are now ready 
to explore new business possibilities 
and provide comprehensive retail 
finance solutions to customers as we 
move into the new financial year ending 
28 February 2023 (“FYE2023”).
THE YEAR’S HIGHLIGHTS 
Strongly committed in building AEON 
Credit’s business sustainability and its 
growth agenda, several key achievements 
were recorded in FYE2022.
COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF 
INSUREPRO SDN BHD
We completed the acquisition of  an  
insurance broking company, Insurepro 
Sdn Bhd at end September 2021.  
The acquisition is aligned with our 
strategy of diversification to build a 
resilient business model, and grow our 
ability to offer more comprehensive 
insurance services as a licenced 
broker. This will enable AEON Credit 
to ramp up its currently small insurance 
business and ultimately help the Group 
in expanding its income base.
As a licenced broker, the Group can 
distribute an expanded range of 
conventional and takaful insurance 
products and services, including life 
insurance by leveraging on the AEON 
Group retail network and ecosystem.
DIVIDEND
The Board has recommended the 
payment of a final single-tier dividend 
of 15.00 sen per ordinary share and 
a special single-tier dividend of 5.00 
sen per ordinary share in respect of 
FYE2022 to be paid on 21 July 2022, 
subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”). Together with the 
interim dividend of 28.50 sen,  total 
dividends for FYE2022 amounted 
to 48.50 sen, resulting in a dividend 
payout ratio of 33.9%.
HUMAN CAPITAL
The COVID-19 pandemic remained 
the dominant challenge and grew in 
terms of the number of people infected.  
We worked tirelessly to safeguard 
the physical and mental well-being 
of our employees while ensuring that 
customers’ needs were met. The Group 
has focused on protecting employees’ 
health and safety by providing a safe and 
conducive workplace with extensive 
safety infrastructure, quarantine 
leave, medical costs coverage and  
work-from-home options to employees 
with 100% laptop use being implemented 
to drive productivity. Split operations 
and job rotations are being practiced, 
meetings are held virtually, the  
Work-From-Home Policy was revised 
and the Group also enhanced its 
COVID-19 pandemic related Standard  
Operating Procedure (“SOPs”) .

(“AML/CTF”) monitoring system for  
on-going due diligence and at the 
same time, we continue to ensure 
integrity and safeguard against 
corruption by abiding to the established  
Anti-Bribery Management System 
Policy, Whistle-Blowing Policy and 
Entertainment and Gift Policy. 
The Board directs the Group in the 
conduct of its affairs and provides 
sound leadership to the Management. 
We have 10 Board members 
(including four female directors) with 
a diverse range of competencies 
and extensive corporate experience.  
The make-up of our Board reflects 
diversity of gender, nationality, age, 
skills and expertise. Independent 
Directors form the majority of the Board.
In April 2021,  the Securities Commission 
(“SC”) issued updates to the Malaysian  
Code on Corporate Governance 
(“MCCG”), introducing new and 
enhanced best practices and further 
guidance to strengthen the corporate 
governance culture of public listed 
companies. In line with the revised 
MCCG, AEON Credit has restructured 
its composition of Board Committees 
and revised the Board Charter in 2021. 
ECONOMIC OUTLOOk 
While we remain cautiously optimistic 
for the immediate future, we take note 
that the market environment for the 
year ahead remains volatile as we 
contend not just with the resurgence of 
new variants of COVID-19, but with the 
FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY 
In view of the heightened expectations 
among external stakeholders on 
AEON Credit’s sustainability agenda 
and its commitments, as well as the 
increased requirements in the areas of 
governance, target setting, tracking and 
disclosures, the Group has established a 
Management Sustainability Committee 
(“MSC”) in November 2021 comprising 
key members of Senior Management 
to assist the Board in overseeing 
the formulation, implementation and 
effective management of AEON Credit’s 
sustainability strategies.
The MSC is expected to drive the 
Group’s overall sustainability efforts and 
to achieve AEON Credit’s three-year 
goal to be a leading Environmental, 
Social and Governance (“ESG”)
corporation in Malaysia. 
On the Environmental front, a Mangrove 
Tree Planting Project was implemented 
on 22 January 2022, whereby 500 
mangrove saplings were planted in 
Kota Belud, Sabah, in collaboration with 
Kota Kinabalu Wetlands Society, a NGO 
based in Sabah. 
On the Social front, AEON Credit 
supported the Malaysian AEON 
Foundation’s ‘AEON Sayap Bagimu’, 
a sustainable initiative for the nation 
that aims to provide opportunities, 
encouragement and support to 
communities in need. 
REINFORCING GOOD 
GOVERNANCE 
Throughout the financial year, the 
Board remained committed to improve 
on our governance practices through 
better transparency, responsibility 
and accountability. From the onset of 
the pandemic, the Board conducted 
detailed discussions and maintained 
active oversight of the developing 
COVID-19 situation. We deliberated 
on measures and controls put in place 
including the financial assistance given 
to customers affected by the pandemic 
as well as its impact on the Group,  
its employees and business partners.
In further enhancing the Group’s 
Governance, AEON Credit has 
established the Anti-Money Laundering 
and Counter-Terrorism Financing 
impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
which will affect commodity and material 
prices, as well as supply chains. 
However, for now, the country has 
transited from a pandemic to an endemic 
phase on the back of high vaccination 
rates and the implementation of the 
National Recovery Plan (“NRP”), which 
bodes well for the recovering economy. 
Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) for 
2022 is expected to grow between 
5.3% to 6.3% on the normalisation 
of economic and social activities, 
and resumption of projects with high 
multiplier effects.
The domestic demand recovery is 
projected to continue, anchored 
by private consumption, following 
the gradual improvement in labour 
market conditions amid a relaxation 
of containment measures, improved 
consumer sentiments and optimism 
from the vaccine rollout as well as 
targeted policy support for vulnerable 
households. 
Progressively advancing our business 
strategies in digitalisation and insurance 
brokerage, AEON Credit is solidly 
focused on growing market share 
and taking advantage of emerging 
opportunities. The Board is fully 
supportive of the Group in this journey 
and will provide the required leadership 
and guidance from accumulated years 
of experience in the industry.
Our strategic approach ahead is aimed 
at building a sustainable income base 
with a diversified services portfolio 
for the Group and its stakeholders, 
underscored by efforts to elevate the 
brand value and sustainability initiatives, 
while gaining leadership on the digital 
fronts. 
We will prudently focus on reviewing 
the risk and credit control on financing 
applications to sustain healthy  
asset quality, while easing credit 
assessment criteria for certain  
products and customers to a  
pre-COVID-19 level. This approach is the 
key to strengthening our fundamentals 
to sustain, adapt and future-proof our 
business for the changing times ahead.
Our strategic approach ahead is aimed at building a sustainable income base with a diversified services portfolio for the Group and its stakeholders.

will be at the forefront of transcending 
the boundaries of technology, banking 
and humanity.
GOING FORWARD
The world seems ready to open up and 
we are learning to live with COVID-19. 
At the same time, geopolitics is casting 
some shadows and the macroeconomic 
policy pathways are uncertain. In such 
an environment, we have to continue 
to be watchful and nimble. We take 
heart that our business pipeline is 
robust. Looking further out, given 
that technological changes could 
fundamentally reshape the financial 
system, we must do what we can to be 
ahead of the curve. In short, while 2021 
was a good and progressive year, we 
will continue to re-position ourselves as 
the most preferred non-bank financial 
services provider of the future.
IN APPRECIATION
The Board and I would like to take 
this opportunity to thank Dato’  
Md Kamal bin Ismaun, Yuro Kisaka 
and Masaaki Mangetsu who retired 
on 23 June 2021, for their dedicated 
service. We wish them well in all 
future endeavours. In their stead,  
we welcome AEON Credit’s new 
Managing Director, Daisuke Maeda and 
fellow director, Mitsugu Tamai, who were 
appointed on 23 June 2021. They bring 
with them extensive experience within 
the global AEON Credit ecosystem 
which will be an asset for the next 
chapter of growth for the Group.
OUR STRATEGIES 
To stay competitive in the ever 
evolving market, we believe that the 
digitalisation of our business will be the 
key towards sustainable growth. On our 
digitalisation journey, AEON Credit’s 
goal is committed to enhance our 
digital platforms to keep up in today’s 
highly competitive environment. This 
transformation will allow us to connect 
with our customers directly, proactively 
offering personalised solutions, 
which will simplify and automate our 
operational processes and improve 
efficiency, in line with our vision to 
be a leading innovative retail fintech 
company in Malaysia.
Our aim is to enter an era of digitalisation 
with the introduction of several key 
products that will push AEON Credit  
into a new future of retail financing. 
In expanding our reach to untapped 
rural and semi-rural areas, we intend 
to leverage on AEON Group’s retail 
network and ecosystem to capture 
the increasing demand for insurance 
services, and in underserved markets 
by providing customised solutions that 
meet our customers’ habits, needs and 
lifestyles.
NEW MILESTONE
During the year under review, 
AEON Credit, together with its Joint 
Venture (“JV”) consortium parties, 
AEON Financial Service Co., Ltd. and 
MoneyLion Inc. (“MLI”) submitted a 
joint application for an Islamic Digital 
Bank (“IDB”) Licence to Bank Negara 
Malaysia (“BNM”). 
On 29 April 2022, we were notified by 
BNM that the Minister of Finance has 
approved the issue of an IDB licence 
to a company to be formed by the JV 
consortium parties. This puts us in 
readiness to be part of Malaysia’s journey 
in advancing its financial inclusion 
agenda as the licence will enable us 
to expand the scope of our offerings 
to reach a wider pool of customers. 
Anchored on our aspiration to better 
society, leveraging on AEON Group’s 
retail strength, and empowered by 
transformative technology expertise 
from our digital partner, MLI, we are 
committed to build a Digital Bank that 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to record my sincere appreciation to 
our shareholders, customers, business 
partners, as well as regulators and the 
media for their steadfast support and 
continued trust in us. 
Salutations too to our employees 
who have performed with passion, 
professionalism and dedication, 
particularly our frontliners who 
continued to tirelessly serve our 
customers throughout these 
extraordinary times. Our people are our 
future. With the guidance of a strong 
leadership team and aligned to our 
AEON culture, I believe we are in a  
good position to drive our strategies 
forward and deliver value to our 
stakeholders.
My appreciation also goes out to my 
fellow colleagues on the Board for their 
invaluable support and counsel. On a 
personal note, I am honoured to helm 
the Board and look forward to a new era 
of the Group realising its aspirations. 
With a sound strategy, an invigorated 
team and a strong resolve to ride a 
new wave of opportunities, I believe 
we are in a good position to resolutely 
drive progress and build value for our 
stakeholders.
Thank you.

Rising from pandemic challenges, a new business environment has emerged. AEON 
Credit Service (M) Berhad (“AEON Credit” or the “Group”) must now ride a new wave of 
digital transformation and innovation in order to thrive in an increasingly competitive 
environment. This year’s Management Discussion and Analysis covers the strategic and 
business reviews of the reporting year and shares the Group’s direction moving ahead.
FYE2022 MARkET ENVIRONMENT 
The year 2021 began with hope, given the extensive vaccination 
programmes that have resulted in the easing of containment measures. 
However, the situation was then clouded by uncertainty as new 
COVID-19 variants led to pandemic disruptions in the economic sector 
again. Towards the end of 2021, global economic growth showed signs 
of recovery supported by the re-opening of economic sectors though 
inflation in major economies remained high given that the supply chain 
disruptions that tempered demand recovery and unexpected flash 
floods in several states in Malaysia at the year-end had posed further 
headwinds to the economic condition.
Malaysia’s GDP expanded by 3.1% in 2021 (2020: -5.6%) driven by 
strong external demand and gradual improvement in domestic 
consumer and business sentiment following the easing of  
containment measures. The Government introduced four stimulus 
packages totalling RM225 billion, with a fiscal injection of  
RM25 billion, in a bid to continue assisting people and businesses  
to get through the financial difficulties posed by the extended MCO.  
A low-interest-rate environment and rapid technological development 
continued to prevail to support economic activity and accelerate 
contactless transactions. The lifting of restrictions after the third  
quarter, when nationwide vaccinations reached a significant 
number, has led to a recovery trend in personal consumption which  
forecast a hopeful turnaround for most businesses in 2022.
IMPACT ON OUR PERFORMANCE
The main business priorities for AEON Credit in FYE2022 were 
gaining digital readiness to accelerate our digital transformation and 
cost efficiency capabilities, while stabilising impairment losses on its 
financing receivables. 
With the COVID-19 pandemic heavily weighing on the economy,  
we were also concerned about assisting customers who faced 
repayment constraints since 2020, and thus intensified the 
implementation of various relief assistance packages towards this 
end. These relief assistance packages include loan moratoriums,  
debt refinancing and restructuring, AEON Financial Assistance 
Programme, and collaborations with Agensi Kaunseling & Pengurusan 
Kredit (“AKPK”) to service the needs of different customers with varying 
financial conditions, and ensure that they are able to overcome their 
financial difficulties.
The Group’s strong commitment to its customers’ welfare was further 
reflected in its participation in the offering of payment holidays to 
customers affected by the recent floods. As at end of February 2022, 
about RM1.09 million have been approved under the payment holiday 
programme, benefitting 341 customers.

loss on financing receivables by 
RM205.14 million to RM303.28 million 
(FYE2021: RM508.42 million), partially 
offset by higher operating expenses in 
line with higher T&F volume. 
The Group continues to pursue its 
cost optimisation strategy by focusing 
on cultivating discretionary spending, 
concentrating on developing its talent 
pool as well as building digital solutions 
to improve customer experience and 
operational efficiency. 
The Group recorded a profit before tax 
(“PBT”) of RM526.82 million in FYE2022, 
improved by 62.1% from RM324.91 
million reported in FYE2021.  This was 
contributed by higher transaction volume 
and improved collection performance. 
Under the Malaysia Finance Act 2021,  
AEON Credit has provided for  
RM33.33 million of prosperity tax 
(“Cukai Makmur”) in respect of the 
chargeable income of the Company 
in excess of RM100 million which is 
taxed at 33% during the financial year. 
As a result, profit after tax (“PAT”) came 
in at RM365.42 million, increased by 
56.2%. Earnings per share generated 
for FYE2022 improved to 139.17 sen 
(FYE2021: 87.67 sen).
On the business front, there was a  
pick-up arising from the opening up 
of the economy in stages under the 
NRP. The implementation of marketing 
campaigns and the gradual easing 
of credit assessment criteria back to  
pre-COVID levels had translated 
into higher number of applications 
and approvals. Increased footfall in 
shopping malls and the reopening of 
branches and merchant outlets had  
also lent support to the sales and 
receivables recovery.
However, our core focus in Motorcycle  
Financing and Auto Financing were 
affected by inventory shortages due  
to supply chain disruption and the  
year-end floods which ravaged  
the nation.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Amidst a challenging operating 
environment, the Group has recorded 
another profitable year for FYE2022. 
AEON Credit’s transaction and 
financing (“T&F”) volume for the 
FYE2022 registered an increase of 
12.8% to RM4.77 billion as compared 
to RM4.23 billion recorded in the 
previous financial year ended  
28 February 2021 (“FYE2021”). 
However, the Group’s revenue 
fell 2.4% year-on-year (“Y o Y”) to  
RM1.52 billion in FYE2022 from  
RM1.56 billion a year ago due to the 
lower interest income recorded from 
a lower average financing receivables 
base.  
The Group’s other income increased by 
24.8% to RM181.36 million for FYE2022 
(FYE2021: RM145.28 million) on the 
back of improved bad debt recoveries, 
commission income from sale of 
insurance products and interest/profit 
income from deposits with licenced 
financial institutions.
Operating expenses saw a 17.1% 
decrease Y o Y to RM848.53 million 
(FYE2021: RM1,024.16 million) which 
resulted in the lower ratio of total 
operating expenses against revenue 
for FYE2022 of 55.6% (FYE2021: 65.6%) 
arising mainly from lower impairment 
FINANCIAL POSITION
AEON Credit’s strategic focus in 
ensuring recovery and growth 
with the implementation of various 
counteractions against the impact of 
COVID-19 had served the Group well. 
Financial position remains healthy and 
strong with total equity increasing to 
RM2.20 billion as at 28 February 2022 
which translated to net assets per share 
of RM7.84 (2021: RM6.63).
The Group’s gross financing receivables 
contracted by 2.2% to RM9.86 billion 
as at 28 February 2022 compared to 
RM10.08 billion as at 28 February 2021. 
The decline was mainly due to the 
impact of business restrictions under 
various MCOs implemented in the 
past two years that resulted in many 
businesses facing various challenges 
besides the tightening of credit criteria 
to fortify its asset quality. 
Slight deterioration is noticeable 
in overall asset quality with higher  
Non-Performing Loans (“NPL”) ratio 
standing at 2.66% as at end FYE2022 
from 2.46% recorded in FYE2021. 
Net credit cost on average financing 
receivables of 1.47% was lower 
compared to 3.74% in FYE2021 reflecting 
the effectiveness of measures taken by 
the Group in maintaining a satisfactory

quality of receivables, including 
strengthening of credit policies and 
revision in credit assessment criteria 
for various customer segments.  
As the economy remained uncertain, 
the Group continues to be prudent 
in setting aside additional provisions 
against potential credit losses.  
Loan loss coverage ratio stood at 
289.0% for FYE2022 as compared to 
339.0% for FYE2021.
The Group’s capital adequacy ratio 
(“CAR”) has strengthened to 26.8% 
in FYE2022 from 24.0% in FYE2021, 
the strong capital position provides 
ample headroom for growth in the 
future. The Group recorded a Return 
on Equity (“ROE”) and Return on Assets 
(“ROA”) of 19.2% and 3.6% respectively.  
Debt-to-equity ratio improved from  
3.8 times to 3.1 times.
BUSINESS OPERATION REVIEW
EASY PAYMENT AND PERSONAL 
FINANCING BUSINESS
Easy Payment and Personal Financing 
schemes recorded RM3,125.99 million 
in financing volume, an increase of 
20.0% from RM2,604.50 million in 
FYE2021. The Group has revised its 
product strategy and tightened credit 
policies for all its product offerings in 
response to the imposition of MCO 
and market impediments which were 
gradually lifted with the reactivation of 
the economy in the second half of 2021.
MOTORCYCLE FINANCING AND 
AUTO FINANCING
Performance for Motorcycle Financing 
and Auto Financing were impacted by 
supply chain disruption and the closure 
of merchant operations during the year. 
Sales activities rebounded in the second 
half of the year following the market 
reopening, however the inventory 
supply chain was also impacted by the 
unexpected flood situation experienced 
at the year end.
Motorcycle Financing remained as one 
of the key portfolio in AEON Credit, 
representing about 34.8% of the Group’s 
total loan portfolio despite financing 
volume declining from RM1,408.78 
million to RM1,298.45 million. Auto 
Financing volume increased by 18.9% to 
RM486.70 million. 
Within an environment of heightened 
competition among auto vehicle 
financiers, AEON Credit continued to 
drive business volume and market 
share through a targeted sales 
strategy, improved turnaround time 
for hire purchase loan via electronic  
Know-Y our-Customer or e-KYC, 
marketing initiatives as well as 
strengthened merchant management.
PERSONAL FINANCING AND 
OBJECTIVE FINANCING 
Personal Financing volume grew 
by 77.8% to RM1,007.94 million 
while Objective Financing business  
volume increased by 51.9% to 
RM328.59 million as compared to 
FYE2021. Overall sales improved  
upon the gradual reopening of the 
economy in November 2021, driven by 
consumer marketing campaigns and 
sales booster incentive campaigns, 
coupled with better approval ratio 
and better branch staff productivity 
management.
The expansion of core businesses 
continues to be our main priority where 
the Group is focusing on products 
with better profitability by reviewing 
the market and industry potentials, 
customer segments and geographical 
inputs.
SETTLEMENT BUSINESS
In FYE2022, our card business recorded 
a decrease in new customer acquisition 
for credit card as well as merchant 
recruitment due to pandemic-related 
disruptions. Total credit card sales 
transaction volume and receivables 
declined by 1.4% to RM1,456.17 
million and 10.9% to RM722.01 million 
respectively. AEON Classic Card 
contributed the highest revenue among 
all card types due to its largest portfolio. 
Acquiring transactions recorded at 
RM1,644.33 million in FYE2022, an 8% 
increase from FYE2021. About 87.7% of 
the acquiring transactions were derived 
from AEON Group of Companies, which 
represented a 2.3% increase compared 
to the previous year despite the 
reduction in shopping footfall due to the 
spike in COVID-19 cases.
E-money business continued to  
perform well, with card base increasing 
by 10.4% to 2.20 million. AEON Member 
Plus (“AMP”) card and AEON Wallet 
transactions volume grew by 26.0% to 
RM186.45 million Y o Y. 
To improve the convenience of the 
payment app, the AEON Wallet features 
were enhanced to include application 
of AEON Member Plus Visa card and 
credit card via AEON Wallet, loyalty 
points redemption, monthly e-statement 
as well as enabling credit card payment 
function via the e-wallet.
Going forward, AEON Credit will 
continue to focus on driving the credit 
card base via marketing efforts to  
acquire new customers through  
cross-selling initiatives as well as 
retention of existing customers.  
Apart from the aggressive rollout 
of various marketing campaigns for  
credit cards, we have continued to 
strengthen the collaboration with 
AEON Group of Companies and also 
enhanced the card features to attract 
non-AEON customers.

OUR INITIATIVES IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR  
Positive progress was recorded on 
several strategic fronts, placing AEON 
Credit in a better position for growth in 
FYE2023 as we reached key milestones 
in digitalisation and the development of 
new revenue resources. 
DIGITALISATION 
Globally, growth within the digital 
economy has understandably 
accelerated as the COVID-19 pandemic 
gave birth to new digital businesses 
and forced traditional brick-and-mortar 
enterprises to pivot online. In Malaysia, 
the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint 
(“MyDIGITAL”) is now deemed a critical 
enabler in realising the Twelfth Malaysia 
Plan, 2021-2025 (“RMKe-12”). In facing 
the digital economy transformation,  
it is imperative for AEON Credit  
to take the necessary steps to adapt 
and address the changing business 
environment where speed and 
accessibility determines success.
To date, AEON Credit has achieved the 
digitalisation of application processes, 
and is able to leverage on the speed 
and accuracy of artificial intelligence 
(“AI”) to refine credit assessment which 
helps to reduce the ratio of delinquent 
receivables and offer pre-assessed 
loan amount to customers. Backend 
fortification works were ongoing 
to upgrade end-to-end digital 
onboarding processes from customer 
application to settlement.
During the financial year, we rolled out 
the e-KYC to improve the transaction 
processing turnaround time to five

by enhancing digital infrastructure 
and upgrading network capacity to 
increase work mobility.

In order to speed up our digitalisation 
efforts and further improve user

application process, without the need 
for face-to-face contact. We are happy 
to report that currently, all our Easy 
Payment products are using online 
submission via identity authentication, 
biometrics, and e-KYC. 
Moving forward into FYE2023, the 
Group is building an even more 
dynamic digital platform towards 
harnessing the possibilities of Super 
Apps. These include full digitalisation 
of onboarding process with e-mandate, 
digital signature, and e-storage for 
Personal Financing and Credit Cards.
As at 28 February 2022, we have a total 
of 2.20 million AMP cards in circulation 
(“CIC”) and 1.35 million AEON Wallet 
downloads. In order to leverage on new 
contact leads through the AEON Wallet, 
in the first quarter of 2022, we launched 
the AEON Wallet contact leads form 
with a new feature to enable online 
application of AEON Credit products 
such as personal financing and credit 
cards via AEON Wallet. Customers can 
choose to apply directly through our 
online application platform or via our 
branches. 
At present, AEON Wallet and AMP  
cards are enabled for settlement. 
Moving forward, we aim to centralise 
AEON Group’s products and services 
under one main customer platform. 
Several enhancement plans in the 
pipeline include Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) 
transfer, Auto Reload and a tiered

•	 Vendor	e-Invoice	system
In FYE2022, we completed the 
vendor e-Invoice system automation 
which allows businesses/vendors 
to submit their digitalised invoices 
to AEON Credit instead of manual 
invoice submission in order to 
improve the productivity of finance 
payment, cut down manual data entry 
and also reduce paper consumption. 
NEW INCOME SOURCE FOR 
FUTURE GROWTH
•	 Completion	 of	 acquisition	 of	
Insurepro Sdn Bhd (“Insurepro”)
In end September 2021, upon 
obtaining the approval from Bank 
Negara Malaysia (“BNM”), AEON 
Credit acquired 100% equity interest 
in Insurepro, making it a wholly-
owned subsidiary of AEON Credit 
Service (M) Berhad. As Insurepro is 
principally engaged in conventional 
and takaful insurance broking 
business, the acquisition will allow 
AEON Credit to further expand into 
the insurance market and capitalise 
on new opportunities by transforming 
it into an insurtech company. With 
the new insurtech availability in 
the market, Insurepro can offer 
expanded insurance and protection 
schemes direct to consumers (“DTC”) 
via online tools with more pricing and 
product options as an advantage of 
being a broker. Furthermore, we 
shall be able to provide a one-stop 
service to our customer base of 
more than three million mainly from 
the B40 group, as well as enhance 
our service offerings as compared  
to aggregators with stricter 
compliance to BNM guidelines. 
Similar with AEON Credit’s main 
strategy, Insurepro shall continue 
to serve the underserved customer 
segments with micro-insurance 
products, by offering affordable 
premium with simple insurance 
plans.
With the rising demand of insurance 
and growing popularity of the DTC 
approach, we are confident that 
this acquisition will multiply AEON 
Credit’s income from insurance,  
which currently makes up less than 
5% of our total income.
•	 Award	 of	 Islamic	 Digital	 Bank	
Licence from the Minister of Finance  
A new milestone in our journey 
to become a Digital Bank has 
been  achieved subsequent to the 
financial year. After submitting a joint 
application to BNM for a digital bank 
licence on 30 June 2021, the AEON 
consortium obtained approval from 
the Minister of Finance for an Islamic 
Digital Banking licence in Malaysia 
on 29 April 2022.
Comprising AEON Credit, its parent 
company AEON Financial Service Co., 
Ltd. (“AFS”), and technology partner 
MoneyLion Inc., the consortium has 
the combined expertise of all three 
companies in providing financial 
services and solutions to customers, 
especially from the underserved 
and unserved market segments 
with a new business model in the 
market, adding dynamism to the 
banking landscape and contributing 
to the financial inclusion agenda in 
Malaysia. 
We are confident that with our 
25-year track record operating 
in Malaysia, with over four million 
customers, an ecosystem of 64 
outlets, and multiple product 
offerings, we have the infrastructure 
and resources required to design 
hyper-personalised products and 
services to extend our customer 
reach.
HUMAN RESOURCE 
DEVELOPMENT
The transformations we are making 
on the digitalisation front have to be 
accompanied with the acquisition 
of the right talents and grooming of 
new capabilities within our people. 
In order to evolve as an innovative 
Fintech company, it is vital that we 
attract the right talents with a good 
work environment that nurtures high 
employee satisfaction.
Therefore, in FYE2022, we continued 
investing in our people by providing 
them with various virtual trainings 
despite the challenges during the 
pandemic. A total of 27,892 training 
hours (average 9.4 hours per employee) 
were invested on our employees in 
FYE2022.
We also spent RM1.61 million to 
energise our Management Team with a  
two-year external Coaching Programme 
(2021 and 2022) for Senior Management 
positions. 
In order to champion a fulfilling 
career development pathway,  
we conducted the annual Employee 
Promotion Assessment in December 
2021 and a total of 2,213 employees 
were given the opportunity to undertake 
the examination. This system promotes 
transparency and encourages our 
people to continue learning and 
achieve success in AEON Credit.
Last but not least, in evolving as an 
employer of choice, we launched 
our first Management Trainee 
programme in 2021 with the pioneer 
batch graduating at the end of 
FYE2022. Through this programme,  
we have successfully nurtured and 
retained five young talents and they 
will continue to grow their career path 
with AEON Credit after completing the 
two-year programme.
These efforts lay the foundation of our 
plans to nurture talents that will help 
us to achieve our progressive goal of 
becoming a well-regarded innovative 
Fintech company.

ENSURING SUSTAINABLE VALUE DELIVERY 
AEON Credit places great importance on 
environmental, social and governance 
(“ESG”) issues. We recognise that within 
a crowded marketplace, a company’s 
ESG commitment is increasingly a key 
factor in attracting and retaining a loyal 
customer base. In stepping up our ESG 
journey, AEON Credit has formalised 
commitments to strengthen sustainable 
business practices and integrate ESG 
principles into our daily operation.
This was initiated by successfully 
establishing a Management Sustainability 
Committee to drive the Sustainability 
agenda for the Group by overseeing all 
sustainability related matters including 
reviewing the overall sustainability 
plans, objectives and performance 
towards set key performance indicators 
to be achieved by FYE2026.
In moving ESG up the agenda for 
FYE2022, a growing focus on Climate 
Change is being explored. Towards this 
end, we intend to be guided by BNM’s 
guidance document named Climate 
Change and Principle-based Taxonomy 
(“CCPT”) for financial institutions to 
use to assess and classify economic 
activities that contribute to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation. 
The engagement with subject experts 
will enable the process of knowledge 
transfer. This allows AEON Credit to 
establish its ESG Framework and 3-year 
ESG Roadmap with set ESG KPI targets. 
Moving forward, we intend to continue 
committing to our ESG initiatives while 
delivering sustainable earnings to our 
shareholders.
interest yields. Digital reliability and 
customer centricity will drive our focus 
as more touchpoints move towards 
digital channels particularly in the end 
to end onboarding process, which is 
to be completed in this financial year.  
This will enable us to reach out to 
unserved markets and improve 
operation resiliency. 
Moving forward, enhanced risk 
management, continued cost discipline 
and expansion of core businesses  
will remain as our priorities to sustain 
growth.
ACkNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to convey my deepest 
gratitude to all AEON Credit employees 
for their unwavering support and hard 
work throughout this financial year. 
Despite the challenges, our employees 
managed to work together as a team 
towards the betterment of AEON Credit. 
The Group’s improved performance is 
a strong testament of our employees’ 
dedication and relentless efforts. 
My appreciation goes to the Board of 
Directors for their leadership, counsel 
and guidance, and to our Senior 
Management team for their hard work 
and dedication, without which the 
Group would not have achieved its 
positive momentum over the past year.
Gratitude should also go to our 
customers for their continued 
patronage and loyalty, our business 
partners and shareholders, as well as 
other stakeholders who have journeyed 
together with AEON Credit. 
Together, let us strive forward to 
overcome the challenges ahead and 
to scale new heights of growth and 
progress.

OUTLOOk AND PROSPECTS FOR FYE2023
Malaysia’s economic growth is 
anticipated to accelerate in 2022 
after navigating a bumpy and uneven 
recovery in 2021. High vaccination 
coverage and active vaccine booster 
shot rollout are expected to support 
consumer and business sentiment 
amid sizeable fiscal support and 
accommodative monetary policy. 
However, the geopolitical risk and 
ability of the vaccines to guard against 
any new COVID-19 variants remains a 
concern to the strength of the recovery. 
As the economy gradually recovers, 
AEON Credit expects the financial 
performance for FYE2023 to further 
improve, driven by topline growth 
which will be supported by positive 
asset growth momentum with sustained 
Enhanced risk management, continued cost discipline and expansion of core businesses will remain as our priorities to sustain growth.

OUR OPERATING LANDSCAPE
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
Global economic activities rebounded strongly to 5.5% in 2021, after a negative growth of 3.4%  
in 2020. This was due to relaxation of pandemic-related lockdowns in many countries which  
helped boost demand. 
However, resurgences of the COVID-19 infections due to new variants, and widespread supply 
bottlenecks weighed negatively on global activity in the second half of the year. There exists a 
disparity in recovery between the developed countries with successful vaccination programmes, 
and the emerging market and developing economies that recorded slower vaccination progress. 
Global growth is expected to decelerate markedly to 4.1% in 2022, mostly due to the impact of 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The incident has disrupted commodity supply, 
leading to higher commodity prices and inflation. On-going supply-chain bottlenecks, rising 
inflationary pressures, and elevated levels of financial vulnerability in large parts of the world 
increase the possibility of economic deceleration.

THE OPERATING LANDSCAPE IN MALAYSIA
Despite the global headwinds, the Malaysian economy is expected to progress steadily, underpinned 
by the continued expansion in external demand, full repeal of containment measures, reopening of 
international borders, and further improvement in labour market conditions. 
The Malaysian economy ended 2021 with the economy 
expanding to 3.4%, after the contraction of 5.6% in 
2020. Growth was below expectations due to the  
re-imposition of nationwide containment measures from 
June to September 2021. 
IMPACT: In 2021, AEON Credit navigated 
through unexpected challenges of flood 
impact and spike of COVID-19 cases 
due to the emergence of the highly 
transmissible Omicron variant. Outsourcing 
collections to external collection agencies 
was implemented as counter measure to 
manage lower staff productivity during this 
period.
As pandemic restrictions were eased from October 
2021 towards full upliftment in 2022, economic activities 
have started to pick up and labour market conditions 
are improving. Domestic GDP rebounded to 3.6% in Q4 
2021, a clear signal on economic recovery momentum. 
BNM forecasted a sustainable and resilient economic 
outlook with GDP growth projected to expand between 
5.3% to 6.3% in 2022, driven by continued external 
demand and improved domestic economic activity.
IMPACT: As economic conditions steadily 
strengthen, credit flow to the private sector 
is expected to pick up and subsequently 
lead to more demand for AEON Credit’s 
financing services. 
There is improvement in labour market conditions and a 
higher minimum wage was implemented on 1 May 2022. 
In addition to the one-off EPF withdrawal of RM10,000, 
these are expected to grow private consumption by 9% 
in 2022, from a low of 1.9% in 2021.  
IMPACT: These point to a recovery in 
disposable income and consumer spending 
as well as the subsequent revival of the 
retail sector. Stronger purchasing power 
and better loan repayment capabilities will 
improve our collection performance.
Manufacturing sector has been robust, surpassing 2019 
growth levels, as was Information & Communication, 
Finance & Insurance, and Utilities sub sectors. Tourism 
industry is projected to rebound strongly in 2022 with 
the reopening of interstate and international borders. 
There is also growth in wholesales and online retail 
trade with the wider surge of e-commerce and rapid 
transition to digitalisation.
IMPACT: With the relaxation of travel 
restrictions, tourist arrivals and domestic 
tourism are benefitting the services 
sector. Tourism and retail activities will 
boost AEON Credit’s credit card and easy 
payment sales.

MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS
The Group conducts an annual Materiality Assessment to identify Material Sustainability Matters, to ascertain if those identified 
last year still have continuing relevance and to take cognisance of matters that emerged in the current year that have gained 
significance. The review also considers matters that arose during our stakeholder engagements to ensure that the Material 
Sustainability Matters are balanced and incorporates feedback from our stakeholders.
The following process is adopted in conducting the Materiality Assessment:

Workshop held with the Managements to identify Material 
Sustainability Matters and, at the same time, create an 
understanding of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable

OUR STRATEGY AND LINK TO  
MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS
Towards achieving our ambition to be Malaysia’s No. 1 Innovative Retail Fintech Company 
with Largest App User Base, we have outlined a three-year roadmap. This addresses the 
current business challenges and our aspiration towards continued business sustainability.
In FYE2022, we have made significant progress in the first year of our strategy, despite the challenges associated with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Catalysed by five (“5”) priority focus areas, we sharpened our fundamentals to thrive in a post-pandemic 
financial landscape.  
Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing our performance to remain relevant in a competitive market. They enable us to 
enhance profitability through operating leverage and efficiency initiatives, while driving strong cash generation and resilient 
growth. These are leveraged on AEON Credit’s distinct strengths such as our strong retail networking, unique financial products, 
and services and digital capabilities.
Through the 5 fundamental priorities outlined in our strategy, we intend to continue maintaining our market leadership and 
enhancing our proposition to meet our customers’ needs.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
AEON Credit upholds good ESG principles in the conduct of 
our business. We consider sustainability as more than just a 
commitment, it is the central tenet upon which our business is 
predicated.
INTRODUCTION
This Sustainability Statement (“Statement”) 
serves to emphasise the prominent role 
of sustainability in our business and how 
it exerts an influence over our business 
strategies and operational plans. It highlights 
our sustainability commitments, presents 
reflections on our performance and 
achievements in executing sustainability 
initiatives over the period 1 March 2021 to  
28 February 2022. As well, the Statement 
also articulates our sustainability priorities 
moving forward. This Statement has been 
prepared with reference to Bursa securities’s 
Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”), 
specifically guidance from Bursa Securities’s 
Sustainability Reporting Guide 2nd Edition 
and Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) 
Standards 2021.
AEON Credit Service (M) Berhad (“AEON 
Credit” or “the Group”) upholds good ESG 
(“Environmental, Social and Governance” 
or collectively, “Sustainability”) principles in 
the conduct of our business. We consider 
sustainability as more than just a commitment, 
it is the central tenet upon which our business 
is predicated. Sustainability is infused in 
all aspects of our business, to translate our 
care for the environment and society at large 
as well as our responsibility for transparent 
operations into tangible actions. Reinforcing 
AEON Credit’s ESG credentials, in the year 
under review we improved our FTSE4Good 
rating from 2.1 to 3.6. We have also engaged 
with an external consultant to assist in 
enhancing our Sustainability Framework.
Across 2020 to 2022, we bear witness to 
the devastating effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Given the time lapse before full 
impact, the adverse effects that began to 
surface in the later part of 2020 have been 
more apparent and widespread in 2021. 
As we have done in the previous year,  
we continue to assist vulnerable  
communities through responsible financing 
and assistance to help these communities 
find their footing and help them rebuild their 
livelihoods.
The COVID-19 pandemic has driven home the significance of sustainability 
especially from the social perspective, “People” has always been integral to 
our basic principles, the full meaning of this term, which extends beyond our 
employees and includes society at large, was reinforced during the pandemic. 
In addition to implementing an extensive range of measures to secure the health 
and wellbeing of our employees, as a good corporate citizen AEON Credit 
also extended support to affected communities through food aid and financial 
support for the needy and underprivileged. 
Financial Inclusion and Responsible Financing as practiced by the Group 
includes participation in Agensi Kaunseling dan Pengurusan Kredit (“AKPK”) 
initiative, empathising with the customers’ financial concerns by offering our 
AEON Financial Assistance Programme (“AFAP”) and payment holidays as part 
of the Group’s commitment to help tide our customers through difficult times. 
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
Our fundamental goal is to generate long-term shareholder value while  
driving economic activity in a sustainable and responsible way. In this regard,  
we maintain a relentless focus on constantly achieving a delicate balance 
between economic performance and sustainability so that shareholders are 
rewarded a fair return on their investments while, at the same time, stakeholders’ 
interests are enhanced.
In upholding the above commitment, AEON Credit will:
•	 Play	an	integral	part	in	meeting	the	needs	of	the	local	community	for	
financial services through its business operations, adopting sound 
governance practices with a focus on customer experience and 
innovation.
•	 Become	more	employee-centric	by	taking	care	of	and	developing	
employees, including fostering a culture amongst employees to 
become better people and community members.
•	 Implement	environmental	 management	 initiatives	 to	 protect	 the	
environment and minimize impact on the environment from our 
operations.
•	 Share	benefits	 with	 the	 local	 community	 through	 activities	 which	
contribute to the society in line with our basic principles of pursuing 
peace, respecting humanity and contributing to local communities, 
always with the customer’s point of view as its core.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE 
Tone at the Top
At AEON Credit, sustainability starts at the highest 
level as an explicit indication of ownership and to lend 
credibility to sustainability actions. Setting the tone at 
the top promotes and expedites assimilation across 
all corners of the Group – this also epitomises how 
our business is governed and managed. The Group’s 
Leadership from the Board through to the Managing 
Director and the Top Management team all take active 
part in shaping and embodying our ESG agenda and 
orientation.
As a financial services provider, the governance 
aspects of sustainability have always been paramount 
in our operations, ensuring standards of prudence 
are complied with to safeguard interests of our 
stakeholders. Led by the Group’s Leadership, in 
particular the Board Risk Committee, we continue to 
raise the bar on sustainability to realise our duty of care 
for society, environment and the planet.
Sustainability Governance and Working Committee
At AEON Credit, Sustainability Governance is exercised 
through a well-thought-out structure that involves 
participation from the highest level through to business 
units. This structure facilitates the proper implementation 
of sustainability policies and imperatives, promulgated 
at the Leadership level  from tone at the top,  
by functional units charged with their execution. 
The Board recognises the importance of pursuing a 
business sustainability agenda and sets the tone to 
promote sustainability practices by balancing ESG 
aspects of the business in decision making. Supporting 
the Board is the Board Risk Committee (“BRC”),  
which also has purview over sustainability matters.  
The BRC is also responsible for reviewing sustainability 
policies and plans and to monitor the performance of 
their execution.
The Management (collectively comprising the 
Managing Director and the Top Management), 
through the Management Sustainability Committee, is 
responsible for driving the improvement and execution 
of the Group’s overall sustainability strategies and 
the associated initiatives. Management members 
individually and collectively play an active role to 
ensure that sustainability is part of AEON Credit’s 
business approach and is infused into the Group’s daily 
operations.
A Sustainability Working Committee (“STWC”) 
comprising key management personnel from business 
units supports our sustainability strategy development 
and executes sustainability initiatives. The STWC 
reports progress to and seeks guidance from the  
Top Management team or Board Risk Committee,  
as the case may be, when required. The STWC 
also plays an important role in raising sustainability 
awareness and embedding sustainability practices 
across the Group’s operations.

(a) Data Security, IT Infrastructure & Digital Transformation
(i) Business Continuity Management and Cyber 
Security 
AEON Credit places great importance on ensuring the 
continuity of all critical business functions and essential 
services. In this regard, we have put in place policies, 
processes and systems under the Business Continuity 
Plan (“BCP”), Disaster Recovery Plan (“DRP”) and Cyber 
Incidents Response Plan (“CIRP”) to respond to a range 
of unexpected disruptions and ensure continuous 
uninterrupted conduct of business and provision 
of services to our customers. A dedicated back-up 
site with all requisite infrastructure and services for  
back-up operations under the BCP has been 
established by the Group. Full BCP testing is executed 
annually during which all critical systems are tested to 
ensure they are accessible to conduct live transactions.
In light of COVID-19, AEON Credit has expanded BCP 
scenarios to enable employees in less critical and 
oversight functions to work from home, with laptop 
computers configured to internal standards and virtual 
private network (“VPN”) technology for secure access. 
As at end of FYE2022, these facilities were deployed 
to 100% of our workforce. 
Crisis Management Team (“CMT”) was activated to 
manage and appropriately respond to crises. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the CMT coordinated our 
strategic and operational responses to ensure smooth 
business continuity, keep employees safe and ensure 
clear and timely communications to all stakeholders. 
CMT meetings were held on a monthly basis and 
increased in frequency as the situation dictated.  
Moving forward, as the country moves into the 
endemic phase, CMT meetings will be held as and 
when necessary.
An enduring effect of the pandemic is the increased 
adoption of online transacting. The deepened ubiquity 
of electronic channels has become a distinctive 
characteristic of the new normal and is aligned to our 
Digital Transformation strategy. The increased use of 
online and digital platforms for service delivery and 
communications makes it imperative on AEON Credit 
to ensure security around online transactions. 
The growing sophistication of cyber threats has 
brought a need for greater vigilance and capabilities 
to address emerging threats to ensure continuous 
availability of services and adequate protection of 
customer and company data. In this regard, we have 
established a 24/7 IT Security Operation Centre  
(“SOC”) to monitor cyber related attacks on real time 
basis for immediate responses. Stringent security 
measures are implemented on all personal computers 
and IT Security tools such as Data Loss Prevention 
(“DLP”), File Integrity Management (“FIM”) and Intrusion 
Prevention System (“IPS”) have been deployed to 
safeguard and protect against any cyber-attack.
To evaluate the effectiveness of security measures 
and cyber threat mitigation plans, the Group 
conducts Cyber Crisis Simulation exercises to test our 
readiness to respond to cyber-attack scenarios that 
are most likely to impact the Group. The FYE2022 
AEON Cyber Security simulation tested a scenario 
described as “AEON Web Production Server has been 
Compromised”, which involved relevant business 
units formulating and presenting their action plans to 
mitigate the cyber risk and recover the website.
(ii) Customer Data Protection
AEON Credit has a large customer base and 
accordingly is custodian to a significant body of 
customers’ personal and transactional data. It is 
imperative to secure the confidentiality and privacy 
of these data and to protect or prevent exposure to 
intrusions, theft and misuse.
Confidentiality, privacy, integrity and availability 
of critical information are fundamental principles 
enshrined in the Group’s Integrated Management 
System (“IMS”) Policy. The Personal Data Protection 
Act 2010 (“PDPA”) and secrecy provisions under the 
Financial Services Act 2013 govern our customer 
data management policies. The Group has obtained 
certification under the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information 
Security Management System (“ISMS”) standard,  
thus providing assurance to both internal and external 
stakeholders of the Group’s information security 
management and risk mitigations.
Training and awareness programmes are regularly 
conducted to enhance employees’ understanding 
of the policies and processes in place to manage 
the handling and storage of customer and business 
information at every stage of the information lifecycle, 
as well as the processes for reporting security breaches.
CONDUCT AND TRUST
1
We place great importance on carrying out business in a responsible and ethical manner in compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations and ensuring that staff of all ranks conduct themselves ethically, professionally and with integrity. This has a 
significant bearing on our reputation in the market and how we are perceived by our stakeholders. Hence, it is imperative that 
our conduct reflects impeccable corporate governance. Our material sustainability matters under the Conduct and Trust pillar are:
OUR COMMITMENT TO 
GOOD CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
63


---- Page 66 ----
(b) Excellent Ethics, Governance, Risk & Compliance
(i) AEON Code of Conduct
The AEON Code of Conduct (“CoC”) dictates AEON 
Credit’s stringent standards on how we conduct 
business and is mandated on all the Group’s 
employees. It documents the Group’s underlying 
principles of good governance, integrity and ethical 
and responsible business conduct that should be 
followed at all times to earn stakeholders’ confidence 
and uphold our reputation as a good corporate citizen 
of impeccable standing. As well, the CoC epitomises 
AEON Credit’s corporate philosophy and approach 
to business in conducting operations with integrity 
and fair dealings with all stakeholders. The CoC is 
an integral part of newly on-boarded employees’ 
induction training and orientation programmes which 
is thereafter reinforced through annual CoC refresher 
training sessions aimed at continually embedding 
principles of good governance, ethics and integrity.
(ii) Anti-Bribery Management System 
Since March 2020, the Group has in place an  
Anti-Bribery Management System (“ABMS”) which 
is compliant with ISO 37001:2016. This system 
reinforces our basic integrity principle and  
embeds an anti-bribery culture within the Group. 
The implementation also facilitates compliance to 
adequate procedures requirement under Section 
17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission  
(“MACC”) Act 2009, which contains a corporate  
liability provision for bribery and corruption. 
AEON Credit’s implementation of the ABMS motivates 
employees to carry out their duties conscientiously 
and mitigates risk of corrupt activities or actions.  
We conduct an Anti-Bribery Risk Assessment annually 
to identify risks and assess adequacy of controls 
in place, with the aim of strengthening existing  
Group policies and procedures. For FYE2022,  
the Anti-Bribery Risk Assessment was conducted in  
August 2021. The result is similar to the FYE2021 
assessment where the rating of 13 key processes 
assessed was maintained as “Satisfactory” signifying 
the adequacy of controls governing the key processes.
AEON Credit’s Anti-Bribery Policy, approved by the 
Board and communicated to all employees, business 
associates and stakeholders, is available on the 
Company’s website under Corporate Policies section at  
https://www.aeoncredit.com.my/aeon-corporate/
corporate-policies/anti-bribery-policy or scan the QR 
code below:
Training sessions accompanied Anti-Bribery 
communications to heighten anti-bribery awareness. 
In FYE2022, the following Anti-Bribery initiatives were 
instituted:
Total number of employees 
attended Anti-Bribery Training
2,954
Management
10.1%
Non-Management
89.9%
•	 2,954	staff	 submitted	 their	 “Say	 NO	 to	 Bribery”	
e-Pledge 
•	 384	business	 associates	 submitted	 integrity	
declaration
During FYE2022, there was no reported case of 
corrupt act by any employee of AEON Credit and no 
political contributions were made directly or indirectly 
by the Group.
(iii) Compliance
Operating in an industry that is strategic to the 
national economy and exerting an influence over 
the confidence in the country’s financial system, 
AEON Credit is subject to stringent regulations and 
compliance requirements. The BRC has a dedicated 
focus on risk and compliance and plays a key role 
to support the Board in the oversight of compliance 
and risk management functions. 
The Board has approved a Compliance Framework 
which governs the processes that drive compliance 
across operations. Group-wide training and awareness 
activities were conducted to reinforce accountability 
and ownership of compliance processes across 
business units.
AEON Credit’s business, operations, products 
and services are governed by various regulatory 
authorities, including amongst others, Bank Negara 
Malaysia (“BNM”), Busrsa Malaysia and Kementerian 
Perdagangan Dalam Negeri & Hal Ehwal Pengguna.
Maintaining our FYE2021 performance, in FYE2022 
there were no instance of non-compliance to any law, 
policy or regulatory guideline issued by AEON Credit’s 
oversight authorities.

---- Page 67 ----
The Corporate Governance and Risk Management Department works in tandem with business units in monitoring and 
managing compliance risks through conducting periodic reviews of related policies and internal controls. Compliance 
activities conducted in FYE2022 are summarised below: 
(iv) Whistle Blowing Channels
In line with good practices for corporate safeguards 
against wrongdoing or risky or unethical behaviour, 
AEON Credit has long instituted a whistle blowing 
channel under the Group’s Code of Conduct, known as 
the AEON Hotline. Using this hotline, employees can 
draw attention to genuine concerns on any illegal or 
unethical practice, financial fraud, irregularity or breach 
of regulations, anonymously or otherwise and without 
fear of reprisals.
If any business partner, customer, other stakeholder 
or member of the public has knowledge of any 
irregularity or improper conduct, reporting via 
email can be made to the Senior Independent  
Director at eSID@aeoncredit.com.my . Thereafter, 
investigations shall be carried out in a confidential 
manner and further action will be taken, where 
necessary.
In FYE2021, the Group established an additional 
whistle blowing channel called Legal Attorney  
Hotline. This whistle blowing channel acts as a  
platform for all employees including business partners 
to report any misconduct (including violations of  
laws and internal policies) by the Top Management 
(Senior General Manager and above) direct to  
AEON Group Japan. The report shall be addressed to 
report_aeonglobal@yglpc.com. 
In FYE2022 there were 11 reports received on our 
whistle-blowing channels that were investigated and 
brought up to proper closure.
(c) Business Innovation, Responsible Marketing, Product & 
Service Design
(i) Responsible Financing/Financial Inclusion
Innovation is crucial to AEON Credit’s continuing 
competitiveness. We relentlessly focus on developing 
new and enhanced products and services to meet 
our customers’ evolving demands. In all cases, 
the development and marketing of our products 
and services is tempered with a strong sense of 
responsibility. 
AEON Credit remains committed towards providing 
suitable, affordable and quality financial services to 
targeted customer segments. The Group promotes 
inclusive finance where all segments of society, 
including the lower income, have convenient access to 
suitable and affordable financial services in contributing 
towards equitable and sustainable growth.
AEON Credit has always been ahead of its time in 
serving certain segments of the underserved market, 
for example new-to-workforce or new-to-credit 
segments. We are furthering our financial inclusion 
efforts through the following initiatives:
•	 We	have	expanded	our	offerings	to	include	payment	
services in the form of AEON Member Plus prepaid 
Visa card.
•	 We	leverage	 our	 payment	 channels	 such	 as	
AEONPay and payment via merchant to widen our 
reach and to better serve customers including the 
underserved segment. 
•	 Provision	of	financial	assistance	to	B40	customers	
during the pandemic and the recent December 2021 
floods.

In FYE2023, efforts on financial inclusion will continue to be focused on event-triggered activities to provide targeted 
financial assistance and aid.
Clear and concise product information is provided to customers to ensure important information and risk disclosures are 
highlighted. Employees are equipped with sound knowledge on product features and ethics to promote the products 
based on customer needs.
In FYE2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to constrain economic activities, exerting adverse impacts on income 
generation capacity of many within the working population. AEON Credit empathise with the difficulties and hardships 
faced by our customers and have responded by offering AFAP and payment holidays to support affected customers, 
especially those in the B40 segment. 
The Group also engages with affected customers to discuss and where appropriate propose “debt restructuring” or 
“rescheduling” programmes in order to facilitate their monthly repayment commitments. In this regard, customers also 
have access to AKPK for advice on managing their obligations.
With the introduction and widespread take-up of COVID-19 vaccinations towards the second half of 2021 and the 
administration of booster shots in 2022, the country is looking forward to a gradual recovery in economic activities back 
to pre-pandemic levels. This augurs well for AEON Credit and our customers, nevertheless we continue to be vigilant and 
stand ready to support our customers to tide through lingering challenges.
(d)
 Proportion of T
otal Payment to Suppliers and Vendors
AEON Credit practices and enforces transparency in our procurement process to ensure equitable treatment of payment 
to suppliers and vendors. We manage our procurement professionally and ethically in a manner consistent with best 
practices. Procurement of goods/services amounting to RM200,000 and above must be reviewed and approved by our 
Tender & Procurement Committee to ensure transparency and fair evaluation in the vendor and supplier selection process.  
Additionally, all confidential information both internal and external related to the procurement must be strictly protected and 
only used for the purpose for which it was provided.
AEON Credit has a commitment to source and procure from local vendors and suppliers to support their continued 
development and contribute to national economic recovery following the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In FYE2022, payment to foreign procurement suppliers and vendors declined to 7% of total payment compared to  
11% in the previous year in spite of an 18% increase in total payment.

excellence is also a significant differentiator in our intensely competitive industry. Our material sustainability matters under 
Customer Experience pillar are:
(a) Excellent Customer Experience, Support & Access
(i) Service Convenience and Customer Feedback
AEON Credit places strong emphasis on a two-way 
relationship with customers and values customer 
feedback on our products and services. Such feedback 
is valuable in our efforts to continuously improve and 
stay relevant, translating into enhanced service quality 
and greater customer satisfaction. The Group has in 
place a variety of touchpoints to facilitate customer 
contact.

An upcoming project for FYE2023 is the Introduction  
of Net Promoter Score by way of a Customer 
Satisfaction Survey conducted to measure overall 
customer satisfaction of our services based on 
identified customer service touchpoints.
We conduct mandatory training on customer 
management and customer service to all new recruits 
in frontline roles who interact with customers and 
business partners. In addition, soft skills training is 
routinely conducted for existing employees and 
new hires. In FYE2022, 41 soft skill training sessions 
were conducted for front liners, namely Branches,  
Contact Centre and the Credit Management team.  
In terms of planned training for FYE2023, an 
upcoming Complaint Handling Management Training 
for supervisors and team leaders is targeted for 3rd 
quarter 2022. This training is intended to enable 
staff in managing and handling customer feedback/
complaints professionally and solving customer issues 
to achieve win-win situations by providing suitable 
alternatives and appropriate justification to customers.
(b) Business Innovation, Responsible Marketing, Product & 
Service Design
Given that competition in the financial services industry is 
intensifying with customers growing more sophisticated 
and demanding, it is imperative that AEON Credit 
relentlessly pursue excellence in our product and service 
offerings to continue acquiring new customers and 
originate new business while retaining our existing valued 
customers. To this end, business innovation is fundamental 
in meeting the exacting demands of our customers. 
A tangible manifestation of our drive to continuously 
innovate is our Digital Transformation Programme which 
is consistent with the financial services industry’s move 
towards digitalisation. We have adopted digitalisation in 
our continuing efforts to enhance our product offerings 
to offer greater convenience, ease of access and greater 
benefits to our customers. This is articulated in greater 
detail below under our Digital Product and Service 
Transformation sustainability pillar. 
As we innovate in our product and service offerings, 
responsible features, terms and conditions remain  
top-of-mind to ensure that dealings with our customers are 
fair and equitable. 
The experience we give to our customers hinges 
significantly on the integrity with which our products 
and services are marketed and the care that goes into 
their design. AEON Credit take great pains in designing  
fit-for-purpose products and services that meet with the 
requirements of our customers. 
We adopt a responsible and transparent approach to 
marketing our products and services and provide our 
customers with full information on the associated terms 
and conditions to support them in reaching an informed 
decision when signing-up for our products and services. 
Collectively, our efforts have the overarching intent of 
ensuring fair treatment to our customers and leave them 
with a favourable impression which, in turn, will encourage 
loyalty and referrals.
This material matter is also applicable to our Conduct and 
Trust sustainability pillar and is articulated in greater detail 
therein.

DIGITAL PRODUCT AND SERVICE TRANSFORMATION
3
(a) Business Innovation, Responsible Marketing, Product & 
Service Design
In tandem with our continuing digital transformation, AEON 
Credit is placing increased prominence on building and 
strengthening our digital team through improvement in 
digital skills, access to tools and digital technologies. 
Alongside digitalisation, the Group has also placed intense 
focus on continually strengthening our cyber security 
stance to safeguard the security and integrity of our 
systems and protect data from cyber risks.
AEON Credit’s digital transformation journey continues 
in FYE2022 with the implementation of the following 
initiatives:
•	 MyAEON2GO	platform	 integration	 to	 provide	 AEON	
Member Plus (“AMP”) cardholders access to benefits 
under AEON Group’s e-commerce platform. 
•	 Building	on	e-KYC	capabilities	for	Credit	Card	and	AMP	
Visa Card for online application submission. 
•	 Implementation	of	 Instant	 Card	 issuance	 kiosk	 to	 
expand our recruitment channels and, at the same time, 
reduce physical interaction with recruiters. 
•	 AEON	Wallet	initiatives	covering:
- Introduction of loan functionalities to allow viewing of 
loan accounts and facilitating cards and loan account 
repayments via AEON Wallet;
- Introduction of AEON Wallet app into Huawei App 
Gallery riding on the Huawei Harmony operating 
system; and
- AEON Member Card termination via AEON Wallet.
Digitalisation initiatives planned for FYE2023 include:
•	 Peer-to-Peer	transfer	-	a	facility	targeted	at	AMP	Visa	
card users with AEON Wallet to allow fund transfers 
between AMP card users. 
•	 Unique	referral	code	–	a	functionality	to	allow	AEON	
Credit to tap on our existing user base to market the 
AEON Wallet mobile application. 
•	 Virtual	Express	Card	via	AEON	Wallet	which	enhances	
ease and convenience for AEON Express Card holders 
through the provision of a digitalised card.
Over the past decade, the combination of technology innovations and shift in consumer preferences has had a transformative 
impact across all industries globally, including financial services. IT innovations of the recent past have matured and become 
more economically feasible for implementation paving the way for digitalisation. Our material sustainability matters under Digital 
Product and Service Transformation pillar are:
As always, in developing and designing new and 
enhanced products and services, the requisite due 
diligence is exercised to ensure that they reflect AEON 
Credit’s responsibility for excellent ethics, fair dealings 
and sustainability both on the part of AEON Credit and our 
customers.
(b) Excellent Customer Experience, Support and Access
The role IT plays in the conduct of business and in everyday 
life from ordering food and daily necessities through to  
education has become even more deeply embedded 
following the COVID-19 pandemic. AEON Credit 
recognises the pervasiveness of IT and through our 
Digital Transformation is embedding broader and deeper 
application of IT into our products and services giving 
credence to the wave of change through digitalisation. The 
new normal has only heightened the impetus to hasten 
and deepen digitalisation. The initiatives we have taken 
in this regard are articulated in greater detail along with 
related planned initiatives moving into FYE2023 under the 
Customer Experience sustainability pillar above.

(a) Employee Health, Safety & Well-being
(i) Occupational Safety and Health 
AEON Credit’s Occupational Safety and Health 
(“OSH”) Policy reaffirms our commitment to provide 
a safe and conducive working environment for all 
employees and safeguard customers and visitors from 
potential hazards caused by the Group’s business 
activities. This OSH policy was updated on 9th 
December 2021 to reflect the formal establishment 
of the Safety and Health Committee at Place of 
Work which comprise representatives from different 
functions, roles and locations across the organisation.  
The Group’s Emergency Response, Safety and Health 
and Housekeeping Guidelines (“ERSH”) Committee is 
chaired by the Managing Director which has, as their 
principal responsibility, the formulation and review 
of the Group’s OSH Policy with reference to the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994.
Detailed guidelines on hazard identification and risk 
assessment are outlined for implementation in the  
ERSH document. The Group also endeavours to  
provide a safe and conducive working environment 
for all its employees and non-employees alike. 
Regular audits by both internal and external auditors 
are performed for incident investigation, hazard 
identification and risks assessment relating to incidents, 
to determine corrective actions and improvements 
needed in the OSH Management System.
In FYE2022, there was a total of 43 personnel  
(2021: 330) or 1% (2021: 9.3%) of our total workforce 
who are not employees of AEON Credit but whose 
work and/or workplace were controlled by AEON 
Credit. These personnel include vendors, agency 
workers, contractors, volunteers, individuals and 
self-employed persons. All such personnel and all 
permanent employees are covered under the Group’s 
OSH Management System, this is similar to FYE2021.
The Group conducts occupational health and safety 
training for our employees, including generic training, 
training on specific work-related hazards, hazardous 
activities and hazardous situations. Office Emergency 
and Safety briefings are also mandatory for new 
joiners, which are run concurrently with their induction 
program. All appointed Fire Marshals are given training 
on Essential First Aid and Fire Marshal Refresher 
Course on a periodic basis. 
EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY & WELL-BEING
4
Equality as well as diversity and inclusion underpin our Human Resources policies. Further, AEON Credit recognises the strategic 
importance of maintaining safety at workplace and having a healthy workforce as an intrinsic part of our responsibility to our 
people who form the backbone of the Group. Our material sustainability matters under Employee Health, Safety and Well-being 
pillar are:
(ii) COVID-19 Preventive Measures
AEON Credit complies with the Ministry of Health 
(“MOH”) and National Security Council (“NSC”) 
pandemic guidelines and Standard Operating 
Procedures (“SOP”) and instituted Frequently Asked 
Questions (“FAQ”) to guide our employees and 
operationalise the SOP. 
Employees are allowed to work from home if their 
job functions permit. Strict compliance to SOP is 
enforced when employees are required to work from 
the office. As a provider of essential services, the 
Group instituted split operations for critical business 
units through relocation of employees as a counter 
measure to reduce risk exposure amongst them. 
In FYE2021, the Group established AEON Credit’s 
Employee Support Programme, a dedicated platform 
to attend to employee queries and grievances related 
to COVID-19 pandemic, this programme continued 
into FYE2022 and has served as a useful avenue to 
update employees on our COVID-19 responses and 
convey the Group’s expectations of employees in our 
collective effort to fend off adverse effects on health 
and keep our business operating while maintaining 
service levels.

(i) Workforce Diversity 
AEON Credit celebrates diversity and inclusiveness in 
our workforce, our approach to diversity is anchored 
on respect, equality and inclusion. In line with the 
AEON Credit’s CoC, the Group respects the rights of 
every individual and fosters diversity and inclusivity 
with the aim of building a harmonious, dynamic and 
strong workforce 
The Group recognises that diverse talent is necessary 
to innovate and compete in a rapidly changing 
business landscape. By promoting inclusivity and 
equality in the workplace, employees will be happier 
and more comfortable in their work environment. 
Thus, creating a diverse work force can contribute to 
increased retention, motivation and productivity as 
well as contribute to responsiveness of AEON Credit 
to an increasingly diverse customer base and expand 
the creativity of the organisation overall. 
The Group has a gender ratio of 35.08% male : 64.92% 
female at the end of FYE2022 (FYE2021: 35.08% :  
65.92%). The gender composition at the senior 
management level has remained relatively stable, 
FYE2022 77% male : 23% female compared against  
76% male : 24% female in FYE2021. Nevertheless,  
AEON Credit remains steadfast in recognising the 
importance of women in leadership positions and 
strives to assure a fair female representation at the 
management level.

(iv) Employee Engagement
The Group recognises the importance of  
communication at the workplace and constantly 
provide two-way communication channels for 
employees to create a positive work environment. 
Constant engagement creates a strong emotional 
connection between the Group and our employees 
which promotes higher productivity, contribution and 
serves as a motivational force for others.
AEON Credit places great significance to ensure 
our employees are continually engaged. It is an 
acknowledged fact that a good employee experience 
goes a long way towards attracting and retaining 
top talent, to this end we have in place a spectrum 
of mechanisms across the employment lifecycle to 
deliver an enriching and rewarding experience to 
keep our employees engaged and passionate about 
being part of AEON Credit which in turn, drives long 
term sustainable growth. In compliance to restrictions 
imposed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and 
out of a duty of care to ensure the good health of 
our employees, AEON Credit encourages usage of 
virtual platforms for discussions and meetings which 
have been the predominant interaction mechanism in 
FYE2022. 
Our employee engagement channels are summarised

Employee Suggestion 
Programme
Quarterly
The Employee Suggestion Programme (“ESP”) was 
established to encourage employees to contribute 
constructive ideas for operational improvements. 
Inputs provided by employees are reviewed by the 
ESP Committee before implementation. The ESP, 
which has been extended following favourable 
reception during its launch in October 2011, covers 
a 1 year period with quarterly submission windows. 
The ESP Committee selects 3 best suggestions every 
quarter which are recognised by the award of a 
token of appreciation along with a certificate from the  
Managing Director. At the end of the 1 year ESP period 
the best 10 suggestions are shared with heads of 
business units for consideration and implementation.  
In FYE2022, 109 suggestions were received 
which underwent review and assessment by the 
ESP Committee comprising the CFO and Senior 
Management and representatives from Customer 
Services, Marketing and Operations. The ESP garnered 
suggestions across business units, job functions 
and grades and has not only managed to promote 
problem-solving, innovation and a business centric 
mind-set on the ground, but also allowed AEON Credit 
to give voice to our workforce at the working level and 
hear their ideas and opinions.
AEON Credit has in place a structured performance 
evaluation system, incorporating target setting 
and annual performance assessments involving 
employees and their superiors. The process covers  
face-to-face interaction to establish clear and specific 
work expectations including KPI/target setting, 
continuous feedback, performance and career 
development review.
An Employee Satisfaction Survey is conducted on a 
needs basis to gauge of employees’ satisfaction level. 
One such survey was conducted in FYE2022 with 80% 
of the respondents out of a total of 1,728 employees 
surveyed reporting satisfaction with the current 
arrangement/atmosphere at AEON Credit on 4 main 
areas of interest namely leadership, communication, 
teamwork/morale and engagement.
We recognise our employees’ exemplary performance 
and contributions. Service excellence and employee 
loyalty are acknowledged annually through various 
awards such as Excellent Staff Awards, Meritorious 
Service Awards, Excellent Customer Service Awards 
and Long Service Awards. The Group will continue 
to review its compensation and benefits policies to 
ensure competitiveness whilst also recognising our 
employees’ contributions and dedication.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Environmental Management
(i) Environmental Conservation
While there have been good intentions and willingness, 
AEON Credit’s ability to execute planned environmental 
conservation initiatives has been severely constrained 
by COVID-19 restrictions. We only managed to embark 
on a single physical activity which was Mangrove 
Tree Planting at Lema’as Forest Reserve, Kota Belud, 
Sabah. A total of 500 trees were planted in the Class 
V Mangrove Forest Reserve in January 2022. For 
FYE2023, the Group is planning to commence with 
Phase 2 plantings for reforestation at Sabal Forest 
Reserve, Simunjan, Sarawak and mangrove plantings 
at Lema’as Forest Reserve, Kota Belud, Sabah.
(ii) Environmental Management System
AEON Credit has obtained certification under 
the Environmental Management System (“EMS”)  
(ISO 14001:2015) standard, covering the Group’s 
processes and practices aimed at reducing 
environmental impact from operations. The (“EMS”) 
certification governs areas such as collecting, recycling 
and disposal of waste appropriately by licenced 
vendors with notification submitted to the Department 
of Environment. 
AEON Credit promotes environmental consciousness 
and conscientious behaviour in support of our 
commitment to minimise our impact on the environment. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we remind all staff  
to properly dispose of face masks and self test kits 
in order to prevent inadvertent spread of the virus  
through unsafe disposal methods. We also conducted 
awareness campaigns, to educate staff on our 
environment’s vulnerability and protecting it to create a 
better tomorrow for our children, for instance reminding 
all staff to join and support the global community by 
switching off non-essential electrical equipment on 
Earth Hour.
We also encourage staff to reduce single-use plastic 
waste during Plastic-free July programme during which 
we challenged our staff to break the plastic habit on a 
daily basis:
•	 Day	1	–	No	plastic	bottle
•	 Day	2	–	No	plastic	utensils
•	 Day	3	–	No	food	container
•	 Day	4	–	No	plastic	bag
AEON Credit, in solidarity with the global community, is committed to instituting climate action to battle the existential threat posed 
by global warming. We are doing our part to reduce our carbon footprint and lend to the collective global efforts at reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. The continued prosperity of our business hinges on the survival and wellbeing of the planet making it 
imperative on us to work as hard as everyone to hold off global warming. Our material sustainability matter under Environmental 
Stewardship pillar is:
(iii) Responsible Consumption
Though our operations are not closely tied to 
natural resources, we are nevertheless commited 
to contributing what we can for the betterment of 
the environment and our planet. A principal way we 
do this is through responsible consumption which 
is embedded and practiced throughout all aspects 
of our business with a focus on 3 key areas, namely 
electricity, paper and water. 
We relentless seek ways to manage our consumption, 
both to further our sustainability commitments and to 
mitigate operational costs. To monitor our consumption 
patterns and as critical inputs in our efforts to manage 
our consumption levels, we collect data on our 
electricity, paper and water consumption, the latter 
which started in September 2021.

Electicity and paper consumption have both 
experienced increases in FYE2022 on the back of 
increased levels of business activities as movement 
controls, though tight, were not as absolute as those 
imposed in FYE2021. As well, instituting various 
financial assistance programmes for our customers 
required administrative effort and the attendant 
consumption of electricity and paper.

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) of AEON Credit Service 
(M) Berhad (“AEON Credit” or “the Company”) hold a strong 
conviction that good corporate governance (“CG”) is pivotal 
to operational efficiency, capital access, risk mitigation and 
overall effective stewardship of business of AEON Credit 
and its subsidiary (“AEON Credit Group” or “the Group”).  
The transparency that will invariably arise through the 
practice of good CG will enhance our accountability and

which manifests in stringent oversight and supervision and 
the Board has established a robust framework for good CG 
to guide our CG and compliance practices. The framework 
is updated regularly to reflect the latest developments and 
regulatory requirements.
This Corporate Governance Overview Statement

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
PRINCIPLE A: BOARD LEADERSHIP
AND EFFECTIVENESS
BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP 
OVERSIGHT
The primary role of the Board is to protect and enhance 
long-term shareholder value. It sets the overall strategy for 
the Group and supervises the Management. It also ensures 
that good corporate governance policies and practices are 
implemented within the Group. In the course of discharging 
its duties, the Board acts in good faith, with due diligence and 
care, in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders. 
Generally, principal roles and responsibilities of the Board 
encompass the following: 
i. Approve business plans, risk appetite, and other initiatives 
that have a material impact on the Group’s risk profile;
ii. Oversee the implementation of the Group’s governance 
and internal control framework, periodically review them 
to ensure they remain relevant and consistent, in light of 
material changes to the size, nature and complexity of the 
Group’s operations;
iii. Promote, together with Senior Management, a sound 
corporate culture within the Group which reinforces 
integrity, ethical and professional behaviour;
iv. Promote sustainability through appropriate environmental, 
social and governance considerations in the Group’s 
business strategies;

and powers as well as the matters that the Board may

Code below:
The Board delegates responsibility for the day-to-day 
operations of the business to the Managing Director 
(“MD”) who is assisted by a Top Management of functional 
experts (collectively “the Management”) recognising their 
responsibilities to ensure that the Group operates within a 
framework of prudent and effective controls. On the other hand, 
the Management exercises oversight and governance over 
execution and provides the Board and the Board Committees 
with the requisite information and specialist advice in a timely 
manner to enable the Directors to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities effectively and yield expected results.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and MD are 
distinct and have been clearly segregated to further enhance 
and preserve a balance of authority and accountability, to 
avoid unfettered powers of decision making. The Chairman, 
who is not a member of the Audit Committee (“AC”),  
Board Risk Committee (“BRC”), Nominating Committee (“NC”) 
and Remuneration Committee (“RC”) is primarily responsible 
for the orderly conduct of the Board meetings and ensures 
effectiveness of the Board and manages the interface 
between the Board and Management. 
The MD ensures effective implementation of the Group’s 
strategic plans, policies and decisions approved by the Board. 
The MD is also responsible for leading and managing the overall 
operations and making business decisions for the Group, with 
the support of the Top Management, within mandates and 
limits of authorities delegated by the Board. Various powers 
are further delegated to the Management team based on 
the Group’s Authority Matrix, which is also subject to periodic 
review based on changes in the organisation structure and 
business requirements for efficient and effective decision 
making.
BOARD MEETINGS AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION
Board meetings are pre-scheduled to take place on a monthly 
basis to enable the Board to stay current on emerging areas 
of interest or concern, facilitate close and regular follow-up of 
on-going matters and to accommodate expeditious decision 
making.
Board and Board Committee meetings are formal forums 
for deliberation of matters of strategic and operational 
significance. Ahead of any such meetings a formal and 
structured agenda and related information are provided to all 
Directors	at	least	5	business	days	in	advance	to	allow	time	for	
review, assimilation and if required, obtain further information 
on matters to be deliberated. Occasionally, the Board or  
Board Committees meetings may be called at short notice 
when critical decisions are required on an urgent basis. 
Attendance of Management member(s) will be called for,  
as necessary, to articulate more detailed information and 
provide specialist perspectives to facilitate and support the 
Board or Board Committees in making informed decisions.
Where specialist input or advice is required for the Board to 
arrive at a well-considered and informed decision, the Board 
may seek the counsel of independent subject matter expert(s) 
at the Group’s expense in accordance with established 
procedures set out in the Board Charter.
Board members have unrestricted access to the advice and 
services of the appointed qualified Company Secretary, 
who is a member of the Malaysian Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators. The Company Secretary is 
equipped with the skills and expertise to provide unhindered 
support and appropriate advice to Directors to ensure the 
Board procedures and relevant regulatory requirements and 
guidelines (including corporate governance issues) are always 
adhered to. 
Besides making arrangements for Board, Board Committees 
and general meetings and drawing up the relevant meeting 
agenda, the Company Secretary also serves in an advisory 
capacity in monitoring developments in corporate governance.  
The Company Secretary also assists the Board in applying 
best practices to meet the Board’s needs and stakeholders’ 
expectations.
The Board is also regularly updated and advised by the 
Management on the overall compliance requirements, 
adherence to regulatory guidelines, statutory requirements as 
well as the associated impact and implications on the Board 
and the Group.
During FYE2022, the Board met sixteen (16) times where it 
deliberated and considered various matters including financial 
results, operational performance, potential investments, 
strategic decisions, risk management, sustainability issues and 
other matters requiring the Board’s decision. All proceedings 
of the Board meetings were minuted and circulated to the 
Board members in advance of the next Board meeting 
including the follow up action items that are duly updated. 
Where necessary, decisions of the Board are also made by 
way of circular resolutions in between scheduled Board 
meetings.
During Board meetings, the Chairman of AC, BRC, NC and RC 
will brief the Board on the salient matters, recommendations, 
significant issues, risk matters and findings which require the 
Board’s attention, approval and direction.

BOARD COMPOSITION, BALANCE AND DIVERSITY
The Board is committed in ensuring that members collectively 
possess the diversity of skills, knowledge and experience 
pivotal to driving the Group forward. This commitment also 
extends to embracing inclusiveness in Board appointments. 
The Board believes diversity would add value to deliberations 
and makes for a balanced view leveraging on different 
perspectives and backed the members’ wealth of experience. 
To this end, the Board considers diversity from a number of 
different aspects, including skills, background, knowledge, 
international and industry experience, culture, independence, 
age, ethnicity, gender and any other factors which the Board 
thinks fit. Sourcing the right Board members is a continuing 
priority and is always conducted in accordance with Board’s 
Corporate Governance agenda in order to achieve the right 
diversity in the Board. 
The Board currently consists of ten (10) members, 
comprising the Chairman who is a Non-Independent  
Non-Executive Director, six (6) Independent Directors, one (1)  
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and two (2) 
Executive Directors, including the MD. In terms of gender 
diversity, 40% of the Board members are female, exceeding 
the regulators’ target of 30% female board representation. 
Reflecting the Board’s commitment to independence,  
60% of the current Board members are Independent Directors,  
this proportion complies with Bank Negara Malaysia (“BNM”) 
CG Policy and is over and above that prescribed under the 
MMLR of Bursa Securities.
The present size and composition of the Board is considered 
to be optimum and well balanced, whilst bringing experience 
from diverse professional backgrounds and disciplines.  
Further, Board diversity will equip the Group to face 
challenges of an intensely competitive industry environment 
and its constantly evolving risk profile. There is no individual 
Director or group of Directors who dominate the Board’s  
decision-making. A summary of the Board composition as at

The Anti-Bribery Policy signifies a commitment of the 
Group in conducting its business with integrity, sincerity 
and ethically. Anti-bribery programmes are essential

bribery risk, in line with AEON’s Code of Conduct.  
In upholding the above commitment, the Group shall:
1. Adopt zero tolerance of all forms of bribery.

oversee the implementation of anti-bribery programs. 
Hence, the Group strictly does not tolerate any act of 
bribery and corruption and requires all of our business 
associates (including its employees, directors, agents, 
representatives and sub-contractors) to be aware and 
adhere to the provisions related to bribery and corruption. 
Should there be any act of corruption, bribery, conflicts of 
interest or similar unethical acts, all parties must disclose 
this via the appropriate whistle-blowing channels in 
order to  discourage bribery of all forms related to AEON 
Credit’s operations.
(iv)  Gift and Entertainment Policy
In our continued effort to promote business ethics, 
the Group requires all employees to demonstrate the 
highest standards of ethics and comply with AEON Code 
of Conducts when dealing with potential and existing

COVID-19 PANDEMIC RISk
The COVID-19 pandemic continued into FYE2022 with 
resolution not expected in the immediate future. However, 
the Group has gained much experience over the past year in 
formulating and executing effective responses to address the 
various challenges arising to ensure business continuity.
Across FYE2022 there were intermittent Movement Control 
Orders (“MCO”) in various forms to align pandemic curbing 
measure to the changing risk scenarios. As with the previous 
year when the pandemic started, the Board continued to 
strongly support the Management in the various efforts 
implemented to manage the crisis particularly involving 
employees, customers, business partners, communities and 
other stakeholders. The Management on their part diligently 
kept the Board abreast on crisis management and business 
continuity measures as well as the efficacy of these measures, 
recommending and implementing remediations where 
needed.
The strong relationship and support between the Board and 
Management has contributed to the agility and effectiveness 
of the Group’s pandemic responses lending to the Group’s 
continuing resilience. This symbiotic relationship has proven 
crucial for the Group’s business continuity and our ability to 
seamlessly move forward in a risk-managed manner.

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The Board has established an in-house internal audit  
function. The primary responsibility of the Internal 
Audit Division is to provide independent and objective  
assessment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk 
management, internal control, anti-corruption, whistle-blowing 
and governance processes implemented by Management. 
The Internal Audit Division’s mission, scope of work, 
responsibilities and authority are governed by its Internal 
Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. As guided by 
the Internal Audit Charter, Policy and Procedure, the Internal 
Audit Division maintained their independence and impartiality 
on the activities and functions it audits. To reflect the audit 
objectivity and independence of the internal audit function, 
the Internal Audit Division reports functionally to the AC and 
administratively to the Managing Director, and has unfettered 
access to the AC. Through this reporting relationship,  
the AC also ensured that the Internal Audit Division has the 
authority to carry out their work objectively and independently. 
During the year under review, the Head of Internal Audit and 
all internal auditors have confirmed to the AC in December 
2021 via the annual declaration that they were free from any 
relationships or conflict of interest which could impair their 
objectivity and independence in their audit engagements.
Internal Audit’s scope of coverage encompassed all business 
and support units. In relation to this, all auditable areas were 
risk ranked using risk-based audit planning methodology to 
prioritise the audit work and to scope the audits on high risk 
auditable areas. These were guided and defined in the Annual 
Audit Plan for the financial year ended 28 February 2022, 
which was approved by the AC in December 2020. 
During the year under review, the Internal Audit Division 
conducted the internal audit engagements in accordance 
with the approved Annual Audit Plan to review the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the risk management, internal 
control, anti-corruption, whistle-blowing and governance 
processes implemented by Management as well as to 
evaluate compliance with relevant policies, procedures 
and regulations, which encompassed auditing the Group’s 
business and support functions (including the regional offices 
and branches), information systems, IT operations & security, 
J-SOX assessment and Outsourced Service Providers. 
Accordingly, the Internal Audit Division also reviewed the 
recurrent related party transactions on a quarterly basis, and 
participated as an independent observer during the Business 
Continuity Plan test, Disaster Recovery Plan tests, and Cyber 
Security Drill Exercise carried out by the Group during the year 
under review. 
Other key focus areas audited by Internal Audit Division during 
the year under review included the following:
•	 Conducted	compliance	reviews	based	on	policy	documents	
and guidelines issued by the regulatory authority on areas 
such as Anti-Money Laundering & Counter Financing of 
Terrorism (AML/CFT), management of customer information 
& permitted disclosure, managing risk associated with 
payment instruments, product transparency & disclosure, 
credit card, e-money and payment card reform framework.
•	 Performed	thematic	internal	audit	reviews	on	areas	such	
as Anti-Bribery Management System (ISO37001:2016), 
Information Security Management System (ISO27001:2013), 
Quality Management System (ISO9001:2015) and 
Environmental Management System (ISO14001:2015).
Control deficiencies/gaps and areas for improvements noted 
from these audits were highlighted to the appropriate level of 
Management for resolution. Root cause of issues noted was 
assessed to enable relevant recommendations and ensure 
remedial measures are taken to address the audit issues. 
Internal Audit Division also tabled the audit issues, root cause 
and remedial action plans thereto, as well as the progress of 
remedial actions taken on open audit issues, at the monthly 
Internal Audit Meetings attended by the Managing Director, 
Executive Director and Executive Officers of the Group for 
review and deliberation.
Internal Audit Reports arising from the audits and reviews 
conducted by Internal Audit Division and the progress of 
actions taken or to be taken to resolve the issues, were 
tabled to the AC for review and deliberation at the scheduled  
AC Meetings held on 31 March 2021, 29 June 2021,  
21 September 2021 and 15 December 2021. The relevant 
Managements of the operating units are responsible to 
ensure that remedial measures are taken on reported audit 
issues within the required timeframe. Follow-up reviews were 
conducted by Internal Audit Division and status updates were 
provided to the AC on the progress of remedial measures 
taken.
The total cost incurred in respect of the internal audit function 
for the financial year under review was in the region of 
RM2,270,000 (FYE2021: RM2,045,000).

STATEMENT ON RISk MANAGEMENT 
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
INTRODUCTION

Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) Main Market Listing Requirements 
(“MMLR”), the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of a listed 
issuer is required to include in its Integrated Annual Report.  
This Statement, which outlines the nature and the main 
key features of risk management and internal control 
systems within AEON Credit Service (M) Berhad and 
its subsidiary (“the Group”) for the financial year ended  
28 February 2022 (“FYE2022”), has been prepared in 
accordance to:
a) Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control – 
Guidelines for Directors of Public Listed Issuers which was 
endorsed by Bursa Securities; and
b) Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”) 
issued by Securities Commission Malaysia.
Board Responsibilities
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving 
the Group’s overall risk strategy, including risk appetite,  
risk tolerance and overseeing its implementation to support 
the sustainability initiatives of the Group. The Board also 
acknowledges the presence of a sound internal control 
systems in safeguarding shareholders’ interest, as well as 
to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
In light of the above, the Board affirms that there is a proper 
risk management processes in place to identify, evaluate and 
manage significant or emerging risks that could derail the 
Group’s aim in meeting its objectives.
The risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure 
in the achievement of goals and objectives of the Group. 
The system can therefore only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against the occurrence of material 
misstatement or loss, and that the risk management processes 
are designed to minimise or mitigate it.
In acknowledging that having a sound risk management 
and internal control systems are crucial, the Board has 
established a governance structure that ensures effective 
oversight of risks and internal controls in the Group.  
For this, the Board is assisted by the Audit Committee 
(“AC”) and Board Risk Committee (“BRC”) to provide primary 
oversight responsibilities on the Group’s risk management 
and internal control activities. The Board remains responsible 
for the governance of the risk and internal controls with regard 
to the execution of the delegated oversight responsibilities.
For the FYE2022, five (5) BRC meetings were conducted 
with the purpose of overseeing the Group’s risk and 
compliance particularly on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of risk management and compliance processes. The BRC is 
also responsible to review the Group’s sustainability related 
matters, including Sustainability Framework, material matters 
covering Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) risks, 
and sustainability reporting. For more details on the function of 
the BRC, please refer to BRC Report on page 94.
Management Responsibilities
The Management’s overall responsibility is to assist the Board 
in implementing the Group’s policies and procedures on risk 
and control by:
•	 Identifying,	 assessing,	 monitoring	 and	 reporting	 risks	
and internal control, as well as taking proper actions. 
In identifying and mitigating or minimising the risks,  
it is relevant to the business of the Group to ensure the

actions taken.

Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects 
with the necessary processes being implemented.
RISk MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The key functions and processes that the Board has 
established in reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of 
risk management and internal control systems include the 
following:
Risk Management
The Enterprise Risk Management Framework (“ERMF”) has 
become an important driver to address the risks the Group 
inevitably faces in delivering its strategies while balancing 
the appropriate level of risk taken without exposing itself 
to unacceptable potential losses or reputational damage. 
The ERMF has strengthened the risk management practices 
through integration of ERMF with business practices for 
better decision making and ultimately enhance business 
performance to preserve the Group’s long-term value.
AEON CREDIT SERVICE (M) BERHAD

---- Page 99 ----
The key features of the ERMF include:
Risk Appetite
It is defined as the amount and types of risk that the Group is 
willing to accept, in pursuit of its business objectives.
The Group’s risk appetite is an integral component of 
the Group’s robust risk management framework. The risk 
appetite also provides a structure in understanding risk and is 
embedded in the day-to-day business activities.
Risk Governance and Oversight
Risk governance provides a formalised and transparent 
structure that promotes involvement from the Board and 
management in the risk management processes to ensure a 
uniformed view of risk across the Group.
The three lines of defence address specific duties and 
responsibilities related to risk and control functions 
coordinated within the Group:
1st Line of Defence – Risk Taking
The first lines of defence shall be managed by Business 
Units (“BU”) who has day-to-day ownership and 
management over risks and controls.
2nd Line of Defence – Risk Controlling
The second line of defence supports Senior Management 
by monitoring and reviewing the first line of defence to 
ensure risks and controls are properly managed. Essentially,  
this is a management and oversight function that owns 
aspects of the risk management and compliance 
processes.
3rd Line of Defence – Assurance Party
The third line of defence provides assurance to Senior 
Management and the Board that the first and second 
lines efforts are consistent and meet the expectations.  
This assurance function performed by Internal Audit 
Division.
In providing effective oversight function, BRC is assisted 
by the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) to review 
the effectiveness of risk management, compliance, legal, 
sustainability and other governance related matters.  
The RMC comprises the key management team of the 
Group, which includes the Chief Risk Officer as Chairman 
and Group/Business Unit Heads as RMC members.  
The RMC meetings, coordinated by the Risk Management are 
held on monthly basis, to address risk, compliance and other 
related matters together with mitigating measures, reviewing 
policies and procedures and deliberating emerging issues 
that possibly impact the Group. Any new or amended policies 
and procedures related to risk, compliance and other related 
matters are reviewed by the RMC, recommended by the BRC 
and subsequently approved by the Board.
During the financial year, the Group has continuously 
reviewed and revised relevant policies in order to strengthen 
the overall governance. A key revision was made for  
Anti-Money Laundering & Counter Financing of Terrorism 
(“AML/CFT”) Policy and Compliance Framework. In accordance 
to the Policy Document of AML/CFT issued by Bank Negara 
Malaysia, the Group has appointed a Compliance Officer at 
Management level to oversee AML/CFT related matters.  
The role and responsibility of the appointed Compliance 
Officer have been stated accordingly in the AML/CFT Policy 
and Compliance Framework.
In FYE2022, the Group has obtained recertification 
on Integrated Management System (“IMS”) which is a 
combination of ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System, 
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management 
System (“ISMS”) and ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 
Management System (“EMS”) into one coherent system.  
The IMS certification is evident that the Group aims to  
integrate quality, information security and environmental 
management responsibilities while ensuring that the 
processes are seamlessly managed and executed. 
The Group has established various Management Committees 
and Meetings to assist and support the Board. Generally, 
there are two (2) meeting categories which are the Board 
Level Meeting and the Company Level Meeting. The Board 
Level Meeting is supported by four (4) committees whereas 
the Company Level Meeting is supported by twelve (12) 
committees and meetings. The committees have specific 
roles and mandates to provide comprehensive oversight and 
controls functions within the Group.
The Company has been identified as a significant  
subsidiary of the holding corporation, AEON Financial  
Service Co., Ltd. Japan (“AFSJ”). As a significant subsidiary,  
the Company is required to comply with the AFSJ’s  
Framework of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
(“Japanese Sarbanes-Oxley or J-SOX”). Pursuant to that, 
the Management through Internal Audit Division, regularly 
conducts evaluation of internal controls in the Group to 
identify any significant impact on internal controls and  
financial reporting. In addition, on annual basis, the 
Company has engaged Messrs. Deloitte PLT to assess the  
effectiveness of existing internal controls and financial 
reporting.
Risk and Compliance Culture
Risk Management and Compliance continuously seek to 
build a strong risk management and compliance culture by 
promoting awareness, ownership and accountability. Training, 
e-learning and awareness are being emphasised in order to 
promote the risk and compliance culture.
The Risk and Compliance related policies and procedures are 
reviewed on a periodic basis to meet changes in the business 
environment, as well as the requirements of applicable law 
and regulations.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
As part of the risk and compliance culture, the Group has  
instilled a culture where the Board, Management and all 
employees of the Group are committed to adhere to the 
requirement of relevant laws and regulations. This commitment 
is clearly demonstrated through the establishment and 
strengthening of policies, processes and controls in  
managing and preventing non-compliance.
Risk Management Process
a) Risk Identification
It is a process of identification, understanding and 
assessment of inherent risk for relevant products,  
new products or processes and business initiatives.  
It enables early detection of risk and ensures sound risk 
management practices are in place.
b) Risk Evaluation and Treatment
A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods 
are used by the Management to assess and evaluate 
the risk identified from two perspectives – risk likelihood 
and impact parameters. Management will then decide,  
in consultation with RMC on the risk treatment options for 
subsequent implementation. Treatment options are being 
monitored and tracked till closure in order to mitigate the 
identified risk effectively from future occurrence.
c) Risk Monitoring and Reporting
Monitoring of early warning and key indicators are crucial 
in alerting the management on any potential risk events,  
and to put in place timely action to mitigate the potential risk. 
The results are then being reported and communicated at 
the respective platform.
d) Communication
The Group, through the RMC, continuously communicates 
and engages with stakeholders to identify possible risks in 
addition to the events and circumstances that could affect 
the achievement of the objectives which includes the 
realisation of the opportunities.
Internal Control Systems
The Board is responsible for managing the key business 
risks of the Group and implementing an appropriate internal 
control systems to manage those risks. The AC, assisted 
by the Internal Audit Division, provides the Board with the 
assurance it requires on the adequacy and integrity of the 
system of internal controls. The AC has an oversight function 
of all activities carried out by the Internal Audit Division.
To ensure that a sound system of controls is in place, the Board 
has established primary processes in reviewing the adequacy 
and integrity of the system of internal controls. The primary 
processes include:
•	 An	annual	business	plan	and	budget	which	are	submitted	
to the Board for approval. Actual performances are 
reviewed against the targeted results on a monthly basis 
for Management responses and actions, where applicable. 
Board reviews monthly reports from the management on the 
key operating statistics and risk management, and feedback 
on actions required are furnished to the senior management 
team.
•	 The	Group’s	core	values	and	Code	of	Conducts	are	the	
essential guiding principles which are observed in all 
business dealings and sets out standards of good practice 
to be observed by all staff.
•	 The	corporate	 decision	 authority	 matrix,	 corporate	
purchasing authority matrix and respective business units’ 
authority matrix with defined empowerment and authority 
serves as a framework in regulating all business activities 
and decisions within the Group.
•	 The	Group	has	in	place	written	operating	procedures	in	
various areas of operations, which also incorporate risk 
management issues and updated as and when necessary 
to improve on the control environment and operational 
efficiency.
All the above mentioned processes are in place with the aim to 
provide reasonable assurance as to the accuracy of financial 
information, non-financial disclosures, the Group’s compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations, and the effectiveness of 
the internal control systems. The Board will conduct reviews 
on a continuous basis to ensure the effectiveness, adequacy 
and integrity of the system of internal controls in safeguarding 
the Group’s assets and stakeholders’ interests.

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for 
doubtful debts, and had satisfied that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made 
for doubtful debts; and
(ii) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including the value of 
current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount 
which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
misleading; or
(iii) which have arisen which would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and 
the of Company misleading or inappropriate; or
(iv) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any 
amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

(i) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which 
secures the liability of any other person; or

No contingent or other liability has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months 
after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Group and of the 
Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors:
(i) the results of the Group’s and of the Company’s operations during the financial year were not substantially affected by any 
item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and

event of a material and unusual nature which is likely to affect substantially the results of the Group and of the Company’s 
operations for the financial year in which this report is made.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of AEON CREDIT SERVICE (M) BERHAD, which comprise the statements of financial 
position of the Group and of the Company as at 28 February 2022, and the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive 
income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, 
and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 110 to 173.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 28 February 2022, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. 
Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities 
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and 
Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ 
International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”),  
and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of 
the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter Our audit performed and responses thereon
Impairment of financing receivables
As at 28 February 2022, financing receivables stand at 
RM9,101,111,000 (2021: RM9,236,046,000) representing 
89.7% (2021: 90.3%) of total assets of the Group and of the 
Company. MFRS 9 requires such financing receivables to 
be measured using expected credit losses (ECL) model. 
The measurement of ECL is complex and requires the 
application of significant judgement which includes 
the identification of credit exposures with significant 
deterioration in credit quality, assumptions used in the 
ECL models such as the expected future cash flows,  
time value of money, forward-looking macroeconomic 
factors and probability-weighted multiple scenarios. 
Refer to the significant accounting policy in Note 3 to 
the financial statements, the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty in Note 4, the disclosure of financing 
receivables in Note 11 to the financial statements.
Our audit procedures included, among others: 
Evaluation of the design and implementation of key controls over 
impairment of financing receivables, including the governance 
over the ECL methodology and model development. 
With the involvement of financial risk specialists, we have:
•	 assessed	whether	 the	 Group’s	 and	 the	 Company’s	 ECL	
model on financing receivables is in accordance with MFRS 9.  
The assessment includes assessment of significant 
assumptions and considerations applied by the Group and 
the Company in the ECL model to address the requirements 
of MFRS 9 such as criteria for significant deterioration in credit 
quality, time value of money, forward-looking macroeconomic 
factors and probability-weighted multiple scenarios;
•	 recomputed	the	Group’s	and	the	Company’s	impairment	based	
on the ECL model and compared against the impairment of 
financing receivables recorded by the Group and the Company; 
•	 assessed	the	reasonableness	and	tested	the	identification	and	
calculation of the overlay adjustments to the ECL due to the 
impact of COVID-19; and
•	 verified	the	inputs	into	the	ECL	model	developed	to	ensure	
accuracy and completeness.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the annual report but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report 
thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the 
Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards 
and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing,  
we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
•	 Identify	and	 assess	 the	 risks	 of	 material	 misstatement	 of	 the	 financial	 statements	 of	 the	 Group	 and	 of	 the	 Company,	 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from  
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control. 
•	 Obtain	an	understanding	of	internal	control	relevant	to	the	audit	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	appropriate	in	
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s 
internal control. 
•	 Evaluate	the	appropriateness	of	accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	accounting	estimates	and	related	
disclosures made by the Directors.
•	 Conclude	on	the	appropriateness	of	the	Directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	and,	based	on	the	audit	
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Company 
to cease to continue as a going concern.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
•	 Evaluate	the	overall	presentation,	structure	and	content	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	of	the	Company,	 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.
•	 Obtain	sufficient	appropriate	audit	evidence	regarding	the	financial	information	of	the	entities	or	business	activities	within	the	
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matter. We describe 
the matter in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 
2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless 
otherwise stated in the significant accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for assets.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group and the Company take into 
account the characteristics of the asset or liability on the same basis market participants would take those characteristics 
into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure 
purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for any share-based payment transactions 
that are within the scope of MFRS 2 Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of MFRS 16 
Leases and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in  
MFRS 102 Inventories or value-in-use in MFRS 136 Impairment of Assets.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the 
degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value 
measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
•	 Level	1	inputs	are	quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities	that	the	entity	can	assess	
at the measurement date;
•	 Level	2	are	inputs,	other	than	quoted	prices	included	within	Level	1,	that	are	observable	for	the	asset	or	liability,	 
either directly or indirectly; and
•	 Level	3	are	unobservable	inputs	for	the	asset	or	liability.
The principal accounting policies are set out below: 
Basis of consolidation
The Group prepared its first consolidated financial statements in financial year ended 28 February 2022 upon acquisition 
of a subsidiary as disclosed in Note 7.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary made up to 
28 February each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
•	 has	the	power	over	the	investee;
•	 is	exposed,	or	has	rights,	to	variable	returns	from	its	involvement	with	the	investee;	and
•	 has	the	ability	to	use	its	power	to	affect	its	returns.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Basis of consolidation (continued)
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes 
to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the 
investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee 
unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting 
rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:
•	 the	size	of	the	Company’s	holding	of	voting	rights	relative	to	the	size	and	dispersion	of	holdings	of	the	other	vote	holders;
•	 potential	voting	rights	held	by	the	Company,	other	vote	holders	or	other	parties;
•	 rights	arising	from	other	contractual	arrangements;	and
•	 any	additional	facts	and	circumstances	that	indicate	that	the	Company	has,	or	does	not	have,	the	current	ability	to	direct	
the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ 
meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company 
loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in 
profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiary to bring the accounting policies used into 
line with the Group’s accounting policies.
All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the members 
of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of  
non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net 
assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition 
basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the 
non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and 
to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the 
Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as 
the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained 
interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any 
non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary 
are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified 
to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as required/permitted by applicable Standards). The fair value 
of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial 
recognition for subsequent accounting under MFRS 9 when applicable, or the cost on initial recognition of an investment 
in an associate or a joint venture.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business 
combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred 
by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
For new acquisitions, the Group measures the cost of goodwill at the acquisition date as:
•	 the	fair	value	of	the	consideration	transferred;	plus
•	 the	recognised	amount	of	any	non-controlling	interests	in	the	acquiree;	plus
•	 if	the	business	combination	is	achieved	in	stages,	the	fair	value	of	the	existing	equity	interest	in	the	acquiree;	less
•	 the	net	recognised	amount	(generally	fair	value)	of	the	identifiable	assets	acquired	and	liabilities	assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at 
fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection 
with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiary are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of  
non-controlling shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net 
assets upon liquidation may initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition 
basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the 
non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and 
to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in Group’s ownership interest in existing subsidiary
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the 
Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as 
the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained 
interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any 
non-controlling interests. All amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary 
are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e. reclassified 
to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as required/permitted by applicable Standards). The fair value 
of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial 
recognition for subsequent accounting under MFRS 9 when applicable, or the cost on initial recognition of an investment 
in an associate or a joint venture.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Investment in a subsidiary company
Investment in a subsidiary company, which is eliminated on consolidation, is stated at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses, if any in the Company’s financial statements. On disposal of such an investment, the difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is included in profit or loss.
Goodwill on consolidation
Goodwill arising on consolidation is initially recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any 
accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the 
CGUs is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro-rata basis of the carrying amount of each 
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary company, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or 
loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when a performance obligation in the contract with a customer is satisfied, i.e. when the 
“control” of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.  
A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct goods or services (or a series of distinct goods or services that 
are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer) to the customer that is explicitly stated in the contract 
and implied in the Group’s and Company’s customary business practices.
(i) Interest income/profit revenue and finance charges from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes 
and credit card business
Interest income/profit revenue and finance charges from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes and 
credit card business are recognised in profit or loss using the Effective Interest/Profit Rate (“EIR”) method.
EIR is a method of calculating the amortised cost of financing receivables and of allocating the corresponding interest 
income/profit revenue and finance charges over the relevant year. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future cash receipts through the expected life of the financing receivable or, when appropriate, a shorter year to the 
net carrying amount of the financing receivables.
(ii) Fee income from easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes, credit card business and extended 
warranty program
Fee income from easy payment schemes and personal financing schemes comprise late payment/penalty charges, 
processing fees and credit recovery charges. Fee income from credit card business comprises credit recovery charges, 
cash advance fees, transaction charges, annual fees, merchant commission and Visa/MasterCard interchange fees. 
Fee income from extended warranty program comprises commission earned for referral of extended warranty program.

Employee benefits
(a) Short-term employee benefits
Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the period in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and of the Company. Short-term accumulating 
compensated absences for paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees that increase 
their entitlement to future compensated absences. Short-term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick 
leave are recognised when the absences occur.
(b) Defined contribution plan
The Group and the Company are required by law to make monthly contributions to the Employees Provident Fund 
(“EPF”), a statutory defined contribution plan, for all its eligible employees based on certain prescribed rates of the 
employees’ salaries. The Group’s and the Company’s contributions to EPF are disclosed separately.
Foreign currency transactions
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are presented in RM, the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group and the Company operate (their functional currency).
In preparing the financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Group’s and the Company’s functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end 
of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the 
end of the reporting period. 
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included 
in profit or loss for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are 
included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of 
which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that 
gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Current tax is the expected amount of income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year and is measured 
using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Current tax for 
current and prior years is recognised as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or recoverable).
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination)  
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In addition,  
a deferred tax liability is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.  
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is 
probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused 
tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investment in subsidiary except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.

Income tax (continued)
Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  
The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in 
which the Group and the Company expect, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its 
assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it arises from a transaction which is 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly in other comprehensive income or to equity. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group and  
the Company intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Earnings per ordinary share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares (“EPS”).
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company, less distribution on 
perpetual notes and perpetual sukuk, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Ordinary shares 
that would be issued upon conversion of a mandatorily convertible instrument are included in the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares from the date of issuance of the instrument.
Leases
(i) Definition of a lease
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:
•	 the	contract	involves	the	use	of	an	identified	asset	that	may	be	specified	explicitly	or	implicitly,	and	should	be	
physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a 
substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;
•	 the	customer	has	the	right	to	obtain	substantially	all	of	the	economic	benefits	from	use	of	the	asset	throughout	the	
period of use; and
•	 the	customer	has	the	right	to	direct	the	use	of	the	asset.	The	customer	has	this	right	when	it	has	the	decision-making	
rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where the 
decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the customer has the right to direct 
the use of the asset if either the customer has the right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset in 
a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.
At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group and the Company allocate 
the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone 
prices.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Leases (continued)
(ii) Recognition and initial measurement
Company as a lessee
The Group and the Company recognise a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate 
of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is 
located, less any lease incentives received.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement 
date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group and 
the Company use their incremental borrowing rate. 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:
•	 Fixed	payments,	including	in-substance	fixed	payments	less	any	incentives	receivable;
•	 Variable	lease	payments	that	depend	on	an	index	or	a	rate,	initially	measured	using	the	index	or	rate	as	at	the	
commencement date;
•	 Amounts	expected	to	be	payable	under	a	residual	value	guarantee;	
•	 The	exercise	price	under	a	purchase	option	that	the	Group	and	the	Company	are	reasonably	certain	to	exercise	the	
option; and
•	 Payments	of	penalties	for	early	termination	of	a	lease,	if	the	lease	term	reflects	the	exercise	of	an	option	to	terminate	
the lease unless the Group and the Company are reasonably certain not to terminate early.
The Group and the Company have excluded variable lease payments that are linked to future performance or usage 
of the underlying asset from the lease liability. Instead, these payments are recognised in profit or loss in the period in 
which the performance or use occurs.
The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets. The Group and the Company recognise 
the lease payments associated with these leases as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(iii) Subsequent measurement
The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to 
the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful 
lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition,  
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of 
the lease liability. 
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a 
change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a revision of in-substance fixed 
lease payments, or if there is a change in the Group’s and the Company’s estimates of the amount expected to be 
payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group and the Company change their assessment of whether they 
will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other costs directly 
attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the cost of dismantling and removing 
the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the 
related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
When significant parts of an item of plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of plant and equipment.
An item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected 
from its use or disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the net carrying amount is 
recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company 
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.  
All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are 
incurred.
(ii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual 
assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that 
component is depreciated separately.
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component 
of an item of plant and equipment. Assets under capital-work-in-progress are not depreciated until the assets are ready 
for their intended use. 
The principal annual rates are as follows:
Office equipment 4 - 7 years
Computer equipment and software 2 - 10 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Furniture and fittings 2 - 4 years
Renovation 4 - 5 years
The depreciable amount is determined after deducting the residual value.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of each reporting period.
Impairment of non-financial assets 
The carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is 
recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been 
adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased 
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) 
in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Financial assets
(i) Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group and the 
Company become a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
A financial asset is initially measured at fair value plus or minus, for an item not measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issuance.
(ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
The Group and the Company have applied MFRS 9 and classified the financial assets in the following measurement 
categories - amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or fair value through profit or 
loss (“FVTPL”).
The Group and the Company determine the classification of financial assets upon initial recognition. The financial 
assets are not subsequently reclassified unless the Group or the Company change the business model for managing 
financial assets in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period 
following the change of the business model.
(a) Amortised cost
Financial assets are measured at amortised cost if the financial assets are held within a business model whose 
objective is to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Interest income/profit revenue and 
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised 
in profit or loss.
(b) FVTOCI
The Group and the Company designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as 
financial assets measured at FVTOCI on initial recognition. Investments in equity instruments are initially measured 
at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising 
from changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve. 
The cumulative gain or loss is not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the equity investments; instead, it is 
transferred to retained earnings. 
Dividends on equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s or the Company’s right to 
receive payment is established. 
(c) FVTPL 
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI as described above are measured 
at FVTPL. This includes derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group and the Company may 
irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or 
at FVTOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise 
arise. Financial assets categorised as FVTPL are subsequently measured at their fair value with gains or losses 
recognised in the profit or loss.

Financial assets (continued)
(iii) Derecognition of financial assets
(a) Derecognition due to substantial modification of terms and conditions
The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset, such as a financing to a customer, when the terms and 
conditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financing, with the difference 
recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. 
The newly recognised financing are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes.
When assessing whether or not to derecognise a financing to a customer, amongst others, the Group and the 
Company consider the following factors:
•	 If	the	customer	is	in	financial	difficulty,	whether	the	modification	merely	reduces	the	contractual	cash	flows	to	
amounts the customer is expected to be able to pay;
•	 Significant	extension	of	the	financing	term	when	the	customer	is	not	in	financial	difficulty;	and
•	 Significant	change	in	the	interest/profit	rate.
If the modification does not result in cash flows that are substantially different, the modification does not result 
in derecognition. Based on the change in cash flows discounted at the original EIR, the Group and the Company 
record a modification gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.
(b) Derecognition other than for substantial modification 
The Group and the Company derecognise a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership 
of the asset to another entity. If the Group or the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group or the Company recognises 
its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group or  
the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset,  
the Group or the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised 
borrowing for the proceeds received.
On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition 
of an investment in an equity instrument which the Group or the Company has elected on initial recognition to 
measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve is 
not reclassified to profit or loss, but is transferred to retained earnings. 
Impairment of financial assets
Under MFRS 9, impairment model requires the recognition of expected credit loss (“ECL”) for all financial assets, except for 
financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity instruments classified under FVTOCI, which are not subject 
to impairment assessment. 
The Group and the Company assess ECL associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost. The Group 
and the Company recognise a loss allowance for such losses at the end of each reporting period. The measurement of ECL 
reflects an unbiased amount that is determined by reasonable as well as supportable information that is available without 
undue cost or effort at the end of the reporting period about past events and current conditions.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Impairment of financial assets (continued)
Allowance for impairment will be made based on the following three-stage approach which reflects the change in credit 
quality of the financial instrument since initial recognition:
(i) Stage 1: 12-month ECL - not credit-impaired
For exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and that are 
not credit-impaired upon origination, the ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring within next  
12 months will be recognised. 
(ii) Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired
For exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but that are not  
credit-impaired, a lifetime ECL will be recognised. 
(iii) Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired
Financial assets are assessed as credit-impaired when one or more events that have detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. For financial assets that are credit-impaired, a lifetime ECL will 
be recognised. 
The measurement of ECL is a function of the probability of default (“PD”), loss given default (“LGD”) (i.e. the magnitude of the 
loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default (“EAD”). The assessment of the PD and LGD are based on the Group’s 
historical experience and informed credit assessment with consideration of forward-looking information described below.
As for the EAD, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for financial 
guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with any additional 
amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend, the Group’s 
understanding of the specific future financing needs of the customers, and other relevant forward-looking information. 
In the measurement of ECL, forward-looking adjustment is in accordance with the expected future macroeconomic 
conditions, including combination of statistical analysis and expert judgements based on the availability of detailed 
information. In addition, key macroeconomic variables encompassed in ECL measurement include probability-weighted 
scenarios based on available forecasts.
Significant increase in credit risk
At the end of each reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk for exposures since initial recognition to determine whether the exposure is subject to 12-month ECL or lifetime 
ECL. This is performed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life from the reporting date 
and the date of initial recognition. When determining whether the risk of default has increased significantly since initial 
recognition, the Group and the Company consider both quantitative information and analysis based on the Group’s and the 
Company’s historical experience. 
The Group and the Company assess whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly on an individual 
or collective basis. For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on a basis of 
shared credit risk characteristics, taking into account the collection mode, disbursement period and other relevant factors. 
If, in a subsequent period, the asset quality improves and also reverses any previously assessed significant increase in 
credit risk since origination, then the loss allowance for that financial asset reverts from lifetime ECL to 12-month ECL.
The Group and the Company determine whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on number of 
days past due since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are 
determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower. The Group and the Company 
presume that the credit risk of a borrower has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payment are 
more than 30 days past due.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
Credit impaired (default)
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether financial assets at amortised cost are credit impaired. 
A financial asset is credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows on the financial assets have occurred. 
The Group and the Company consider a financial asset to be in default when the principal or interest/profit or both the 
financing is past due for more than 90 days.
Forward-looking information
Forward-looking information considered include the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s and the 
Company’s customers work in, obtained from reports of economic experts, financial analysts, governmental bodies, 
relevant think-tanks and other similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and 
forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s and the Company’s core operations.
Write-offs 
The Group and the Company write-off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the customer is in severe 
financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement 
activities under the Group’s and the Company’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. 
Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another 
enterprise, or to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially unfavourable.  
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at “FVTPL” or “other financial liabilities”. 
Other financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
The EIR method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of 
the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the 
recognition of a new liability, and the differences in the respective carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its 
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(a) Perpetual notes
Perpetual notes are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to redeem the instrument. Distributions 
on perpetual notes are recognised in equity in the year in which they are paid. The transaction costs of an equity 
transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of tax. Equity transaction costs comprise only those 
incremental external costs directly attributable to the equity transaction which would otherwise have been avoided.

Equity instruments (continued)
(b) Perpetual sukuk
Perpetual sukuk is classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to redeem the instrument. Distributions 
on perpetual sukuk are recognised in equity in the year in which they are paid. The transaction costs of an equity 
transaction are accounted for as a deduction from equity, net of tax. Equity transaction costs comprise only those 
incremental external costs directly attributable to the equity transaction which would otherwise have been avoided.
(c) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. Costs directly attributable to equity transactions are accounted for 
as a deduction, net of tax, from equity. 
Distributions to holders of ordinary shares are debited directly to equity and interim dividends declared on or before 
the end of the reporting date are recognised as liabilities. Final dividends are recognised upon the approval of 
shareholders in a general meeting.
Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stocks (“ICULS”)
The ICULS are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.  
The component of ICULS that exhibits characteristics of a liability is recognised as a financial liability in the statement of 
financial position. 
The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the future contractual cash flows of principal and 
interest payments at the prevailing market rate for equivalent non-convertible loan stocks. This amount is carried as liability 
on the amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the instruments. 
The interest on ICULS are recognised as finance cost in the profit or loss using the EIR method.
The fair value of the equity component represented by the conversion option is determined by deducting fair value of the 
liability component from the notional amount of the loan stocks and is included in equity.
Derivative instruments
The Group and the Company enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign 
exchange rate risks, including foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. 
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss immediately unless the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group and the Company document the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group and the Company document 
whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable 
to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:
•	 there	is	an	economic	relationship	between	the	hedged	item	and	the	hedging	instrument;
•	 the	effect	of	credit	risk	does	not	dominate	the	value	changes	that	result	from	that	economic	relationship;	and
•	 the	hedge	ratio	of	the	hedging	relationship	is	the	same	as	that	resulting	from	the	quantity	of	the	hedged	item	that	the	
Group and the Company actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group and the Company 
actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

Cash flow hedge
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable in a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect the profit or loss. The effective 
portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives and other qualifying hedging instruments that are designated and qualify 
as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of hedging reserve, 
limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to 
the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Subsequently, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity into profit 
or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. If the hedge item 
is a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from 
equity and included in the initial amount of the asset or liability. However, loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
that will not be recovered in one or more future periods is reclassified from equity into profit or loss. 
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the hedge is no longer highly effective, the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the hedge 
designation is revoked. If the hedge is for a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,  
any related cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income on the hedging instrument is reclassified 
from equity into profit or loss.
A financial liability or a part of it is derecognised when, and only when, the obligation specified in the contract is discharged 
or cancelled or expired. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial 
liability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred 
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group and the Company adopt the indirect method in the preparation of the statements of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances, deposits placed with licensed banks and short-term highly 
liquid investments which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the statements of cash 
flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts, cash held in trust for customers and deposits held 
in trust account.
Provisions
Provisions are made when the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable 
estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. Provisions are measured at the Group’s and the Company’s best 
estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, and are discounted to present 
value where the effect is material.
At the end of the reporting period, provisions are reviewed and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Provisions are 
reversed if it is no longer probable that the Group and the Company will be required to settle the obligation.

4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
Critical judgement in applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, management 
is of the opinion that there are no instances of application of judgement which are expected to have a significant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation 
uncertainty at the end of each reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year other than as follows:
(i) Impairment loss on financing receivables (Note 11) 
The expected credit loss for measurement of impairment losses under MFRS 9 requires judgement. The impairment 
losses computed based on ECL models are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions 
regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. A number of significant judgements are also 
required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring impairment losses, such as determining criteria for 
significant increase in credit risk, choosing the appropriate models, determining the suitability of forward-looking 
information and the number of probability weighting outcome scenarios. 
As the current MFRS 9 models are not expected to generate levels of ECL with sufficient reliability in light of  
prevalent uncertainties pertaining to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, management judgement and overlays 
have been applied to determine an adequate overall level of ECL for the financial year ended 28 February 2022.  
These overlays took into consideration the latest macroeconomic outlook not captured in the modelled outcome and 
the potential impact to delinquencies and defaults when the various relief and support measures offered to customers. 
The overlays involved a significant level of judgement and reflect the management’s views of possible effects of the 
pandemic and paths of recovery in the forward-looking assessment for ECL estimation purposes.
Customers who have received repayment supports remain in their existing delinquency stages unless they have been 
individually identified as not viable or with subsequent indicators of significant increase in credit risk from each of their 
pre-COVID-19 status. The impact of these overlays, which are estimated at portfolio level and remained outside the 
core MFRS 9 process, are amounting to RM118,149,000 (2021: RM59,942,000) of the Group’s and of the Company’s  
ECL on financing receivables for the financial year. 
(ii) Deferred tax assets (Note 10) 
The Group and the Company assess at the end of the reporting period whether there is probable and sufficient 
future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Significant 
management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised,  
based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.
(iii) Fair value estimation of financial instruments (Note 8 and Note 14)
The fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value is determined using a variety of valuation techniques.  
The Group and the Company generally use widely recognised valuation models with market observable inputs, 
judgement is required where market observable data are not available. Such judgement normally incorporate 
assumptions that other market participants would use in their valuations, including assumptions about interest rate 
yield curves, exchange rates, volatilities, discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections.

32. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The principal activity of the Company is the provision of easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes based  
on Islamic principles and payment cards business, all of which are categorised under consumer financing business.  
The contribution from the newly acquired subsidiary company which is principally engaged in the insurance brokering 
business remains insignificant to the Group during the financial year. 
On this basis, the Managing Director (“MD”) reviews the business performance of the Group as a whole. 
Accordingly, the segmental reporting used is equivalent to the presentation reflected in the Statements of Financial Position 
and Statements of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.

The main risks and corresponding management policies arising from the Group’s and the Company’s normal course of 
business are as follows:
(i) Financial risk management objectives and policies
Risk management forms an integral part of the Group’s and of the Company’s activities and remains an important 
feature in all its business, operations, delivery channels and decision making processes. The extent to which the Group 
and the Company are able to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report each of the various types of risk is critical 
to its strength, soundness and profitability. The Group’s and the Company’s risk management function is independent 
of its operating units. All new businesses, introduction of new products, engagement in new activities or entry into 
new strategic alliances are subject to review by the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) and Board Risk Committee 
(“BRC”) prior to Board of Directors (“the Board”) approval.
The objectives of the Group’s and of the Company’s risk management activities are to:
•	 Identify	and	monitor	the	various	risk	exposure	and	risk	requirements;
•	 Ensure	high	risk	activities	are	in	accordance	with	the	approved	policies	and	the	aggregate	risk	position	is	within	the	
risk level approved by the Board; and
•	 Help	to	create	shareholders	value	through	proper	allocation	and	management	of	risk,	and	facilitate	the	risk	
assessment of new business and products independently.

34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(ii) Risk management framework
The Group and the Company employ an Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework (“ERMF”) to manage its risks 
effectively. The framework involves on-going process of identifying, evaluating, monitoring, managing and reporting 
significant risks affecting the Group and the Company through the RMC and subsequently to BRC and Board.  
This framework provides the Board and management with a tool to anticipate and manage both existing and potential 
risks, taking into consideration the dynamic risk profiles, as dictated by changes in business strategies, regulatory 
environment and functional activities throughout the year.
(iii) Risk organisation and reporting
The responsibility of risk management lies with the Board. In line with best practices, the Board determines the risk 
policy objectives for the Group and the Company, and assumes responsibility for the supervision of risk management. 
To this end, the Board is assisted by BRC to provide primary oversight responsibilities on the Group’s and the Company’s 
risk management.
The day-to-day responsibility for risk management and control is delegated to the RMC which undertakes the oversight 
function for overall risk limit and ensures that the Group and the Company are within the risk appetite as established 
by the Board. The RMC also deliberates the implementation of the ERMF which addresses credit, market, operational 
and strategic risks within the policies established by the respective business units and recommending policy changes 
to BRC for review, and subsequently to the Board for approval.
Risk exposures, impact and mitigation measures which cover all areas of risk faced by the Group and the Company 
are reviewed and updated regularly to BRC and the Board to ensure relevance and compliance with current and 
applicable laws and regulations.
The Group and the Company have exposure to the following significant risks in the course of undertaking its ordinary 
business activities:
(a) Credit risk
(b) Liquidity risk
(c) Market risk
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company due to the deterioration in credit worthiness 
of its borrowers and consequently, their ability to discharge their contractual obligations to the Group and the 
Company. Credit risk remains the most significant risk to which the Group and the Company are exposed.  
The purpose of credit risk management is to manage or maintain credit risk exposure at an acceptable level,  
in line with the Group’s and the Company’s risk appetite and to ensure that the returns commensurate to the risk 
taken.
The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arises principally from its financing to customers, cash, 
bank balances and deposits, other receivables and amount owing by related companies.
Receivables
(i) Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group and the Company have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an 
ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit and the credit acceptance 
procedures are monitored by the management. Collateral is required for the business of financing vehicles, 
equipment and machineries. Other than this, the Group and the Company do not require collateral in respect 
of the easy payment schemes, personal financing schemes and credit cards issuance business. 
The Group and the Company conduct regular monitoring on credit exposure trend and portfolio concentration 
analysis. Asset quality is closely monitored so that deteriorating exposure are identified, analysed and 
reviewed with relevant business units.

(iii) Risk organisation and reporting (continued)
(a) Credit risk (continued)
Receivables (continued)
(ii) Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
At end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company do not have any significant exposure to any 
individual customers or industry sector. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying 
amount of each financial asset.
The Group and the Company do not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover its credit 
risks associated with its financial assets, except that the credit risk associated with hire purchase financing 
receivables is mitigated because they are secured over the vehicles, equipment and machineries of 
customers. The carrying amount of hire purchase financing receivables amounts to RM5,731,859,000  
(2021: RM5,940,014,000). There has not been any significant change in the quality of the collateral held for 
hire purchase financing. The Group and the Company recognise a loss allowance for these hire purchase 
financing receivables based on the ECL model of the Group and of the Company.
(iii) Credit risk reporting and monitoring
The Group’s and the Company’s credit portfolios are monitored through monthly and/or adhoc reporting to 
ensure credit deterioration is promptly detected and mitigated through implementation of risk remediation 
strategies. Credit Policy and Review Department undertakes regular and comprehensive analysis of credit 
portfolios and reports to the RMC on emerging credit issues.
(iv) Credit risk mitigation
All credit facilities are granted on the credit standing of the borrower, source of repayment, debt servicing 
ability and the collateral pledged. Personal guarantees are obtained when the borrower’s credit worthiness is 
insufficient to justify granting facilities.
(v) Concentration risk
Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or 
activities within the same geographic region, or when they have similar risk characteristics that would cause 
their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. 
The Group and the Company monitor various portfolios to identify and assess risk concentrations. The credit 
portfolios are monitored and reviewed to identify, assess and guard against unacceptable risk concentrations.

(a) Credit risk (continued)
Credit quality and allowance for impairment losses (continued)
Renegotiated/restructured activities include extended payment arrangements, and the modification and deferral 
of payments. The Group and the Company have recognised allowance for impairment loss of RM101,553,000 
(2021: RM144,106,000) for these renegotiated/restructured financing receivables. The status of net renegotiated/
restructured receivables are as follows:

Past due more than 90 days 4,395 4,395 2,885
  146,276 146,276 149,844
Cash, bank balances and deposits
The cash, bank balances and deposits are placed only with reputable licensed banks and financial institutions and 
have low credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by government agencies. Consequently,  
the Group and the Company are of the view that the risk of loss for this category of financial instrument is low,  
and no loss allowance is provided. 
Other receivables
Credit risks on other receivables are mainly arising from sundry receivables. As at the end of the reporting period, 
the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial 
position. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company do not consider it necessary to recognise 
any allowance for impairment losses.
Amount owing by related companies
The Group and the Company provide unsecured advances to related companies. The Group and the Company 
monitor the ability of the related companies to repay the advances on an individual basis. As at the end of the 
reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statement 
of financial position. Generally, the Group and the Company consider balances with related companies as having 
low credit risk. At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company did not recognise any allowance 
for impairment losses.
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they 
fall due. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables and 
borrowings.
The Group’s and the Company’s liquidity risk management practice is to maintain high quality and well diversified 
portfolios of liquid assets and source of funds under both normal business and stressed conditions. The Group 
and the Company maintain optimum ratio of long term funding, i.e. debts maturing after 12 months from the end of 
the reporting period against total debts. This ratio significantly matches the ratio of long term financing receivables 
determined based on customers’ contracted terms of repayment and payment pattern for revolving credit limits 
granted.

(iii) Risk organisation and reporting (continued)
(b) Liquidity risk (continued)
The Treasury unit reviews the asset and liability maturity profile and identifies any maturity mismatch for escalation 
to the RMC which is responsible for the independent monitoring of the Group’s and of the Company’s liquidity 
risk profile. The RMC meets every month to discuss the liquidity risk and funding profile of the Group and of the 
Company and works closely with the Treasury unit on the surveillance of market conditions and stress testing 
analysis on liquidity positions. The Group maintains sufficient credit lines to ensure that all current obligations are 
able to be met. As at 28 February 2022, the Group and the Company have unutilised lines of credit amounting to 
RM4,488,000,000 (2021: RM4,713,000,000) obtained from licensed banks and financial institutions.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk of potential loss as a result of changes in the intrinsic value of financial instruments caused by 
movement in market variables such as interest rate/profit rate, currency exchange rates, equity pricing and other 
related macro-economic factors that will eventually affect the Group’s and the Company’s profitability, cash flows 
and capital preservation.
The Group’s and the Company’s market risk management includes the monitoring of the fluctuations in net interest 
income/profit revenue or investment value due to changes in relevant risk factors. RMC monitors the exposure on 
monthly basis through reports and analysis with the support of the Treasury unit.
In managing interest income/profit revenue rate, the Group and the Company intend to maximise net interest 
income/profit revenue; and to minimise the significant volatility in relation to the Group’s and the Company’s assets 
and liabilities.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s and the Company’s fixed rate borrowings and derivatives are exposed to a risk of change in their fair 
value due to changes in the interest income/profit revenue rates. The Group’s and the Company’s variable rate 
borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. The other financial 
assets and liabilities are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group and the Company borrow for their operations at fixed and variable rates and monitors the interest rate 
exposure by assessing the interest rate gap of interest bearing financial assets and financial liabilities. The Group 
and the Company also use cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate risk on bank borrowings 
as stated in hedging activities below. The management continuously seeks for alternative banking facilities,  
which provide competitive interest rates to finance its capital expenditure, financing and working capital 
requirements.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
(a) Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss and the Group and the Company designate derivatives as hedging instruments under 
the cash flow hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting period 
would not affect profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A change of 100 basis points (bps) in interest rates at the end of the reporting period would have increased/
(decreased) equity and pre-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other 
variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remained constant.

Hedging activities
Cash flow hedge
The Group and the Company have entered into cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash 
flow risk in relation to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of RM3,401,860,000 (2021: RM3,674,492,000). 
The cross currency interest rate swaps have the same notional value of RM3,401,860,000 (2021: RM3,674,492,000) 
and are to be settled in full upon maturity, on terms matching the hedged items.
The following table indicates the years in which the cash flows associated with the derivative financial assets 
with carrying amount is RM26,057,000 (2021: RMNil) and derivative financial liabilities of RM69,655,000 
(2021: RM281,903,000) that are expected to occur and affect profit or loss.

Currency risk
The Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk mainly on borrowings that are denominated in 
a currency other than the functional currency of the Group and of the Company. The currency which gives rise to 
this risk is primarily USD and JPY. 
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk 
The repayment of all borrowings in foreign currencies is fully hedged by cross currency interest rate swaps entered 
into by the Group and the Company upon initial drawdown of the borrowings.

The methods and assumptions used by management to determine the fair values of the financial instruments are as follows:
(i) Financing receivables
The fair value of financing receivables with remaining maturity of less than one year are estimated to approximate 
their carrying amounts. For financing receivables with remaining maturity of more than one year, the fair values are 
estimated based on discounted cash flows using prevailing rates of loans and receivables of similar credit profile.

35. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(ii) Term loans/financing
The fair value of term loans/financing with remaining maturity of less than one year are estimated to approximate their 
carrying amounts. For term loans/financing with remaining maturity of more than one year, the fair values are estimated 
using discounting technique. The discount rates are based on market rates available to the Group and the Company 
for similar instruments.
(iii) Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of cross currency swap derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group and the Company would 
receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the end of reporting period and is determined based on discounted future 
cash flows. Future cash flows are estimated based on forward interest rates (from observable yield curves at the end of 
the reporting period), forward exchange rates (from observable forward exchange rates at the end of reporting period), 
contract interest rates and contract forward rates, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.
(iv) Other investments
The fair value of other investments is based on the expected cash flows discounted as at reporting date. The discounted 
cash flow method was used to capture the present value of the expected future economic benefits to be derived from 
the ownership of these investees. The key inputs are discount rate, terminal growth rate and discount for lack of 
control, as described in this Note. 
(v) Other financial instruments
The fair value of other instruments are determined to approximate to its carrying value due to the short term nature of 
these financial instruments. 
The fair value hierarchies used to classify financial instruments not measured at fair value in the statements of financial 
position, but for which fair value is disclosed, are as follows:
(i) Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(ii) Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  
either directly (i.e. prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
(iii) Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The following table shows a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for fair value 
measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:

AEON CREDIT SERVICE (M) BERHAD
integrated annual report 2022

EXPLANATORY NOTES 
(i) Item 1 of the Agenda - To receive the Audited Financial Statements 
Agenda item 1 is meant for discussion only as the provision of Section 340(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2016 does not require a formal approval 
of shareholders for the Audited Financial Statements. Hence, this item on the Agenda is not put forward for voting.
(ii) Ordinary Resolution 3 - To approve the payment of Benefits Payable to the Chairman/Non-Independent Non-Executive Director up to 
an aggregate amount of RM31,150 from 30 June 2022 until the next AGM of the Company in year 2023
The benefits payable (excluding Directors’ Fees) to Mr Ng Eng Kiat, the Chairman/Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, 
comprises benefits-in-kind (computed in accordance with Lembaga Hasil Dalam Negeri’s guideline) for the use of a company car, driver and 
petrol.
(iii) Ordinary Resolutions 4 to 13 on the Re-election of Directors
The performance of each Director who is recommended for re-election has been assessed through the Board’s annual evaluation.  
The Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors are satisfied with the performance, contribution and effectiveness of the Directors 
who are due for retirement. The retiring Directors being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election at the 25th AGM.
The profiles of the Directors who are standing for re-election under Ordinary Resolutions 4 to 13  are set out in the Board of Directors’ profiles 
of the Integrated Annual Report 2022.
(iv) Ordinary Resolution 15 - Proposed Renewal of Authority under Sections 75 and 76 of the Companies Act 2016 for the Directors to allot 
and issue shares
The Company had, during its Twenty-Fourth AGM held on 23 June 2021, obtained its shareholders’ approval for the general mandate for 
issuance of shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Companies Act 2016. As at the date of this notice, the Company has not issued any 
shares pursuant to that mandate obtained. 
The Ordinary Resolution 15 proposed under item 8 of the Agenda is a renewal of the general mandate for issuance of shares by the 
Company under Sections 75 and 76 of Companies Act 2016. The resolution, if passed, will provide flexibility for the Company and empower 
the Directors to allot and issue new shares speedily in the Company up to an amount not exceeding in total ten per centum (10%) of the 
issued shares of the Company for such purposes as the Directors consider would be in the interest of the Company. This would eliminate 
any delay arising from and cost involved in convening a general meeting to obtain approval of the shareholders for such issuance of shares.  
This authority, unless revoked or varied by the Company at a general meeting, will expire at the next AGM of the Company.
This authority will provide flexibility to the Company for any possible fund raising activities, including but not limited to further placing of 
shares for purpose of funding investment project(s), working capital and/or acquisition(s). 
(v) Ordinary Resolution 16 - Proposed Shareholders’ Mandate
Ordinary Resolution 16 proposed under item 9 of the Agenda, if passed, will allow the Company to enter into recurrent related party 
transactions in accordance with paragraph 10.09 of the MMLR of Bursa Securities and without the necessity to convene separate general 
meetings from time to time to seek shareholders’ approval as and when such recurrent related party transactions occur. This would reduce 
substantial administrative time and expenses associated with the convening of such meetings without compromising the corporate objectives 
of the Company or affecting the business opportunities available to the Company. The shareholders’ mandate is subject to renewal on an 
annual basis.
Further information on the Proposed Shareholders’ Mandate is set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 26 May 2022.
