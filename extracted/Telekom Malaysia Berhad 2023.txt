 See page 45
Stakeholder Engagement: What do our stakeholders need?
Our long-term growth relies on the ongoing trust and support of our stakeholders. Thus, we 
regularly engage with our stakeholders to understand and address their diverse needs, 
spanning both financial and non-financial aspects.

invest in to drive our strategic purpose forward, 
serves as our execution engine, embodying our 
commitment to excellence.

continuously strengthen our value proposition and 
competitive edge by embracing new technologies 
and digital solutions.
 Nat ural Capital
Our operations, dependent on various resources 
such as energy, water, radio spectrum and other 
natural resources, are committed to reducing the 
environmental impact of our activities as we 
advance on our sustainability journey.

not only enable us to fulfil our nation building 
agenda but also foster bonds that contribute to 
building a resilient and thriving society.
 M anufactured Capital

Dear Stakeholders,
Stepping into my role as Chairman of TM in 2023, I am both inspired and invigorated by the dynamic 
technological and digital evolution that surrounds us. Our aspiration is clear – to be a world-class company 
distinguished by our commitment to ‘Service Excellence’ and ‘Product Excellence.’ Our pursuit of excellence is 
rooted in our 78-year legacy of innovation, and our resolve towards advancing the Digital Malaysia agenda, 
unlocking the benefits of connectivity for Malaysians across all walks of life. This will bring new opportunities 
for greater economic growth for Malaysia through enhanced digital adoption.
As the new Chairman, I am excited to steer the Group through the next transformative phase, where our proud past informs a brighter 
future. TM has the most comprehensive digital ecosystem in Malaysia, and the work we undertake creates value that directly improves 
the lives of all our stakeholders. We recognise this immense responsibility and are committed to upholding it with dedication and 
capability. With this in mind, I am pleased to share our strategic insights and direction for 2023.
A WORLD OF CHANGE
2023 was a period of profound change and complexities. Stepping 
out of the shadow of the pandemic, the world has witnessed 
geopolitical tensions, impacts from extreme weather events, 
increased costs of living, escalating inflation, as well as an urgent 
need for enhanced digital literacy. Against this backdrop, Malaysia 
has showcased its commendable resilience and proactive 
adaptation. The national economy normalised to 3.7% GDP growth 
in 2023, propelled by strong domestic demand and stable 
employment.
Sustainability has also become a central theme amongst Malaysian 
businesses. In light of climate change concerns, the Government 
has embraced a comprehensive approach to environmental 
stewardship and societal well-being which embodies an increasing 
acknowledgement of the interconnectedness of economic growth, 
social equity and environmental preservation.
UNLOCKING MALAYSIA’S DIGITAL POTENTIAL
At TM, we are closely aligned with the Government’s vision of 
creating a Digital Malaysia through our multifaceted approach of 
inclusiveness. This comprises its expanded coverage and services 
through fiberisation, 5G, data centres and global connectivity via 
our extensive submarine cable network. 
Through these solutions, we have been able to enhance reach and 
efficiency through our connectivity services, elevate the quality of 
our converged fixed and mobile services and contribute significantly 
to the broader goal of advancing Malaysia’s digital landscape. It 
provides us with the opportunities to bring immersive experiences 
to local communities and showcase how technology can elevate 
their daily lives – be it in work, education or entertainment, while 
empowering the creation, sharing and consumption of digital 
content. 
LEADING WITH PURPOSE
In the wake of a dynamic business landscape, the need for strong, 
insightful leadership has become more pressing than ever. This 
year, our Board has been deeply focused on enhancing TM’s 
governance, upholding accountability and transparency across our 
operations.

As the leading national  
connectivity and infrastructure 
provider, TM remains at the 
forefront of executing the 
national fiberisation plan while 
spearheading the nationwide  
5G rollout.
DATO’ ZAINAL ABIDIN PUTIH
Chairman
We have a robust governance framework, anchored in the Main Market Listing Requirements (Main LR) of Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad (Bursa Securities), the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2021 and global best practices. The Board of Directors 
maintains its commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance, ensuring every decision and action we take serve the best 
interests of our stakeholders. 
An example of enhancement for our governance structure is the reconstitution of the Board Risk Committee (BRC) as the Board Risk 
and Investment Committee (BRIC), effective from 1 January 2024. This expansion broadens BRIC’s remit to encompass a comprehensive 
approach to sustainability and investment, reflecting the changing priorities in the current business climate.
To future-proof our leadership, we invested in improving the Board’s knowledge and expertise. Comprehensive Board training programmes 
have been instrumental in the development of our Board members covering a wide array of topics, including Business Sustainability, 
Performance and Risk Management, equipping us to navigate the changing realms of climate change and digital transformation.

ENGAGING FOR IMPACT
At the core of TM’s ethos is the continuous value creation to 
stakeholders. Our vision as a forward-thinking technology company 
is to shape a Digital Malaysia through technology that empowers 
communities, businesses and Government.
In partnership with the Government, we supported key initiatives 
like Jalinan Digital Negara (JENDELA) and MyDigital to close the 
gap on the digital divide and transform Malaysia into a high-
income digital nation. We also accelerated the nation’s digital 
aspirations by offering holistic and agnostic connectivity, platform 
and digital solutions. 
At the same time, we empower our customers through our world-
class digital services. Our efforts focus on enhancing customer 
experiences through consistent, always-on services. We are a 
leader in connectivity, bringing valuable services and self-serve 
digital platforms to our customers.
For Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise (MSME) customers, TM is 
a catalyst for digitalisation, contributing to their growth and 
success. Overall, in 2023, we enabled approximately 400,000 
MSMEs, significantly boosting the digital economy.
Our employees are the backbone of our success. We cultivate a 
diverse and inclusive workplace, prioritising their well-being and 
professional development. Flexible work arrangements combined 
with the deployment of digital tools, optimise productivity and job 
satisfaction. We invest continually in our employees, enhancing 
their skills and capabilities to remain competitive and future-ready.
TM’s role in societal development can be seen through our 
initiatives with Yayasan Telekom Malaysia (YTM). Our programmes, 
like the flagship YTM Scholarship, Structured Development 
Programme and TM Future Skills Programme, positively impacted 
over 9,000 individuals. Our efforts in community and nation 
building have reached over 110,000 individuals, focusing on digital 
skills training, disaster relief and charitable initiatives, all aimed at 
enriching and uplifting local communities. 
In terms of shareholder value, our approach is to maximise long-
term returns. We consider various factors such as business 
performance, capital commitments and financial conditions to 
ensure sustainable value creation. For 2023, we will be sharing our 
profits with shareholders a total dividend of 25 sen per share or 
approximately RM957.9 million, marking the highest dividend 
announced since 2008. 
In every aspect of the Board’s deliberation, we remain steadfast in 
our commitment to delivering value that transcends conventional 
business metrics, contributing to a more connected, empowered 
and sustainable Malaysia.
A LEADER IN SUSTAINABILITY
This year, we made progress in our sustainability journey. We 
enhanced our Sustainability Framework with two key objectives of 
enabling sustainable growth and ensuring business resilience. 
These are closely aligned with UN’s Sustainable Development 
Goals, SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG17 
(Partnerships for the Goals). 
We achieved a key milestone in our sustainability governance 
through the release of our first Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, well ahead of Bursa Malaysia’s 
2025 requirement, enhancing our transparency around climate-
related risks and opportunities. I’m also pleased to report our 
progress in reducing carbon emissions by 22% against the 2019 
baseline. Our main focus has been in driving energy efficiency 
across TM’s network and data centres. This is a significant step 
in our journey towards a low-carbon future.
We have identified our supply chain as a good opportunity for 
sustainability impact. In November, we introduced a Sustainable 
Supply Chain Roadmap, underlining the importance of partnering 
with suppliers committed to sustainable practices.
In light of our achievements, we secured a 46-point rating in  
the S&P Global ESG Score, making TM one of the top telcos for 
sustainability in the region.
VISION FOR TOMORROW
Stepping into 2024, TM is poised to grow its business in anticipation 
of a year filled with exciting challenges coupled with great 
opportunities. Set against the promising forecast of Malaysia’s 
economy projected to grow between 4% and 5%, this upturn 
reflects a landscape ready for innovation and progress.
Central to this outlook is the Malaysian Budget 2024, where the 
Government has earmarked substantial investments for digital 
advancement and automation. Besides the 5G Cyber Security 
Testing Framework allocation, a RM900.0 million loan fund was 
made available to support MSMEs, dedicated to boosting business 
productivity through automation and digitisation. 
As the leading national connectivity and digital infrastructure 
provider, TM remains at the forefront of executing the national 
fiberisation plan while spearheading the nationwide 5G rollout. Our 
active role in 5G implementation, backed by our nationwide fibre 
infrastructure, digital platforms and wealth of experience, is poised 
to drive significant advancements.
Our current endeavors in AI, which range from enriching customer 
experiences to optimising operational processes, will be further 
accelerated. We aim to harness the power of technology to 
improve lives and businesses through smarter solutions. These 
include predictive analytics and enhanced customer experiences, 
thereby strengthening our leadership in digital innovation.
Our optimism is fuelled by the prospects of increased hyperconnectivity 
and digitalisation across all customer segments, as we navigate 
the future effectively, capitalising on emerging opportunities while 
striving for growth in all areas of our business.
For 2023, we will be sharing our  
profits with shareholders a total 
dividend of 25 sen per share or 
approximately RM957.9 million, 
marking the highest dividend 
announced since 2008.

Dear Stakeholders,
I am pleased to present my first 
message as the Managing Director/
Group CEO. The year 2023 marked 
the successful completion of our 
Transformation Plan, a period that 
symbolised our evolution from a 
traditional telecommunications

digitalisation.

THE DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE OF 2023
2023 was challenging with competitive pressures and economic strains largely due to 
slower global trade, geopolitical concerns and rising interest rates. This resulted in the 
moderated economic growth of 3.7% in Malaysia. Subsequently, the market saw volatility 
in foreign exchange rates, requiring further stringent financial management to ensure the 
sustainability of our global investments and partnerships.
At the same time, sustainability emerged as a critical global and local theme, with Malaysia 
adopting a more holistic approach emphasising green growth, renewable energy, 
conservation, sustainable transportation and social inclusivity. In the regulatory domain, we 
remained aligned with the Government’s policies that were geared towards affordability 
and inclusion.
Amid these challenges, TM demonstrated financial resilience and operational robustness 
by striking a balance between investing in new technologies and maximising the value of 
our existing assets. In light of intensified competition in the market, we re-envisioned our 
service offerings, incorporating differentiated digital and lifestyle solutions that are 
attractive to our customers, thereby leading to greater vibrancy in the market. 
CHARTING THE PATH: STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE
Following our transformative three-year journey from 2021 to 2023, we now embark on the 
next level of our transformation journey, aiming to become a Digital Powerhouse by 2030. 
This ambition is designed not only to elevate our own trajectory but to also position 
Malaysia as a digital hub for the region, setting the stage for our long-term success. 
The journey has been characterised by significant milestones, including the strategic and 
operational challenges and opportunities that 2023 presented. TM has continued to 
strengthen our position as a leader in the converged communications landscape, enhancing 
operational excellence and elevating customer service.
Our performance in 2023 demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and 
financial resilience. TM recorded a 1.1% increase in revenue, reaching RM12.26 billion, up 
from RM12.12 billion in 2022. This performance has also positively impacted our Total 
Shareholders Return (TSR) at 6.33%, reaffirming our commitment to delivering shareholder 
value. 
AMAR HUZAIMI MD DERIS
Managing Director/
Group Chief Executive Officer
We now embark on the next level 
of our transformation journey, 
aiming to become a Digital 
Powerhouse by 2030. This 
ambition is designed not only to 
elevate our own trajectory but to 
also position Malaysia as a digital 
hub for the region, setting the 
stage for our long-term success.
Going beyond technological advancements, TM 
is focused on unleashing the potential inherent 
in our people, customers, communities and 
nation. Our goal is clear: to ensure that the 
benefits of digitalisation are widespread and 
equitable, fostering a society where every 
contribution is valued and every opportunity 
leveraged on.
Following our progress, we are entering the 
next phase of our transformation, with the goal 
towards establishing ourselves as a Digital 
Powerhouse by 2030. This evolution is 
imperative to harness the transformative power 
of digital technology, ensuring our agility in 
adapting to the ever-evolving landscape and 
contributing to a brighter future for Malaysians.

market complexities while exploring 
new growth opportunities. Despite a 
decrease in revenue, its Q4 2023

strategic convergence campaigns 
and customer retention efforts.
POSITIONING MALAYSIA 
AS ASEAN’S DIGITAL 
HUB
TM Global revenue rose 8.7% to 
RM3.10 billion, primarily from an 
increase in international data 
revenue, driven by managed 
wavelength services for

Our growth is reflected by the strong performance across our customer-facing business units:
Our unique convergence solutions have solidified our position as the only Fixed-Mobile Convergence (FMC) with quad-play in Malaysia.

the latest in 5G, mobility, smart solutions, cloud, data centres, edge nodes, cyber security, IoT, AI and more.
Our extensive fibre network that spans across 720,000 km nationwide has been fundamental in supporting the rapid deployment of 5G

GENERATING 
SUSTAINABLE
VALUE
Our performance in 
2023 demonstrates the 
effectiveness of our 
strategic initiatives and 
financial resilience. TM 
recorded a 1.1% increase 
in revenue, reaching 
RM12.26 billion, up from 
RM12.12 billion in 2022
Evidently, TM’s efforts have progressively contributed towards building 
a strong foundation of digital infrastructure for the nation. This aligns 
with our aspiration to become a Digital Powerhouse by 2030 while 
positioning Malaysia as a digital hub for the region. Guided by this 
aspiration, we strive to empower progress that is inclusive, leveraging 
the full potential of all stakeholders to shape a digitally empowered 
nation.
To achieve these goals, we are guided by our PWR 2030 aspiration 
which is defined by three (3) key pillars as follows:
PIONEER
We aim to lead industry growth through digitalisation and 
sustainability by exploring and developing new technologies and 
opportunities. 
WIN
We will focus on leading the charge in critical areas such as 
government, business and society, establishing ourselves as the 
go-to provider for cutting-edge digital infrastructure and services 
such as 5G.
REVITALISE
We will foster a vibrant ecosystem of talent and innovation, for 
Malaysia and the region. By harnessing creativity and supporting 
entrepreneurs and innovators, we aim to position Malaysia as a 
hub for digital and technological innovation.
As the largest digital communications network infrastructure operating 
in Malaysia, we will continue to evolve our network to become the 
foundation of a thriving digital ecosystem and to develop a unified 
platform in enabling digital services.
ELEVATING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
TM is committed to a customer-first philosophy. Our Customer 
Experience (CX) team has adopted a structured approach to enhancing 
customer experiences, aiming to create seamless and positive 
experiences through a personalised customer approach.
To achieve this, our approach focuses on three (3) core pillars: 
Personalisation, Seamlessness and Digitalisation. Our Personalisation 
feature enables our customers to choose TM’s services and interactions 
that best suit their individual needs, whether it is to connect at home, 
work or on-the-go. Seamlessness is aimed at delivering a smooth 
customer journey across all our touchpoints, while Digitalisation 
leverages on our technologies to improve service accessibility for all 
our customers.
An example of how we digitalise our CX is by enabling various easy-
to-use self-diagnostic tools for our customers. This has resulted in a 
significant reduction of customer complaints by 33.3% and a 5.4% 
decrease in service requests faults since 2022.

Moreover, our key Unifi stores within Klang Valley were redesigned 
and enhanced, leading to a streamlined in-store digital journey, 
with dedicated MSME areas and improved overall satisfaction with 
TM’s services. 
Reflecting the outcome of all the initiatives by the CX team, TM’s 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) rose from 23 in 2021 to 46 in 2023, 
highlighting our successes in enhancing the overall customer 
experience journey while continuing our momentum to drive 
convergence benefits to all.
EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE
We fondly refer to our employees as Warga TM, recognising them 
as the execution engine of our company. As such, we are 
dedicated to cultivating a workplace environment that fosters 
growth and fulfilment. Our holistic approach encompasses fair 
policies, competitive benefits, career advancements and a culture 
of respect and care, to ensure all team members feel engaged, 
empowered and valued.
 
To foster equity, drive innovation and ensure sustainability, TM 
maintains a diverse and inclusive leadership team. In 2023, we 
achieved 32% female representation in senior management, 
surpassing our target of 30%. We also championed equal 
opportunity with policies and practices that reject discrimination 
based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, disability or any 
other protected characteristics.
The well-being of our employees remains paramount, reflected in 
our flexible work arrangements as well as our comprehensive 
Wellbeing360 programme which safeguards the health and 
motivation of our employees. Multiple platforms of digital learning 
opportunities and resources are made accessible, to induce 
continuous on-demand learning for various up-to-date topics. 
Our commitment to ensuring fairness, respect and care has 
strengthened our brand as the employer of choice. This is evident 
by the accolades we have earned, including Asia’s Best Employer 
Brand Award 2023 from the Employer Branding Institute and 
World HRD Congress, Platinum Award in the Communication 
Networks at the Putra Brand Awards 2023 and the Best Companies 
to Work for in Asia 2023 (Gold Award) from HR Asia Magazine, 
marking our fifth consecutive win. These awards underscore our 
position as the preferred choice for top talent and for creating an 
environment where employees thrive.
Moving forward, TM’s transformation into a Digital Powerhouse 
will be reliant on the effort we place on future-proofing our 
workforce. This includes ensuring they are digitally conversant and 
competent, ready to lead in the evolving digital landscape and to 
deliver TM’s strategies. We are committed to extensive training 
and development programmes, to equip our team with future 
skills, leadership capabilities, current business skills and the right 
mindset and culture.
SUSTAINABILITY: OUR CORE PHILOSOPHY 
2023 was a transformative year in TM’s sustainability journey, 
catalysed by the expansion of our sustainability endeavours that 
resulted in a refined Sustainability Framework and Integration Plan, 
rooted in TM’s vision, mission and PWR 2030 aspiration.
This new Sustainability Framework is aimed at achieving two (2) 
strategic objectives: enabling sustainable growth for its customers 
and the community, and ensuring business resilience within TM 
and across our value chain. These objectives are supported by five 
(5) key pillars of sustainability.
In our first pillar as a Solutions Provider, TM harnesses innovative 
and technology-based solutions that provide sustainability value 
and superior customer experiences, alongside a stable and high 
quality network. The second pillar is Digital Inclusion, where we 
seek to narrow the digital divide and foster digital inclusion, 
enabling widespread connectivity access and digital technology 
benefits.
The next pillar is Environmental Management. This is where we 
actively manage impacts and resource use through mitigation and 
adaptation strategies, enhancing resilience to environmental and 
climate-related challenges. Fourth, as a Responsible Employer, TM 
prioritises its Warga TM’s professional growth and personal well-
being, nurturing an ethical and safe workplace culture that 
supports their development. The last pillar is Ethical Business, 
where we establish trust through ethical business practices, 
covering a sustainable supply chain, cyber security, data privacy 
and responsible communication to foster long-term relationships 
with stakeholders.
Our purpose-driven approach to sustainability to date has garnered 
recognition and set new ESG benchmarks within the industry. With 
an S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) rating 
of 46 points, TM is among the top-rated telcos in the region for 
sustainability, a testament to our unwavering commitment to 
integrating sustainability into every aspect of our business, from 
governance to operations and community engagement.
Advancing into 2024, TM will continue 
to pursue its focus on modernising, 
and expanding its significant network 
infrastructure and operations, while 
enhancing our core capabilities as well 
as driving digitalisation, innovation and 
sustainability.

driving digitalisation, innovation and sustainability.
With TM’s PWR 2030 blueprint clearly guiding our vision, we will

seamless and digitalised experiences. At the same time, Warga TM 
remains as our core valuable resource and we will continue to 
emphasise our employees’ well-being through various upskilling 
programmes, preparing robust and adept digital talents. This is in 
line with our ultimate goal – towards becoming a world-class 
organisation.
Our refined Sustainability Framework will be a game changer for 
us as we accelerate the process of embedding sustainability into 
every facet of our operations. This includes the sustainable ways

the long term in a purposeful and ethical way. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT & APPRECIATION

Dear Stakeholders,
2023 was a challenging year 
for TM, with regulatory 
shifts, increased competitive 
pressures and evolving 
market dynamics 
significantly shaping our 
industry. In the face of rising 
technology costs and 
regulatory developments, we 
remained vigilant and aware 
of the potential economic 
headwinds that could 
restrain market expansion 
and impact spending across 
our consumer, enterprise, 
public sector and wholesale 
businesses. 
We remained agile, seizing 
opportunities and adapting our 
strategies to navigate the year 
successfully. We achieved sustained 
revenue growth exceeding the revenue 
guidance for the financial year and 
continued to optimise expenditures, 
resulting in a higher than market 
guidance EBIT. Our PATAMI improved 
significantly from the previous year, 
highlighting TM’s resilience
and positive performance in 2023.
RAZIDAN GHAZALLI
Group Chief Financial Officer 
2023 PRIORITIES
We started the year by adopting a conservative yet strategic 
financial approach, anticipating a competitive environment and 
potential market volatility. Our carefully formulated financial 
guidance demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of 
external influences and their impact on our business.
We projected a revenue trajectory consistent with the previous 
year, mindful of further regulatory adjustments in our industry. 
Our Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) were forecasted 
at RM1.8 billion to RM2.0 billion, reflecting our resolve to sustain 
operational efficiency in the face of expected hurdles. We 
allocated a capital expenditure (Capex) budget of 18% to 20% of 
our revenue, affirming our commitment to optimise strategic 
investments that strengthen our network infrastructure and 
support our long-term objectives.

Performance
PROGRESS AND HIGHLIGHTS IN 2023
We are pleased to report that our revenue for 2023 reached RM12.26 billion, registering 
a 1.1% increase from RM12.12 billion in 2022. This rise was primarily driven by the 
performance of TM Global and Unifi which mitigated the challenges encountered by  
TM One. The heightened demand for digital connectivity and broadband services was 
in line with the anticipated growth of these sectors.
EBIT remained flat at RM2.09 billion mainly due to the slight increase in operational 
costs during the year. We have focused on allocating more resources to upgrade our 
systems to elevate our convergence proposition, enhance customer experience, 
improve go-to-market speeds and all supporting retail ecosystems. Our fixed and 
mobile networks are now fully integrated which required spending on some 
harmonisation costs. 
Nevertheless, stringent cost management continues to be our key priority. We have 
various initiatives to unlock more value and drive further cost optimisation. Our 
perseverance for cost efficiency is a critical component in our digital push moving 
forward. Testament to this, our other cost line items for 2023 have improved from the 
previous year. We achieved a further reduction in our operating expenses compared to 
the year before: direct costs decreased by 0.5%, manpower costs were lowered by 2.1% 
and our expenses for Depreciation & Amortisation dropped by 2.3%. This reflects our 
prudent asset management and the fruition of our past cost optimisation initiatives, 
which are now beginning to yield operational efficiencies.
Notably, our PATAMI surged by 63.6%, reaching RM1.87 billion, up from RM1.14 billion 
in 2022. In addition to the stable EBIT, this growth was contributed by the reduction in 
net finance costs by 18.4% due to our proactive debt management and tax credit 
utilisation. This result showcased our financial strength and strategic financial 
management, positioning us well for sustainable progress.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
Unifi recorded a revenue increase 
to RM5.66 billion, supported by 
an expanded subscriber base to 
more than 3.1 million and 
infrastructure enhancements 
enabling higher speed access, in 
line with our commitment to 
delivering exceptional customer 
service.
Despite the revenue drop during 
the year due to market dynamics, 
TM One showed recovery signs 
with a 17.3% revenue increase in 
Q4 2023, driven by solution-based 
and customer projects, setting a 
positive trajectory for future 
performance.
TM Global reported an 8.7% 
revenue increase to RM3.10 billion, 
fuelled by growing data demand 
and strategic infrastructure 
investments, emphasising TM’s 
pivotal role in Malaysia’s digital 
and connectivity advancement.
FINANCIAL STRATEGIES
1. Customer
We actively targeted revenue improvements across all 
customer-facing business units. Unifi strengthened its 
leadership in converged offerings, such as fixed broadband, 
mobile services, digital content and solutions catering to both 
consumers and over 400,000 MSMEs nationally, enhancing 
their digital engagement. 
TM One, recognised as a trusted partner for large enterprises 
and the public sector, provided comprehensive solutions in 
digital connectivity, cyber security and cloud services. TM 
One continues to lead the industry, pioneering innovation and 
entering into various strategic collaborations during the year, 
including private 5G projects, Smart City developments 
utilising predictive artificial intelligence (AI), cloud solutions 
and other digital projects.
Domestically, TM Global has been instrumental in broadening 
5G backhaul sites and High-Speed Broadband Access, 
furthering national digital inclusivity. Internationally, TM Global 
achieved strong year-on-year (YoY) bandwidth growth and 
successfully delivered a mega requirement of leased 
connectivity for US-based hyperscalers. TM Global will 
continue to broaden its digital infrastructure solutions and 
forge strategic alliances with global carriers in positioning 
Malaysia as a key digital hub for the region.
2. Cost
 Optimisation
We prioritised cost optimisation across our operations. 
Strategic investments have been channelled to upgrade 
systems that underpin our convergence strategy, thereby 
augmenting customer experience and expediting operational 
processes. Despite the normalisation of costs in the post-
COVID era affecting various budget lines, TM has exerted 
rigorous control over its spending to ensure business 
resilience in the face of escalating operational expenses.
3. Re
structuring Exercise 
We completed an internal restructuring exercise to improve 
operational efficiencies and streamline operations, a critical 
step in our three-year transformation journey. This strategic 
reorganisation, leading to the establishment of TM Technology 
Services Sdn Bhd, was designed to enhance TM’s command 
in FMC, boost operational efficiencies and elevate customer 
experience.
4. Cont
inuous Engagement
TM actively engaged with key stakeholders, including the 
Government and regulatory bodies, to navigate industry 
changes effectively. These engagements have been crucial in 
refining our financial strategies and securing a strong industry 
position, enabling TM to adeptly handle market uncertainties.
5. Re
turn to Shareholders 
We have consistently honoured our financial obligations, 
showcasing a strong commitment to optimising returns for 
our shareholders while contributing positively to national 
development. In our dividend strategy, we aim to strike a 
balance between rewarding our investors and reinvesting in 
our business for sustainable growth.
We have declared a second Interim Dividend of 10.5 sen per 
share and a Final Dividend of 5.0 sen per share for the 
financial year 2023. Together with the Interim Dividend 
declared in August of last year, the Total Dividend for FY2023 
is 25.0 sen per share, a significant improvement from 16.5 
sen per share in 2022. This is also another record-breaking 
highest total distribution since our dividend policy revision in 
2018, a step up from the previous year. 
Our dedication to shareholders is underscored by our TSR, 
which have consistently exceeded the market average over 
the last four (4) years. This record showcases our competitive 
advantage, operational excellence and commitment to 
creating lasting value for our shareholders.

FINANCIAL POSITION
We maintained a robust financial position, ending the year with an 
increase in our cash and cash equivalents to RM2.70 billion, up 
from RM2.34 billion the previous year. This is a reflection of our 
effective cash flow management, driven by improved collections 
from customers and judicious capital expenditure throughout the 
year.
Our financial strategy and disciplined approach to capital 
management have allowed us to strengthen our cash reserves, 
laying a solid foundation in anticipation of larger debt repayments 
due in 2024 and 2025. This strong cash position demonstrates our 
sustained cash generation capability, crucial for supporting 
operational resilience and strategic agility amid upcoming financial 
commitments.
Throughout the year, we observed consistent improvements in our 
financial ratios, indicating better returns and a robust financial 
standing. These improvements are vital as they reflect our 
company’s overall health and stability, reinforcing our ability to 
grow and create value.
Our prudent financial management practices have ensured 
significant debt headroom, giving us the flexibility to access 
various financing options to support our strategic growth objectives. 
This financial flexibility is instrumental in maintaining our 
competitive edge and responding effectively to market opportunities 
or challenges.
CREDIT RATING
Despite the dynamic and challenging landscape, we successfully 
maintained robust credit ratings from both domestic and 
international rating agencies, reflecting our solid financials and 
ability to fulfil our financial commitments.

We recognise the integral relationship between our financial achievements and our broader corporate responsibilities. Our strategic 
resource allocation underpins our sustained business growth and affirms our commitment to fostering a Digital Malaysia. This 
commitment is evident in our 2023 capital expenditure, which accounted for 15.9% of our revenue or RM1.94 billion, strategically 
distributed across key growth areas:
These investments align with our sustainability goals, facilitating growth that is beneficial and responsible for all stakeholders. Thus, 
alongside our solid financial performance, we have maintained a steadfast focus on non-financial aspects such as reducing our carbon 
footprint, enhancing customer loyalty and promoting a strong organisational culture. This approach illustrates the successful integration 
of our financial and non-financial strategies.
Access: 58% of the 
expenditure was dedicated to 
enhancing our access network, 
ensuring reliable and extensive 
connectivity.
Core Network: 21% of the 
funds were invested in 
strengthening our core network 
infrastructure, which is crucial 
for upholding service quality 
and operational efficiency.
Support System: The remaining 
21% was directed towards 
upgrading our support systems, 
emphasising our dedication to 
technological progress and 
operational excellence.

DISCUSSION & DELIBERATION
Share the findings with the management team, who then rank the topics 
based on their importance to TM’s business. The rankings by stakeholders 
and TM management are then juxtaposed to arrive at the final material 
matters and materiality matrix.
VALIDATION & APPROVAL
Present the final findings to TM’s leadership 
team, with final approval from the BOD.
STAKEHOLDER 
PRIORITISATION
Identify and establish 
weightage for various 
stakeholder groups. 
This determines their 
level of impact on our 
business and strategic 
objectives.
INTERNAL 
ENGAGEMENT
Compile and analyse data 
from internal stakeholder 
engagement, such as 
customer complaints and 
employee surveys. This 
allows us to compare 
external engagement 
findings with internal 
feedback for more robust 
results.
EXTERNAL  
ENGAGEMENT
Conduct a multi-stakeholder engagement to capture their 
feedback and concerns. The stakeholders engaged in 2022 
included Customers, Employees, Suppliers, Regulators, Investors 
& Shareholders and Community Members.
Two (2) types of feedback are collected during the external 
engagement:
1. Q
ualitative Feedback: a ranking survey is shared to prioritise 
the material matters and develop the materiality matrix.
2. Q
uantitative Feedback: in-depth focus group discussions or 
interviews are conducted to capture more insights so that 
we can develop specific programmes and policies.

Our strategic decisions are based on Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (EESG) factors that can materially impact 
sustainable value creation. These material matters cover issues and areas that may influence stakeholder decisions as well as affect our 
long-term business growth. By focusing on our material matters, we are able to create value for our stakeholders in a more inclusive, 
integrated and sustainable manner.
Our material matters are identified via a materiality determination process. The last process was conducted in 2022. TM carries out a 
materiality determination process every three (3) years to ensure that our material matters are relevant and timely. Our material matters 
have guided our refreshed Sustainability Framework, which can be found on page 88.

OUR RISK 
MANAGEMENT 
JOURNEY
At TM, risk management is integral to our mission of creating stakeholder value and advancing our position as a Digital Powerhouse. 
Established in 1987, our Risk Management unit has evolved to not only identify risks but also to analyse their impact on our business, 
guiding decisions that align with our strategic goals and risk appetite.
A YEAR OF ENHANCED RISK MATURITY: ALIGNING WITH SUSTAINABILITY AND DIGITAL ASPIRATIONS
Our ERM has transformed from a standalone division managing risk to the formation of Group Risk Management (GRM). 
Alongside continuous monitoring of Principal Risks, GRM actively drives ERM programmes, addressing emerging risks and 
ensuring business resilience. This reflects our commitment to embedding sustainable practices and resilience in our journey 
towards digital innovation.
In 2023, TM’s new Risk Maturity Assessment aimed to gauge our risk maturity level and establish an improved baseline elevating 
our risk management framework. To strengthen our risk management capabilities, we have engaged TM’s Risk Fraternity (aka 
Risk Coordinators) through various programmes such as risk certification, training and knowledge sharing to enhance their skills 
and awareness.

Our journey to becoming a Digital Powerhouse is driven by strategically leveraging six (6) types of capitals. This approach allows us to 
balance immediate trade-offs with our long-term vision of growth and stakeholder value, aligning our business ambitions with our 
nation building commitment.
Our Warga TM serves as our execution engine. We prioritise investing in our employees, empowering them to propel our strategic 
objectives forward.
Our revenue and profits are channelled to both sustaining and growing our business operations. We allocate our financial resources 
towards compensating key stakeholders, funding various forms of capital and advancing our Digital Malaysia aspirations.
ACTIONS TO ENHANCE OUTCOMES

learning and help develop skills for the company’s new growth 
areas

fatigue, acknowledge Warga TM’s ideas and reward them for 
their achievements
TRADE-OFFS
We have allocated resources for right upskilling initiatives to 
cultivate a future-ready workforce, alongside implementing well-
being programmes to safeguard the physical and mental health of 
our employees. While this may have some impact on our Financial 
Capital initially, the enhanced productivity and acquisition of new 
skills will ultimately lead to increased profitability in the long-term.
ACTIONS TO ENHANCE OUTCOMES

research and development (Intellectual Capital), resource 
optimisation (Natural Capital) and the expansion of our network 
infrastructure (Manufactured Capital). Although this may temporarily 
reduce our Financial Capital reserves, we are confident that it will 
drive our long-term success and contribute to the advancement of 
our nation.

STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
The formulation of TM’s PWR 2030 strategy was an extensive process, undertaken to ensure that our strategic blueprint is robust, 
relevant and resilient amidst the rapidly evolving digital landscape. This comprehensive approach underscores our dedication to future-
proofing our business and our nation against the backdrop of global digital advancements.

Structured around defined timeframes, our strategy outlines specific objectives and execution plans across short, medium and long-term

THE LEADERSHIP
We initiated our strategy 
formulation by collaboratively 
engaging with TM’s 
Management and Strategy 
teams. This was crucial for 
crafting tailored strategies for 
each business cluster and 
setting clear strategic 
priorities.
A key element of our 
strategic formulation was 
aligning our objectives with 
national aspirations, 
embracing the Malaysia 
MADANI vision. This ensures 
that we contribute to 
Malaysia’s broader digital 
agenda, reinforcing our role 
in the nation’s digital 
transformation.
To ground our strategy in 
practicality and excellence, 
we benchmarked our 
strategies against global 
standards and validated them 
with global experts and 
industry specialists for best 
practice.
We ensure our Board 
members and leaders are 
equipped with the necessary 
insights and skills to 
navigate the evolving market 
challenges, not only in the 
digital realm but across 
various domains.
The Board’s Role  
The Board played a pivotal role in the strategy development process, providing guidance, reviewing strategic options and managing 
stakeholder engagement to address challenges and seize opportunities. At the year-end Board retreat, the Board reviewed and 
adopted the strategic plan for the TM Group, setting the stage for the future phases of strategic execution.

At TM Global, we are at the forefront of digital 
infrastructure development, serving as the enabler 
for service providers both in Malaysia and around 
the world. Our comprehensive range of wholesale 
data, connectivity and digital platform solutions 
have positioned us as a key player in driving 
digital inclusion as well as empowering 
communities with advanced technology.
In Malaysia, TM Global is the backbone of  
the nation’s digital infrastructure. Our commitment 
to digital inclusion is evident in our extensive  
network and initiatives. We have been  
instrumental in the deployment of 5G backhaul 
sites across the country, significantly contributing 
to the Government’s target for widespread  
digital coverage. Additionally, our advocacy for 
infrastructure sharing has enhanced Malaysia’s 
digital capabilities, ensuring that high-speed 
broadband is accessible nationwide.
On the international front, TM Global is expanding 
Malaysia’s digital footprint and forging strategic 
partnerships with global service providers to 
position Malaysia as a digital hub for the ASEAN 
region. Our participation in the Asia Link Cable 
System Consortium is a strategic move to cater 
to the increasing bandwidth demands across 
ASEAN and North Asia. Moving on to elevate our 
platform play initiatives and service portfolio for 
adjacent businesses, we have established a 
strategic partnership with a global carrier to jointly 
develop MEC.
We have also intensified our efforts to strengthen 
our global brand presence through multi-channel 
branding activities including targeted digital 
marketing campaigns, knowledge sharing by 
subject matter experts in major global events and 
renowned industry publications.

In the immediate future, TM Global is set to amplify its role as a key digital 
infrastructure enabler, focusing on delivering value-driven and customised 
solutions, bolstered by a robust domestic and international partnership 
ecosystem.

BECOMING A SUSTAINABILITY THOUGHT LEADER 
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond our operations, aiming to shape a broader ecosystem towards sustainable development. 
Through active participation in networks and forums, we not only improve our own sustainability practices but also contribute to shaping 
the broader agenda, establishing ourselves as thought leaders in this critical area.
As members of CAN’s Workstream 2 
(Capacity Building), we participated in 
knowledge-sharing sessions necessary 
to implement sustainable practices 
effectively. Furthermore, during the 
CAN Nature Retreat in July 2023, we 
contributed to strategic discussions on 
sustainability with key stakeholders.
CEO Action Network (CAN) United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC)
Since joining the UNGC in July 2023, 
we have been actively incorporating 
UNGC principles into our operations 
and received recognition through 
UNGC Awards in several categories. 
These accolades highlight our 
dedication to sustainable supply chain 
management, anti-corruption measures 
and educational partnerships. Notably, 
the TM Future Skills programme, 
aimed at enhancing educational 
opportunities for teachers and 
students, aligns with UNGC’s goals 
and our mission to foster sustainable 
development through community 
engagement.
TM-UNGC Sustainability Forum
We hosted our inaugural Sustainability 
Forum via a partnership with UNGC. 
The forum, centred around leveraging 
digital technology for sustainable 
business practices, highlighted  
our role as a catalyst for transformative 
discussions on sustainability  
integration.
Other Industry Sharing Sessions:
At the Dell Technology Forum and the National Association of Women Entrepreneurs of Malaysia (NAWEM) ESG Conference 
2023, we shared insights into our sustainability practices and social impact.
The Khazanah Sustainability Circle featured TM presenting findings from our TCFD report, focusing on climate risk 
management.
The Malaysia Digital Expo and the MCMC Digital Outlook Series served as platforms for TM to discuss the integration of 
sustainability in digital technology and outline our strategic journey.
We moderated a session on ESG partnerships at the 8th Selangor Smart City & Digital Economy Conference, focusing on 
stakeholder engagement for sustainable outcomes.

Integration of Sustainability into  
Board Governance
At TM, sustainability is integral to the 
Board’s agenda, with a dedicated chapter 
in the Board Charter titled “Strategy 
Towards Promoting Sustainability”. This 
ensures sustainability considerations are 
embedded in all Board discussions and 
decisions. Additionally, sustainability 
features prominently on the BRIC 
agenda, highlighting its importance 
across all areas of Board deliberation.
The BRIC, led by its Chairman, is tasked 
with managing climate-related risks, 
which are reviewed quarterly. At the 
management level, oversight of our 
carbon reduction targets is shared 
between the GCFO and Chief Network 
Officer (CNO), with responsibilities 
cascading across all relevant managerial 
tiers.
Physical climate risks fall under the 
purview of the Group Risk Management 
function and are managed across 
various functions in the organisation.

Moreover, selected TM PEDi locations have broadened their impact by offering health screening services, demonstrating our dedication 
to holistic community support. Through PEDi, we not only offer a digital lifeline but also foster inclusivity and equal opportunities across 
the nation.
Further, we actively support MSMEs in enhancing their digitalisation efforts through the Government’s GDPM initiative. This initiative not 
only accelerates digital transformation among MSMEs but also contributes to broader efforts to reform the digital economy. Our goal is 
to become a digital partner that is economically practical and inclusive for MSMEs.

Driving MSME Empowerment via Digitalisation2
We offered more coverage options to MSMEs through Unifi Business and Unifi Mobile subscriptions and facilitated their digitalisation via 
the Government’s GDPM initiative. Additionally, we provided complimentary masterclasses aimed at helping MSMEs to maximise the 
benefits of their subscribed solutions and elevate their businesses to the next level.
We also enriched TM’s bundle offerings by integrating connectivity and mobile services with digital solutions, such as:
Digital Marketing  
Solution (DMS)

Strategic Partnerships for Digital Expansion4
In 2023, we continued to work closely with Government bodies to improve digital access and literacy to rural and underserved 
communities. A key collaboration with the Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation (SDEC) focused on boosting digital services in Sarawak, 
supporting the state’s digital and post-COVID development strategies. This collaboration led to significant achievements, such as the 
Sarawak Multimedia Authority Rural Telecommunication (SMART) project, aiming to boost digital inclusivity and fostering the growth of 
Sarawak’s digital economy.
Additionally, we spearheaded the Selangor Government Data Exchange Enabler (SelGDX) project, involving more than 70 Government entities. 
This initiative created an integrated data-sharing platform, improving decision-making and collaboration within Selangor’s public sector.

As we extend our reach to improve the lives of all Malaysians, we have a moral and social 
responsibility to manage our environmental impact. People rely on the natural environment for critical 
resources, livelihoods and their quality of life. As we focus on addressing the climate emergency, it 
is also important not to lose sight of addressing other environmental issues that can impact current

Although solid waste generation increased in 2022 due to office relocations, we observed a significant decrease in 2023. This reduction 
is due to ongoing flexible working arrangements and heightened environmental consciousness among our employees.
Waste Management (metric tonnes) 2021 2022 2023
Total Solid Waste 467.1 1,013.9 32.8
Total Scheduled Waste 1.3 1.1 1.4
To improve water efficiency within our facilities, we have introduced smart solutions and conducted water saving initiatives, especially at sites 
with high employee density, to foster a culture of responsible water use. Among these initiatives are the installation of sensor-based faucets 
and the optimisation of cistern systems to reduce water wastage. These measures have collectively led to a 26.7% reduction in water 
consumption across our operations.
1. Printer Reduction 
Nationwide
Reduce number of printers 
across TM nationwide. 
Divisions with multiple 
floors, may only have one 
(1) or two (2) printers
2. Printing  
Settings
Ensure printer settings are 
configured for duplex and 
grayscale printing. In 
addition, stricter colour 
printing management will 
be implemented
3. Digital Review
Review documents 
digitally prior to printing. 
This will eliminate 
unnecessary printouts and
contribute to a paperless 
workflow
4. Printer Utilisation  
Review
Drive digital document 
adoption among divisions 
and businesses that have 
higher paper consumption
Minimising Waste Generation2
Throughout 2023, we implemented waste segregation systems at specific sites, sorting waste into solid and scheduled categories as per 
the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations 2005, to streamline and enhance our sustainability practices. Additionally, we 
encouraged employees to adopt paperless activities and embrace the 3R concept: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. For 2024, our target is 
to achieve a 50% reduction in paper usage against our 2023 baseline of 3,681,111 pages. 
Effective 1 March 2024, we have instituted the following measures to streamline printing practices, in alignment with TM’s sustainability 
goals and digital strategy:
Responsible Water Practices3
HOW WE WILL MOVE FORWARD
We are set to broaden our environmental policy to encompass sustainable resource use, biodiversity conservation and a firm commitment 
to zero deforestation. Through proactive strategies and stringent policies, we aim to protect ecosystems and minimise our environmental 
impact.
Our medium-term strategy targets ISO14001 and Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) certifications, globally-recognised standards 
that will benchmark our environmental management practices and demonstrate our commitment to ongoing improvement. We will also 
set specific goals for waste and water to reduce our ecological footprint and boost resource efficiency.

WHAT IS OUR APPROACH
Our approach to reducing carbon involves improving operational efficiency, investing in low-carbon technologies and 
using renewable energy. We encourage teamwork across all organisational levels to enhance our energy-saving and 
emissions-reduction efforts. Additionally, we continue to improve our carbon monitoring and reporting, furthering 
our commitment to comprehensive carbon management. We measure and report our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in our core in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
TM’s Carbon Accounting
Scope 1: Direct Emissions from Fuel Consumption
What it Covers: Fuel consumed by our vehicle fleet. 
Emissions are calculated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories, 2006 and Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Emissions Factors 2023.
Note: Carbon emissions from fuel purchase for gensets have been calculated and disclosed. However, they have not been included in our current 
reporting boundaries.
Scope 2: Indirect Emissions from Electricity Consumption
What it Covers: Includes all TM network and commercial buildings in Peninsular Malaysia. In 2023, we refined our data centre 
boundaries to correct an overestimation, ensuring an accurate representation of TM’s electricity use.
We convert electricity use into carbon emissions based on The Malaysia Energy Information Hub (MEIH) Grid Emissions Factor 
for Peninsular Malaysia - Sabah and Sarawak. 
We are also increasing our renewable energy mix by utilising Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) to shift towards sustainable energy sources and lower our carbon emissions.
Scope 3: Other Indirect Emissions
What it Covers: 
1. W
aste: Carbon emissions from two (2) categories, including (i) Scheduled Waste and (ii) Commercial and Industrial Waste 
are calculated using the waste type specific method from the GHG Protocol according to emissions factor from DEFRA

Strategic Approach to Carbon Management: The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) emissions factors are 
used as they provide the latest available factors where data is unavailable for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The 
DEFRA emissions factors also comprehensively cover all the seven (7) primary greenhouse gases listed by the Kyoto Protocol that 
contribute to climate change. The emissions factors are also available in ‘kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per unit’, maintaining 
consistency with Global Warming Potential (GWP) assesment based on the IPCC Fifth Assesment Report (ARS) over a 100-year period.

Scope 2: Emissions from the Consumption of Electricity for Network & Buildings2
In addressing electricity consumption, we have enhanced energy efficiency and increased our renewable energy usage, resulting in a 
significant reduction of 9% in electricity usage in 2023 against the baseline year which equates to a decrease in emissions by 79,978 
tCO2e.
Our efforts are organised as follows:
Network
As the nation’s telecommunications provider, the bulk of our electricity is consumed by network infrastructure. Therefore, we optimised 
electricity consumption by decommissioning legacy networks and transitioning to more efficient systems, resulting in RM3.6 million in 
cost savings.
Network Element Shutdown
Implemented network modernisation to operate only high-
efficiency network elements, including the deactivation of 
underutilised elements and migration of services to networks 
with higher utilisation rates.

Scope 3: Emissions from Other Activities3
Our climate action extends beyond fuel and electricity reduction. We also track and report indirect forms of emissions to gain a better 
understanding of all potential improvement areas. These include:
Scope 3 Initiatives & Progress
Waste 
Generation
Enforced strict waste segregation at designated sites, distinguishing between solid and scheduled wastes 
according to the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations 2005. Promoted paperless operations 
and the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle principle, achieving significant waste management improvements
Business 
Travel
Shifted to virtual meetings to minimise business travel, significantly reducing the need for employee air travel. This 
approach contributed to cost savings and a reduction in Scope 3 emissions, aligning with our sustainability goals
We collected information and computed employee commute for the first time in 2023. However, emissions stemming from this were 
omitted from the overall 2023 emissions to maintain consistency with the boundary established in the 2019 baseline.

Health & Safety Governance
The governance of our health and safety initiatives is structured across multiple tiers, ensuring effective oversight and implementation:
 T ier 1
The TM OSHE Steering Committee provides strategic guidance and policy oversight whereas, our Management Committee (MC) 
provides strategic guidance on accidents involving fatalities and actions involving legal issues.
 T ier 2
OSHE Committees within specific Business Units and Subsidiaries create customised safety measures.
 T ier 3
At the local level, OSHE Committees in Regions, States and TM facilities, along with Building & Premise OSHE Committees (BPOCs), 
guarantee the implementation and compliance with safety standards at TM buildings and premises.
Strategic OSH Enhancements1  
In 2023, we focused on strategic enhancements to improve workplace safety, risk minimisation and compliance with safety standards 
through several key initiatives.
Key Enhancements in 2023:
Initiative What We Did
KPIs for OSHE Introduced and implemented OSHE KPIs across critical LoBs, including Group Network and 
Technology (GNT) division, Support Business division and TM One, enabling precise OSH 
performance monitoring and fostering a culture of safety improvement.
OSHE Committee & 
Structure Enhancements
Established the Network State OSHE Committee and Regional Facilities Management (FM) 
OSHE Committee to enhance OSH governance, enhancing strategic oversight and coordination 
of safety initiatives.
OSH Coordinators Appointed dedicated OSH Coordinators for State Network and Regional FM to address and 
manage OSH issues, thus strengthening adherence to safety protocols.
TM OSHE Portal Established interactive OSHE portal as a one-stop reference to TM employees.
Preventive & Mitigation Actions2  
Our OSH risk mitigation and management in 2023 focused on proactive safety management to prevent accidents and minimise risks. 
We initiated efforts to extend the scope of our ISO45001 to our state operations, starting with Sarawak.
A critical component of our risk mitigation strategy has been the focused implementation of hazard identification, risk analysis and risk 
control across our LoBs, operations and supplier operations. This included a comprehensive review and development of HIRARC in 
various operational areas to ensure our workforce thoroughly understands and implements safety measures.
Through these measures, we aim to enhance the safety and health standards for both our employees and suppliers, emphasising our 
dedication to maintaining a safe working environment for all stakeholders.

Progress in Training & Development1
In 2023, 18,788 Warga TM, representing 99% of our total workforce, were trained through comprehensive Future-Skilling, Leadership,  
Re-skilling/Upskilling and Culture programmes. This extensive training effort encompassed 1,988 sessions, more than 70% of which  
were conducted via virtual or online delivery modes, aligning with our commitment to digital learning. 
These initiatives not only enhanced the competencies and capabilities of our workforce but also contributed to tangible business 
outcomes, including increased revenue and strategic growth opportunities.
The Kirkpatrick training evaluation model, a globally recognised standard for measuring the impact of training, has been strategically
implemented to assess various dimensions of training effectiveness. This model evaluates training from four (4) crucial perspectives: 
participants’ satisfaction, learning achievement, behaviour change at the workplace and the overall impact on business outcomes.
In 2023, we consistently outperformed our expectations across E1, E2 and E3 evaluation levels and contributed significant business 
impact in some of the trainings delivered. This demonstrated the effectiveness of our training delivery.

Consistent with our commitment to build a sustainable supply chain, we carry out periodic monitoring of ESG compliance and practices 
amongst our mega and mid-tier suppliers. Our monitoring efforts provide valuable insights for continuous improvement and vendor 
development.
In 2023, we conducted a more in-depth ESG Survey, coupled with on-site assessments at the premises of strategically significant suppliers. 
This initiative targeted 60% mega partners and 50% mid-tier suppliers. The assessment spanned a broad spectrum of ESG domains, 
including environmental sustainability, economic impact, labour standards, adherence to human rights, corporate governance, health and 
safety protocols, diversity and inclusion practices and ethical business conduct. The survey provided insights to our mega and mid-tier 
suppliers’ ESG management and compliance, enabling the development of targeted improvement plans.

of our supply chain upholds our commitment to environmental and ethical standards through continuous improvement and innovation. 
Our strategy includes conducting sustainability assessments, enhancing sustainability initiatives and providing comprehensive training for 
our suppliers.
As part of our Sustainable Supply Chain Roadmap, we are in the midst of developing a sustainable supply chain policy that embeds 
sustainability into the fabric of our supplier engagement process. This involves establishing sustainability criteria for supplier selection 
and performance reviews. By aligning our business practices with our sustainability goals, TM is dedicated to making a lasting, positive 
impact on our community and the environment.

Managing Third-Party Security Risks3
In our interconnected digital ecosystem, managing third-party information security risks is paramount. Therefore, we have implemented 
stringent security measures to ensure that our partners and suppliers adhere to the highest standards of information security.
Overall Performance4
With the rise in online breaches due to increased cyber threats and reliance on digital platforms, we have bolstered security defences in 
2023. As a result, we achieved zero data loss and received no complaints on data loss, highlighting effective cyber security measures 
and dedication to protecting our stakeholders digital integrity.
In 2023, fraud detection initiatives were ramped up. As such, over 70% of the online breaches were due to fraud incidents. Multiple 
controls were fortified by end of the year. As a result, we have drastically reduced the number of fraud incidents since late December 
2023 till March 2024.
We only had one (1) breach involving historical customers’ personal information. No financial information was impacted. We took prompt 
measures to protect the data across our platforms and we sent out notifications to customers informing them of the data breach and 
to be wary of phishing tactics including online scams, suspicious links and unsolicited phone calls. We promptly reported this matter to 
the relevant authorities, namely National Cyber Coordination and Command Centre, Department of Privacy and Data Protection and 
MCMC.

TM conducted an internal reorganisation in 2023 to streamline its core business and subsidiaries under TM Technology Services Sdn 
Bhd (TM Tech) to be the main operating entity of the Group. This initiative is expected to further improve operational efficiencies, 
streamline processes and simplify customer touchpoints to provide a more seamless customer experience, ensuring TM’s sustainability 
in the industry.
Our Board continues to align TM’s role as a PLC and GLC whilst playing a key role in driving national initiatives towards Digital Malaysia, 
ensuring sustainable development through connectivity and technology, while providing support to the nation through various Corporate 
Responsibility initiatives. 
 
TM’s Governance Framework is crafted according to the rules, requirements and provisions laid out in the following documents:
•
 Comp
anies Act 2016;
•
  Main 
Market Listing Requirements (Main LR) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa Securities);
•
  Mala
ysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) issued by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC);
•
 Corpo
rate Governance Guide published by Bursa Malaysia Berhad; 
•
  Guide
lines on Conduct of Directors of Listed Corporations and their Subsidiaries issued by the SC; and
•
  Intern
ational best practices and standards on corporate governance.
As part of the Group’s Governance Framework, specific responsibilities are delegated to the relevant Board Committees and Management 
Committees, providing support to our Board in key areas such as financial review, human capital management, internal control and risk 
management, as well as governance, procurement and sustainability matters. 
TM’s Governance Framework is supported by the Board Charter, Limits of Authority (LoA) Matrix, Business Policy and Governance (BPG) 
and the recently approved Directors & Management’s Conflict of Interest Policy (COI). An annual review of the Board Charter is conducted, 
whilst the LoA and BPG are reviewed and updated in line with the Group’s internal reorganisation and transformation initiatives.
TM, collectively the Board of Directors, Management and staff, continue to strive for 
better implementation of the highest standards for corporate governance throughout the 
organisation, which is fundamental in delivering consistent financial performance, creating 
long-term economic and sustainable value to all stakeholders to achieve sustainable 
performance and business throughout the Group. TM believes that good corporate 
governance improves the Group’s business oversight, management and operations, 
contributing to stakeholder value creation.

Board Leadership & 
Effectiveness
Effective Audit &
Risk Management
Integrity in Corporate 
Reporting & Meaningful 
Relationship with  
Stakeholders
A
 B
 C
As at the FYE 31 December 2023, TM has applied 46 out of the 48 recommended practices in the MCCG including the five (5) Step-up 
Practices save for Practice 8.3: Step Up on the disclosure of detailed remuneration of each member of senior management on a named 
basis and Practice 5.2: Composition of independent directors for large companies. 
Changes to the Board composition since 1 November 2023, comprising a resignation and the appointments of two (2) new Non-
Independent Non-Executive Directors (NINED), have resulted the Board composition ratio of independent and non-independent to be equal.
For comprehensive overview of TM’s application of MCCG’s practices, this Corporate Governance Overview Statement is to be read 
together with the Corporate Governance Report (CG Report) 2023, which further elaborates how the practices of the MCCG are applied 
and any departure thereto. The CG Report is available on the Company’s website at tm.com.my.
During the year, the Board has undertaken to revitalise its investment review functions previously under the Board Investment Committee 
(BIC), which was disbanded in September 2021. The Board’s scrutiny of TM Group’s investment activities was revived and this function 
was cascaded to the existing Board Risk Committee (BRC), with powers to inter alia review, evaluate and recommend to the Board the 
Management’s recommendations on investment and divestment. Pursuant thereto, on 1 January 2024, BRC was restructured and 
renamed as the Board Risk and Investment Committee (BRIC) to undertake a review of risk, investment and sustainability matters for 
TM Group.

DISCHARGING THE BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board’s principal responsibility is to promote the 
long-term success of our Company and deliver sustainable 
value to our shareholders. The Board assumes overall 
responsibility and accountability for the smooth 
functioning of core processes involving Board governance, 
business value and ethical oversight. It also collectively 
takes responsibility for the Company’s leadership and to 
meet the objectives and goals of the Company. In 
discharging its roles and responsibilities, the Board is 
also mindful of the need to protect the interests of all 
stakeholders.
During the year, the Board has undergone several 
changes:
•  Appointment of Dato’ Zainal Abidin Putih, Non-
Independent Non-Executive Chairman (NINEC), on 
1 August 2023 in place of Tan Sri Mohammed 
Azlan Hashim as Chairman.
• 
 Appointment 
of Amar Huzaimi Md Deris, Non-
Independent Executive Director (NIED), on  
1 August 2023 in place of Datuk Imri Mokhtar as 
MD/GCEO.
•
  R
esignation of Dato’ Anis Rizana Mohd Zainudin 
@ Mohd Zainuddin, a NINED representing MOF 
Inc., and cessation of her alternate, Iszad Jeffri 
Ismail, on 25 September 2023.
•
  A
ppointment of Ahmad Taufek Omar, a NINED on 
1 November 2023. 
• 
 Appointment 
of Datuk Dr. Sharazat Haji Ahmad 
on 15 December 2023, representing MOF Inc. and 
Iszad Jeffri as her alternate on the same day.
Board activities are structured to provide the Directors 
with effective management oversight to support the  
MD/GCEO and Management team. In December 2023, a 
two-day Board Retreat was held that encompassed both 
deliberation on strategic and annual operating plan (AOP) 
to re-evaluate and assess the Group’s business direction 
and strategy following the change of top leadership in 
August 2023. 
During the year, TM’s existing sustainability framework 
was reviewed in line with the dynamic market and 
regulatory trends in the sustainability space and TM’s 
business goals. Acknowledging the importance of 
continuously upholding strong sustainability ratings and 
corporate reputation, our Board has, in November 2023, 
adopted a revised framework for Sustainable Growth and 
Shared Value Creation as well as the updated 
Sustainability Roadmap for 2024-2026. 
BOARD CHARTER
The Board Charter provides a clear description of the 
duties and responsibilities of the Board, its committees 
and Directors. It is a primary source of reference for the 
Board on our governance practices and Board policies 
and guidelines. Matters requiring approvals from Board 
and/or Committees are provided in the Board Charter.
The Board reviews the Board Charter from time to time 
to ensure it remains relevant to the Company’s objectives 
and strategies in alignment with current rules and 
regulations. During the year, the Board Charter underwent 
two (2) revisions, involving enhancements to the terms of 
reference (ToR) of the Board, BAC, BTC and the 
reconstitution of BRC into BRIC which incorporates the 
ToR for risks, investments and sustainability elements.
DEMARCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN 
THE BOARD, BOARD COMMITTEES & 
MANAGEMENT
The Board Charter demarcates the roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, Board Committees and 
Management, and identifies the specific roles and 
responsibilities of the Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director (SID), Non-Executive Director (NED) and the 
Executive Director (ED). Clear demarcation of functions 
provides ease of observation and avoids imbalance of 
authority or control by the Board, eliminating the prospect 
of one individual or group dominating the decision-
making process.
Having Directors with diverse experiences, skills and 
expertise contributed to the Board’s diversity, ensuring an 
effective and functioning Board, which promote healthy, 
engaging and robust discussions at meetings. With a 
sound CG Framework and clarity regarding the Board’s 
roles and responsibilities, our Board has been able to 
make effective decisions.
Different individuals hold the positions of Chairman and 
MD/GCEO at all times and they have clear and distinct 
roles, as documented in the Board Charter. The 
composition of the committees’ memberships was 
reviewed in 2023 and Q1 2024. TM Board Chairman is 
not Chairman or member in any Board Committees. In 
2023, BAC Chairman also did not sit in any other Board 
Committees.

The Board adopts a top-down strategy to incorporate TM’s values 
of good governance and accountability from the leadership level 
and cascades these across the Group. The CBE, Anti-Corruption 
Guide and Whistle Blowing Policy, with sound principles and 
standards of good practice, apply to Directors, employees and 
suppliers. These cultivate awareness, promote an anti-corruption 
culture and create integrity, transparency and accountability 
throughout our operations.
Details of the above can be referred to under Good Governance in 
the Sustainability section of this IAR.
BOARD COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY
The Board has further strengthened Group- wide sustainability 
management by adopting an updated framework for Sustainable 
Growth and Shared Value Creation and the updated 2024-2026 
Sustainability Roadmap.
Details of TM’s sustainability targets and initiatives can be referred 
to the Sustainability section of this IAR.
BOARD COMPOSITION
The Board composition during the year under review represents a 
mix of skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to TM’s business. 
The Board’s composition underwent several changes during the 
financial year 2023. The overview of the Board current composition 
is as follows:
                    > 1- 3 years                                                               > 3- 6 years
                            < 1 year                                                                                 > 6-9 years

As at 31 December 2023, the Board composition continues to 
comply with Paragraph 15.02(1) of the Main LR, with more than 
one-third of the directors being independent, i.e. 50%. However, it 
falls short of the MCCG requirements for large companies to have 
majority independent directors. The Board took cognisance of the 
situation and is committed to comply with the Practice by 
reviewing the composition, taking into consideration the required 
skill sets, experience and diversity.
Details of the Directors, including their qualifications, experience 
and tenure (as at the date of this report) and any COI or potential 
COI, can be referred to in the Profile of Board of Directors section 
of this IAR.
BOARD SKILLS & EXPERTISE
NRC undertakes the responsibility of identifying, evaluating and 
selecting Directors with the right mix of skills, competencies, 
experience and other qualities that are required for a robust, fast 
paced telecommunication industry Board.
The rapid technological evolution in the telecommunication 
industry compels the Directors to be up to mark on relevant 
changes by attending more industry related training and courses 
during the year. A collective total of 154 training hours spent by 
the current Directors as at the financial year end on industry 
related courses (2022: 297 hours, 2021: 96 hours).

BOARD SUCCESSION PLANNING & APPOINTMENT
Board Independence
The Directors’ independence is assessed annually by the Board with NRC’s advice prior to their reappointment. Directors’ fit and proper 
assessment, including their skills, experiences, contributions, backgrounds and family relationships are the determinants in assessing the 
Directors’ independence and objectivity needed in the Board. Criteria illustrated under Paragraph 1.01 of the Main LR are also assessed 
to ascertain the INED’s independence. This include independent of management, free from any business or other relationship which could 
interfere with the exercise of independent judgement or the ability to act in the best interests of the Company and also being independent 
of the major shareholders.
Compliance to MCCG
The Board has adopted Practice 5.4 of 
the MCCG on the limitation of nine (9) 
years cumulative tenure for INED 
without further extension. As at the 
date of this IAR, none of our INEDs’ 
tenure exceeds the cumulative term 
limit of nine (9) years.
Board Diversity
To ensure TM has a diverse Board with a range of relevant skills and experiences, the selection process for Board members is imperative 
to ensure there is good governance and a constructive Board. The diversity elements include gender, ethnicity/race, nationality, religious 
beliefs, cultural or socio-economic backgrounds and age, which enable a wealth of perspective and vibrancy of discussion in the 
boardroom. Boardroom diversity also includes experiences, skills and competencies of the Directors which enable the Company to 
maximise business and governance performance. 
Disclosure on Interest
During the year, Directors have, to the best of their abilities, disclosed 
their interests or any possible COI on any matter put forth before the 
Board for consideration according to the requirements in the Main LR. 
Any interests and their extent and possible conflict that may arise from 
the said interest that the Director may have is recorded and registered 
and the Directors would abstain from participating in the deliberation 
and decision of the matter involved.

INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023

---- Page 179 ----
2023 observed revisions to the Board membership and composition. 
Beginning 2023, TM complied with majority independence 
composition ratio but failed to maintain the position by end of 
December 2023.
An independent assessment on the Directors’ performance and 
contribution based on the Self and Peer Assessment was carried 
out through the BPA/BEE for FYE 2023. Directors’ fit and proper 
assessments, as well as the independence of the Independent 
Directors were also assessed.
The assessment on diversity ascertains the Directors’ technical 
proficiencies based on their education, work experience, behavioural 
and technical competencies. The assessment evaluates diversity 
of the Board’s background, education and skill sets that are 
needful in order to meet the needs of the Company. Various 
dimensions were taken into account in evaluating the diversification 
of the Board. These elements determine the presence of the Board’s 
unification, respect, trust and camaraderie amongst the Directors 
that fosters a collaborative environment in the Board, but nonetheless 
maintaining the independence and influence-free members. 
 
The Board was found to be collegial, with no domineering 
personalities, factionalism or disruptive power play. There is 
inclusivity and collaborative environment in the Boardroom.
DIRECTORS’ RETIREMENT & RE-ELECTION
The four (4) newly appointed directors during the year will be 
retiring pursuant to Clause 106(2) of the Company’s Constitution. 
These Directors are:
a) 
 D
ato’ Zainal Abidin Putih, NINEC, appointed on 1 August 2023, 
has demonstrated strong leadership and acts as an effective 
sounding board for Board and Management. With his 
extensive experience in the corporate sector, he is able to 
guide, advise, give views and support both the Board and 
Management. Based on the 2023 BPA/BEE assessment, the 
findings underscore the Chairman’s pivotal role as a mediator 
and influential figure within TM, embodying a “fair process 
leadership” approach to bridge the gap between the Board 
and Management.
b) 
 A

years of experience in the telecommunication industry. He

strong technical and industry knowledge, leadership qualities 
and astute business acumen. He was able to lead the 
Management team in formulating the Group’s long-term 
strategy to become a Digital Powerhouse by 2030. Amar 
Huzaimi has a clear purpose of balancing TM’s dual role of 
PLC and GLC, as well as nation building in support of Digital 
Malaysia’s aspirations. Based on the 2023 BPA/BEE 
assessment, he displayed strategic thinking and ability to  
guide the Board and Management towards achieving the 
Company’s goals.

disciplines. 
d) 
 A
hmad Taufek Omar, a NINED and a former employee of the 
Company, has familiarity and insights from the perspective of 
a former executor of Board’s decisions on business directives 
and decisions. He has fitted seamlessly in his new role as a 
TM director. Ahmad Taufek is able to provide his perspective 
on the capabilities, advantages and challenges faced by the 
organisation. Based on the 2023 BPA/BEE assessment, he is 
seen as someone who is able to provide amplification to the 
strategic and tactical play of the Company.
Pursuant to Clause 112 of TM’s Constitution, all directors shall 
retire from office once at least every three (3) years. Based on the 
requirement of Clause 113, the remaining one third or nearest to 
one third of the directors shall retire by rotation. The following 
Directors are to retire pursuant to Clause 112 and they were rated 
favourably in the BPA/BPE:
a) 
 Tunku 
Afwida Tunku Dato’ A.Malek, SID, Chairman of NRC 
and member of BAC and BRIC, have actively provided 
leadership, constructive opinion, critical feedback and insights 
at Board and Committee meetings. She demonstrated her 
strong principles on governance and integrity-related matters 
throughout her tenure at TM.
b) 
 B
alasingham A. Namasiwayam, INED and Chairman of BTC, 
actively participates in discussions and is cohesive in making 
his points and arguments based on his more than 50 years’ 
experience in telecommunication industry. He continued to 
demonstrate his capabilities, commitment and dedication 
towards the Board and Company through the years of service 
for TM. 
c) 
 Saheran 
Suhendran, INED, is an experienced corporate and 
commercial lawyer. He actively participates in discussions 
and is meticulous in putting forth his views at Board and 
Committee meetings. He is firm on issues, demonstrating 
professionalism and independence of judgement. Based on 
the 2023 BPA/BEE assessment, he is a highly detailed-
oriented individual and acts as a gatekeeper to the board.
 
Having served as Directors for nearly eight (8) years, Tunku Afwida 
Tunku Dato’ A.Malek and Balasingham A. Namasiwayam have 
expressed their intention not to seek for re-election at the 
forthcoming 39th AGM. Hence, both Directors will retain office until 
the conclusion of the 39 th AGM.

BOARD EFFECTIVENESS & TRAINING
BPA/BEE and Board Management Effectiveness Programme 
(BMEP)
2023 marked the completion of the three-year cycle, where TM is 
to carry out the BEE externally by an independent consultant in 
accordance with Practice 6.1 of the MCCG. Deloitte Business 
Advisory Sdn Bhd (Deloitte) was engaged to conduct the board 
evaluations to ascertain the Board’s overall level of effectiveness 
and identify areas for improvement.
In addition, the Group Company Secretary has also carried out the 
BMEP survey, an assessment tool to measure the strength of 
selected Pivotal Positions’ (C-levels) working relationship and 
engagement with the Board. The results of the BMEP survey are 
incorporated in the Pivotal Positions and Group Company 
Secretary’s Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Scorecard.
Further to the BPA/BEE 2023 findings and recommendation, the 9 
improvement plans recommended based on the findings from the 
BEE 2022 were implemented and duly completed in 2023. They 
comprised the following:
• 
 Stre
ngthen the Board’s capabilities, improving trust and 
relationship with Management;
•
  Improve
 management and meeting frequency and narrative on 
the proposal; and
• 
 R
eview the composition of Board and Committees for 
effectiveness.
12 directors (including an alternate) and six (6) Senior Management, 
participated in the 2023 BPA/BEE. The assessment was conducted 
independently without any due interference from the Directors  
and Management. The findings were then presented to the NRC 
and Board for discussion. The assessment covered the following 
areas:
•
 B
oard Governance and Oversight;
•
 B
oard Processes and Infrastructure; 
•
 B
oard Composition and Diversity Assessment; 
•
 Se
lf and Peer Assessments; 
•
 F
it and Proper Assessment; 
•
 Ind
ependence Assessment; and
•
 B
oard Committees’ Assessments.
The 2023 BPA/BEE highlighted the virtuous commitment and 
accountability demonstrated by the Board. The Board is noted for 
their willingness to express their preferential view and objective 
opinions that contribute to a dynamic and engaged Board. The 
Board is consistent in its need to keep abreast of developments 
and initiatives in relation to ESG and sustainability. The BEE also 
indicated that sustainability warrants further attention and should 
form part of discussion in every aspect of the Board’s consideration.
The BPA/BEE also assesses the effectiveness of the Board 
Committees, particularly their composition, succession plan, 
members’ qualification, knowledge and expertise. The Committees 
were rated between 87% to 67% based on skills, composition 
functionalities and oversight responsibilities.
Self and Peer Evaluation is conducted to assess each Director’s 
professional competency, attributes and personality. Directors’ 
Peer Evaluation overall results were rated 3.7 and above.
Board Training Programme (BTP)
BTP allows directors equal opportunity to keep abreast with 
current developments in the industry, whether internally or through 
external means. Directors are encouraged to equip themselves 
with a variety of information to better equip themselves with the 
changes and challenges in the telecommunication industry 
specifically and other programmes that could facilitate the effective 
discharge of their duties. 
 
The Board Committees also participated in knowledge-sharing 
programmes designed to enhance members’ skills and help them 
better serve their respective Committees.
Details of the training attended by the Board are further elaborated 
in the CG Report.
DIRECTORS & SENIOR MANAGEMENT’S REMUNERATION
The Directors’ remuneration packages are enumerated in the 
Board Remuneration and Benefits Policy (BRBP) and have been 
carefully aligned with industry practices to be competitive and 
equitable with the intent to retain talent while upholding the 
interest of our shareholders. The policy and framework for the 
overall remuneration of the ED and NEDs are reviewed against 
market practices by the NRC, following which recommendations 
are submitted to the Board for approval.

Non-Executive Chairman (NEC) & Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) 
TM Board Remuneration
NEC and NEDs’ remuneration package is determined with the Board’s consensus. Director’s fee is based on a standard fixed fee while 
meeting allowances are paid based on attendance at Board and Committee meetings. 
Since the last review of the BRBP in 2022, no revision has been proposed to the prevailing Directors’ fee quantum, as they are still 
competitive, appropriate and in line with the prevalent market rate. The NEC and NEDs are not entitled to participate in any employee 
share scheme or variable performance-linked incentive schemes.
TM Subsidiaries’ Remuneration 
Directors on TM subsidiary are compensated in accordance to TM Subsidiary Tiering Framework (STF). TM subsidiaries are categorised 
into three (3) tiers according to the subsidiary’s business importance, shareholding structure and profit contribution. On 1 November 2023, 
Board approved the revision to the Subsidiaries Remuneration Framework (SRF) whereby the Directors’ fees for TM’s NEC and NEDs 
appointed on Tier 1 and other subsidiaries were abolished.
Fees’ Structure 
The benefits payable applicable to NEC and NEDs based on the BRBP are meeting fees, emoluments and claimable benefits. The 
following is the current TM Directors’ fee structure until the next AGM of the Company.
* UTSB – Universiti Telekom Sdn Bhd
Directors are also accorded benefits such as claimable benefits on leave passage, business equipment, telecommunication bills, insurance 
and medical coverage.
Meeting attendance allowances are payable to NEDs only and payable for each Board and/or Board Committee meeting held on a per-
meeting basis. The said allowances are payable to the Alternate Director who attends meetings in the absence of his/her substantive 
Director.

Key Objectives
The NRC has carried a dual role since its inception. The nomination and remuneration were combined for the purpose of 
expediency and practicality, whereby the same members were entrusted with both functions. In addition, the NRC oversees 
corporate governance matters.
Membership
During 2023, the existing number of four (4) members was maintained, all of whom are NEDs. As of 20 March 2024, NRC 
increased its membership to five (5) whilst continuing to maintain majority of independent directors. Tunku Afwida, being the 
SID, continues her role as the Chairperson, effectively providing the needed leadership to the NRC. The addition of Ahmad 
Taufek Omar as a new member adds diversity to the skill sets and experience in the committee based on his experience in 
senior leadership roles in various local organisations.
Responsibilities
NRC’s nomination primary role is to assist the Board in reviewing and determining its appropriate size and balance to provide 
the required mix of responsibilities, skills and experiences. NRC ensures the Board composition meets the needs of the 
Company and develops, maintains and reviews the criteria to be used in the recruitment process and annual assessment of 
directors.
NRC’s primary remuneration function is to support the Board in maintaining, assessing and developing a policy framework on 
all elements of the remuneration for the ED and Pivotal Positions, including terms of employment, reward structure and benefits, 
with the aim to attract, retain and motivate, as well as maintaining and administering remuneration entitlements of the NEDs. 
NRC also supports the Board in ensuring the efficiency and transparency of board governance matters, primarily on BEE, the 
Board Performance Improvement Programme and Board Operations management, including other matters as directed by the 
Board.

Under Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main LR of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa 
Securities), the Board of Directors of listed issuers is required to include in their annual 
report a statement about the state of risk management and internal control of the listed 
issuer as a group.
TM’s Board of Directors (“Board”) is pleased to provide the following statement that has been prepared in accordance with the Statement 
on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed issuers endorsed by Bursa Securities, which outlines the nature 
and scope of the risk management and internal control within TM Group during the financial year under review. SORMIC is jointly endorsed 
by the BRC and Board Audit Committee (BAC).
The Board
The Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group’s risk management framework and internal control systems, guided 
by the Group’s risk appetite to ensure alignment within acceptable tolerance levels. This aims to achieve the Group’s goals and objectives 
in generating returns for shareholders. The Board periodically reviews the effectiveness and adequacy of the framework and systems by 
identifying, assessing, monitoring and communicating key risks to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets.
RESPONSIBILITY & ACCOUNTABILITY
The two (2) Board committees that have primary risk management and internal control oversight responsibilities are:
1   Bo ard Risk & Investment Committee 
(BRIC)
The primary responsibility of the BRIC is to 
assist the Board in ensuring a robust ERM 
framework and its effective implementation, 
thereby enhancing the Group’s corporate 
governance practices. This involves a 
concentrated focus on risk issues through the 
identification, assessment and monitoring of 
key business and investment risks. In 2023, 
recognising the growing importance of 
sustainability/ESG, as well as heightened risk 
profiles of Cyber Security, Regulatory Policy 
Shift, Mobile and IT and Digital Resilience, 
these subjects continue to take centre stage 
on the Board’s agenda. The BRIC serves as 
the oversight platform to engage in 
discussions concerning these risks and the 
associated control implementations.
The Terms of Reference (ToR) and primary 
duties of the BRIC concerning risk 
management are incorporated in the Board 
Charter, which is accessible on the company’s 
official website at www.tm.com.my.
2  Board Audit Committee (BAC)
The primary responsibility of the BAC is to assist the Board in assessing the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control structure and review of the financial 
reporting. To achieve this, the BAC:
 R eviews the Group’s internal control systems and management information 
systems’ adequacy and integrity, including compliance with applicable laws, 
rules, directives and guidelines through the Group Internal Audit (GIA) 
function.
 R eviews and provides oversight on the Group’s management of investigations 
and prosecutions, fraud and disciplinary issues, ethics, integrity principles and 
whistle-blowing processes through the Group Integrity & Governance (GIG) 
function.
 G IA and GIG report directly to the Board Audit Committee.
The BAC’s ToR is stipulated in the Board Charter, accessible on the company’s 
website. The primary duties of the BAC in assessing the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the internal control systems implemented within the Group are elaborated on 
pages 188 to 190.
Other Board Committees, such as the Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
(NRC) and Tender Committee, are also established with clearly defined duties and 
responsibilities to oversee various key business activities involved within the Group.
The Board acknowledges that it remains responsible for all the committees’ actions 
regarding the execution of the delegated roles, including the outcomes of the review 
and disclosure of key risks and internal control systems in this IAR.

Management is accountable to the Board and responsible for implementing the processes of identifying, evaluating, monitoring and 
reporting risks and the effectiveness of internal control systems, taking appropriate and timely corrective actions as required. The 
Management has assured the Board that the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are operating adequately and 
effectively in all material aspects, based on the ERM framework and internal control systems adopted by the Group. In respect of risk 
management, the Management has implemented the necessary processes to:
 Identify and analyse the risk appetite relevant to the business and determine the level of risk tolerance towards the achievement of 
the Group’s objectives and strategies;
 Design, implement and monitor the ERM framework according to the Group’s strategic vision and overall risk appetite; and
 Identify changes to risks or emerging risks, take appropriate actions and bring these promptly to the Board’s attention.
ERM Framework
ERM remains an integral part of the organisational governance processes, ensuring all inherent and emerging risks are assessed, 
mitigated and monitored to safeguard the Group’s interests.
TM has adopted the ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard, which serves as a guideline for identifying, evaluating, managing and 
monitoring significant risks by the Group to align its ERM process with industry best practices.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
The ERM practice has been progressively implemented throughout TM, including its subsidiaries, to support the execution of business 
strategies and operations.

TM’s ERM structure spans the entire organisation, from the Board to all levels of operations. Through such governance and framework, 
material risks are consolidated from all customer-facing business units to the MC and escalated up to the BRIC and Board. Applying a 
TM Group-wide perspective, leaders will evaluate, scrutinise, warrant further exploration and approve the top risks (including Principal 
Risks) through the BRIC platform.
There are appointed Risk Coordinators at every LoB, central function, business function, subsidiary and region/state. Their primary role is to 
lead the coordination of risk management activities with an aspiration to build a risk-based decision-making workforce, together with strong 
accountability and responsibility from the respective Heads of Divisions to ensure the discipline is successfully instituted. The outcome is 
reflected through the encouraging feedback from the 2023 TM’s Risk Maturity Survey. In all ERM activities, the importance of the staff’s role 
is always emphasised.
IR   F or more information on our Principal Risks, please see pages 230 to 231. 
TM Principal Risk Management Policy & Risk Appetite Statement
Established in 2005, TM’s Risk Management and Internal Control Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) emphasises TM’s commitment to 
a systematic and proactive approach to risk management practices. It provides reasonable assurance to achieve business objectives and 
highlights the responsibility and accountability relating to risk management. The Policy Statement was enhanced in 2021 to incorporate 
the Principal Risk Appetite Statement.
With this incorporation, it has been renamed “TM’s Principal Risk Management Policy and Risk Appetite Statement”, which aims to 
minimise risks and optimise opportunities in line with TM Group’s risk appetite. The statement is as stipulated below, including how this 
can be cascaded to the operational level.

Cascading the Principal Risk Appetite to Operational
TM Principal Risk Management Policy &  
Risk Appetite Statement
  TM Group is committed to deliver shareholder’s 
value through sustainable growth without 
compromising our integrity, ethical values and 
reputation by continuously upholding our brand 
promises, best customer experience, resilient 
network, compliance to regulatory requirements as 
well as ensuring a safe and healthy working 
environment for all TM’s workforce.
  TM Group will defend, improve and expand our 
market position in Malaysia and selected overseas 
locations through a good risk management discipline.
  TM Group shall assess and pursue new growth in 
tandem with the evolving industry and market 
conditions.
Operational
   Likelihood: Principal Risk appetite guides the 
determination of the risk occurrence’s probability by 
ensuring the risk assessments at the operational 
level align with the organisation’s tolerance level.
   Impact: The Principal Risk appetite guides the 
determination of the severity level of the impact 
parameter at the operational level.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges that the internal control systems are designed to manage and reduce risks that hinder the Group from achieving 
its goals and objectives. It provides reasonable assurance against any material misstatement of management, including financial 
information, business, operational, environmental, compliance and financial losses or fraud. The internal control systems are embedded 
within the Group’s operating activities and exist for fundamental business reasons.
These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The internal control systems are developed based on the COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission) 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. They are reviewed regularly throughout the year by the Board, considering any changes in 
regulation, applicable laws or the business environment to ensure the adequacy and integrity of the internal control systems.
Key elements of the internal control systems established by the Board that provide good governance and effective internal control 
systems that support the sustainability of the company are further elaborated below:
The Risk Appetite of TM is reviewed annually to ensure it is aligned to the strategic objectives of the company.
Principal Risks
The Principal Risks are based into five (5) categories: Strategic Risk, Financial Risk, Technology/System Risk, Operational Risk and 
Sustainability Risk. TM continuously reviews and updates the risks, including incorporating relevant emerging risks within the 
telecommunication industry to ensure relevance and adequate risk coverage. The risks are further prioritised based on their residual  
risk ratings, key risk indicators, key control indicators and risk outlooks. The Principal Risks monitored by the Board are listed on pages 
230 to 231.
Exposure to compliance risk is monitored through the Corporate Compliance Dashboard, with the potential and actual impact of  
non-compliance presented to the MC.
The BRIC and MC continue to provide oversight and appraise the adequacy and effectiveness of the ERM practices given the challenging 
operating environment.

Governance:
Clearly Defined Lines of Responsibility & Authority
The Group has clearly defined lines of responsibility and authority 
to facilitate prompt responses in the continuously evolving 
business environment, adequate supervision of day-to-day business 
conduct, timely resolution of audit issues and accountability of the 
internal controls. These include a formal organisation structure 
and establishing a Limit of Authority (LoA) matrix that clearly 
outlines the Board and Management’s limits and approval 
authorities across various key processes. The Board duly approves 
the LoA and subject to regular review and enhancement to ensure 
it reflects changes in accountability and the Group’s risk appetite.
Strategic Theme, Objectives & Core Values
Set to enable a Digital Malaysia, TM has a comprehensive suite of 
communication services and digital offerings to serve and

As Malaysia’s leading integrated Telco, TM has the strategic role 
of being the catalyst in shaping the nation’s economic growth, 
social inclusion and digital adoption. Carrying a dual role as a PLC 
and GLC, require TM to continue playing the balancing act. The 
primary focus is on long-term commercial sustainability, as it is 
important for TM to be financially reliable to continue as a 
strategic partner for nation building.
TM is consistently driven by stakeholder value creation and places 
high emphasis on delivering an enhanced customer experience in

profitability, increased operational efficiency, as well as productivity. 
Our initial transformation has set a solid foundation, edging TM 
towards becoming a TechCo company. The next phase for TM is 
to protect our leadership position in connectivity and embark on 
platform play to capture future opportunities. This is aligned with 
TM’s long-term aspiration to become a Digital Powerhouse by 
2030. As the future shapers of tomorrow and enabler of a Digital 
Malaysia, we continue driving Malaysia towards becoming a digital

The commitment to an ethical working environment is reflected in 
TM CBE. All TM employees are also committed to embracing 
KRISTAL core values, which includes total commitment to 
customers, uncompromising integrity and respect & care in our 
interactions, whether internal or external stakeholders.
Risk Management & Internal Control Policy Statement
The board and management issued our TM Principal Risk 
Management Policy and Risk Appetite Statement to provide 
reasonable assurance that the Group will achieve its business 
objectives, while safeguarding and enhancing shareholders’ 
investments and the Group’s assets. The Group CEO, Heads of 
LoBs, Heads of Business and Support Groups and TM subsidiaries’ 
CEOs are responsible for implementing the Enterprise Risk 
Management framework and practices.

oversee the business value creation related to product creation 
and management, especially cross-functional collaborations in 
creating values via product initiatives to support TM’s Vision.
Procurement Policy
Procurement policies, processes and guidelines are established to 
govern the procurement process, i.e., related activities in the 
procurement value chain, relevant authority limits and the 
stakeholders’ accountability, including TM’s employees and 
suppliers. The procurement governance in TM is made referencing 
the GLC Red Book (the primary procurement guideline for GLCs 
launched in 2006 under the GLC Transformation Programme) on 
Procurement Guidelines and Best Practices. The three (3) objectives 
of the Red Book are to drive value creation for the nation, develop 
a robust and competitive Bumiputera Commercial and Industrial 
Community (BCIC), minimise graft, increase corporate transparency 
and enhance corporate governance. TM’s procurement activities 
are driven by the 5R: Right Quality, Right Quantity, Right Time, 
Right Place and Right Price.
Policy, Manual & Procedures
TM’s Business Policy & Governance (BPG) is the primary reference 
document that outlines the overall business policies and 
governance with clearly defined process owners across key 
functional areas within the Group. The sub-policies, processes, 
procedures and guidelines are developed, periodically reviewed 
and maintained by the respective process owners to provide the 
details in supporting the overall policies and governance in BPG.
Insurance & physical safeguards
Adequate insurance and physical safeguards for significant assets 
are in place to ensure the Group’s assets are sufficiently covered 
to minimise material loss against any mishap.
Corporate Committees
Three (3) Corporate Committees, namely the Management 
Committee (MC), Business Operations Council (BOC) and 
Technology Committee (TechCom), were established to provide 
timely guidance and decisions in their respective scope and focus. 
The demarcation of roles is clearly defined, with specific authority 
levels assigned to ensure effective and efficient business execution 
balancing with control.
MC focuses on strategic and policy matters, while BOC and 
TechCom concentrate on operational performance, execution and 
deployment in areas of business and technology.
Best Practice Committee (BPC)
BPC is a Management Committee that reports to the BAC. The 
BPC serves as a platform to review, update and discuss 
developments in listed issuer compliance, policies, best practices, 
corporate governance and changes in statutory and regulatory 
requirements set by the relevant regulatory authorities and 
statutory bodies.

Led by the Chief Corporate and Regulatory Officer (CCRO), a dedicated 
function focuses on the overall sustainability management in TM, 
including planning and executing sustainability programmes across 
TM. We have integrated sustainability-related risks as part of our 
group-wide ERM to expand our horizon further for a holistic view of 
ERM in the organisation. With structured sustainability management 
and risk framework in place, TM progressively assesses the emerging 
sustainability risks such as carbon emission, supply chain, labour 
standard, customer experience & privacy, safety & health and social 
well-being, with a focus given on environmental, particularly climate 
change risk. Starting in 2021, TM started to alleviate the climate 
change risk as part of Principal Risks monitored by BRIC. 
We continue our progressive effort in optimising our opportunities 
in the sustainability agenda while at the same time minimising 
related risks. During the year, as part of our key improvement 
areas in sustainability, we revised our framework and roadmap, 
which detailed our latest execution plan for 2024 to 2026, tapping 
into the opportunities of enabling sustainable growth for our 
customers and community while ensuring resilience within TM’s 
our value chain. The Sustainability Committee, comprising of key 
members of the top management, has been appointed to oversee 
the implementation of TM’s Sustainability Framework and 
Integration Plan. Details of the framework and integration plan are 
as per the Sustainability chapter from page 86 to 89.
Integrity:
The Group’s commitment to upholding integrity in carrying out its 
duties is evidenced by:
TM Code of Conduct & Business Ethics (CBE) &  
Anti-Corruption Guide (ACG)
TM is committed to conducting business in an open, honest and 
ethical manner. Our CBE and TM ACG have always been the 
primary reference for all employees when dealing with various 
internal and external stakeholders. TM CBE is also highlighting the 
Anti-Corruption Policy, Provision 13, which focuses on the TM 
zero-tolerance approach against all forms of corruption and our 
top-level commitment to ensuring the approach is being 
implemented in TM.
 
TM ACG, which supplements the CBE, sets out the policy statements 
and guidelines for all TM employees concerning improper solicitation, 
bribery, or other corrupt activities and issues that may arise in the 
course of conducting business. In view of the provisions of Section 
17A, Corporate Liability of MACC Act 2009, our controls and initiatives 
are implemented based on the T.R.U.S.T Principles. This is to ensure 
that TM has adequate control to conduct its business with integrity 
and eradicate corrupt practices. 
Awareness & Briefing Sessions
Ongoing awareness and briefing sessions on CBE and Corporate 
Liability Section 17(A) are essential for TM employees to have 
sufficient knowledge and understanding of CBE. This includes a 
strong understanding of Corporate Liability Provision Section 17A 
of MACC Act 2009, which has been enforced since 1 June 2020. 
More than 7,300 employees have attended the awareness session, 
which includes both physical and virtual, for the year 2023. In 
2023, GIG has also issued 26 awareness snippets on the 
understanding of TM CBE with a sample of scenarios/case 
studies. 
Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP)
The OACP is positioned as a new initiative to strengthen controls 
& monitoring of Corruption, Integrity & Governance risks and as a 
defence towards compliance with Section 17A of MACC Act 2009. 
TM adopted the framework from the Institute Integrity of Malaysia 
by analysing and interpreting data from multiple sources internally 
& externally, defining the corruption-related risks and understanding 
the root causes based on the TM ERM framework adopted from 
the ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Guidelines. The scope 
covered 20 divisions from various LoBs and support functions. 
The corruption risk assessment results were further analysed to 
focus on the moderate or higher risks. A total of 91 action plans 
were generated based on corruption risk assessments with 20 
divisions in 2021. However, in 2023, 103 action plans have been 
generated based on corruption risk assessment undertaken by the 
divisions in TM. For 2023, we managed to achieve a completion 
rate of 82% over five (5) years.

Directors’ Statement on Risk 
Management & Internal Controls

---- Page 227 ----
GIA is an in-house internal audit function that reports to the BAC to provide risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight 
designed to enhance and protect organisational value. GIA helps the Group accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined 
approach to evaluating and improving ERM effectiveness, control and governance processes. During the financial year, the internal audit 
function provided continuous assurance on matters related to governance and internal controls. It further evaluated the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the governance, ERM framework and internal control systems and provided recommendations for improvement. The 
Management then followed through and reviewed the status of actions taken on the internal auditors’ recommendations.
Audit reviews are carried out on units identified through a risk-based approach, in line with the Group’s objectives and policies in the 
context of its evolving business and regulatory environment, with input from the senior management and the Board.
IR   F urther information on Internal Audit is provided on pages 227 to 229 of this IAR.
INTERNAL AUDIT
TM CBE e-Learning
In ensuring comprehensive coverage of reaching out to the overall 
population in TM and taking advantage of technology in line with 
Digital Malaysia, GIG has rolled out an e-Learning programme known 
as TM CBE e-Learning. This programme has been designed and 
developed to address how employees should demonstrate the value 
of integrity in their daily work via interactive learning videos and 
messages based on real case scenarios. More than 18,000 employees 
have completed this e-Learning exercise for the Phase 2 in 2023. 
TM Integrity Day 2023
To demonstrate its commitment and continuous effort to uphold 
high integrity, governance and transparency in its business 
operations, TM organised its annual TM Integrity Day 2023 (TMID) 
on 1 November 2023, in conjunction with the National Integrity Day. 
The key highlights of TMID include a special forum featuring 
prominent speakers and a special theatre performance on corruption 
and its impact. This event is attended by the TM BOD, Chairman, 
GCEO, Management, Warga TM and Business Partners nationwide 
via this Hybrid event. 
MS ISO 37001: 2016 Anti-Bribery Management System 
(ABMS)
TM has adopted MS ISO 37001, an international anti-bribery 
management system standard, to help our organisation implement, 
maintain and improve the anti-bribery compliance programme to 
prevent, detect and respond to occurrences of corrupt practices. 
TM have appointed 18 coordinators to oversee their respective 
divisions and trained 52 lead auditors to maintain the ABMS 
effectively. TM has maintained our MS ISO 37001:2016 ABMS 
certification since 2021, which shows our commitment to good 
governance and integrity. Currently, high corruption risk processes 
under seven (7) divisions nationwide (Unifi, TM One, TM Global, 
Group Procurement, GNT, GITD and Support Business) have been 
certified under the ABMS scope.
Declaration of Assets & Interest (DOA) & Integrity  
Pledge (IP)
Annual DOA and IP are important to ensure transparency in TM’s 
daily business dealings and to avoid any conflict of interest. This is 
one of the many initiatives that TM has put in place to build a 
culture of integrity throughout the organisation. In 2023, 100% of TM 
Employees had completed the DOA and IP. The declaration of 
interest includes the employees’ declaration of any employment or 
business outside TM and a declaration of their family members’ 
involvement in business dealings with TM or who work or provide 
services to TM’s competitor. This DOA exercise is in compliance 
with the provision stipulated under the TM CBE.
Whistle-Blowing Policy
TM and its BOD are committed to whistle-blowing policy, which 
enables any employee, supplier or other third party to report actual 
or suspected malpractice, misconduct or violation of the Group’s 
policies and regulations safely and confidentially through TM 
Ethics Line.
Integrity, Governance & Anti-Corruption Award
In 2023, TM won the Highest Gold Award at the Anugerah Integriti, 
Governans dan Antirasuah 2023 (AIGA 2023). Additionally, TM has 
been awarded the anti-corruption accolade by UNGC (United 
Nations Global Compact) on November 2023. TM’s achievements 
underscore a steadfast commitment to transparency, accountability 
and creating an ethical corporate culture guided by the TM CBE.

Risk Maturity Framework 2023
The TM Risk Maturity Assessment 2023 (TMRMA 2023) plays a vital role in our ERM framework towards ensuring the adequacy and 
effectiveness of our ERM and internal control systems. The TMRMA aims to achieve the following objectives:
•
 Und
erstanding the current risk management maturity level within the organisation
•
 Id
entifying areas where TM can improve risk management processes
•
 P
roviding business assurance in meeting organisational targets/goals
•
 Ena
bling more informed decisions about risk and integrated analytics to manage opportunities as well as potential negative impacts
Spearheaded by the Group Risk Management (GRM), this assessment actively engages key stakeholders, including selected Directors, 
Heads of Divisions and risk coordinators across the organisation.
Risk Maturity Results
An initiative to gauge our Risk Maturity level and benchmarking was conducted with an appointed consultant from September to 
December 2023 involving interviews with selected Directors and TM leaders, survey and validation with the GRM and risk coordinators. 
The assessment was conducted in accordance with the consultant’s risk maturity framework, covering the following nine (9) components. 
Overview of Risk Maturity results summarised in the following illustration:
TM Risk Maturity Result 2023: Level 3 
Interview & Survey Participation by TM Leaders: 100%
High-level commitment Executive leadership Transparent risk communication
Culture of risk ownership Data & analytics Stakeholder participation
Risk-based decision-making Risk quantification Optimised risk profile
The Board has received assurance from the GCEO and GCFO that the Group’s risk management framework and internal control systems 
are operating adequately during the financial year under review. Taking into consideration the Management’s assurance and input from 
the relevant assurance providers, the Board is of the view that the risk management framework and internal control systems are 
satisfactory and adequate to safeguard shareholders’ investments, customers’ interests and the Group’s assets and have not resulted in 
any material loss, contingency or uncertainty. TM’s internal control systems do not apply to its associate companies, which fall within 
their majority shareholders’ control.
Nonetheless, TM’s interests are served through representation on the BOD and senior management posting(s) to the various subsidiaries 
and through the review of management accounts received. These provide the Board with performance-related information to enable 
informed and timely decision-making on the Group’s investments in such companies.
As required by Paragraph 15.23 of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Main Market Listing Requirements, the external auditors have 
reviewed this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Controls. Their limited assurance review was performed following the 
Malaysian Approved Standard on Assurance Engagements, ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information and Audit and Assurance Practice Guide 3, Guidance for Auditors on Engagements to Report on the 
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control included in the Annual Report issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. 
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control systems of the Group.

Group Internal Audit (GIA) supports TM Group in achieving its business objectives by implementing 
a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, 
risk management and control processes. GIA provides independent and objective assurance and 
consulting services to enhance and protect organisational value. The internal audit charter 
approved by the BAC defines GIA’s purpose, authority and responsibility. 
GIA, headed by the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA), reports directly to the BAC to preserve its independence and objectivity while ensuring 
audit personnel are free from any relationships or conflicts of interest that could impair their objectivity and independence. The CIA has 
an administrative reporting line to the GCEO, which enables the requisite stature and authority of Internal Audit to fulfil its responsibilities. 
The CIA’s detailed background can be found in this annual report’s “Profile of Senior Management” section. 
BAC reviews and approves GIA’s annual audit plans, budget and human resources requirements to ensure resources with the relevant 
competencies are sufficient to carry out audit functions aligned with the Group’s objectives. The CIA periodically reports on the activities 
performed by the GIA as well as key strategic and control issues to the BAC. In addition to the above, the BAC approves and reviews 
GIA’s and the CIA’s performance to observe their progress and achievements.
PRACTICES & FRAMEWORK
GIA is guided by the internal policies, procedures and framework, as well as the Internal Control Framework of the COSO and Control 
Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) in assessing and reporting the adequacy and effectiveness of the design, 
implementation and efficiency of the Group’s overall internal control system, risk management and governance.
GIA adopts the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF)® and its mandatory elements, including the Core Principles for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of the Institute of 
Internal Auditors (IIA), the definition of Internal Auditing and Code of Ethics to effectively and efficiently execute the audit engagements.
SCOPE & COVERAGE
GIA continues to adopt a risk-based audit plan approach in formulating the annual audit plan, considering TM‘s strategic objectives, risk 
profiling and inputs from the BAC and Senior Management. This is to provide independent assurance to the Board that the audit plans 
are prioritised based on the Group’s strategies, objectives and key risk areas. 
GIA focused on seven (7) key audit areas  covering the business value chain,  in line with TM’s direction and  risks. Among the key areas 
reviewed during FY2023 are:

Statement of Internal Audit

---- Page 230 ----
Based on a total of 48 audits carried out in FY2023, among the 
key risks identified are: 
 The  strategy, planning, development and management 
of key products from the three (3) LoBs i.e. Unifi, TM 
One and TM Global
 Th
e ecosystem that drives the revenue and cost 
management within the LoBs includes the team setup 
effectiveness, sales management, sales campaigns, 
partners’ appointments and management
 The deliver
y and management of TM’s main projects 
and services, which include the processes, systems, 
network infrastructure and people capabilities
 Gover
nance and compliance to assess the adherence 
and improvement needed on key areas within the 
financial-Capex spending, procurement, workforce, 
license management and cyber security matters
All internal audit reports with significant improvement opportunities 
were presented to the BAC for deliberation, while others were 
reported in the quarterly reporting to the BAC. Each audit issue is 
supported by GIA recommendations and the relevant feedback 
from the Management was obtained for issue closure. As part of 
the audit process, GIA continuously monitors and validates the 
implementation of the management action to address the audit 
issues on a monthly basis. 
In providing value to the organisation, GIA’s key performance 
indicators include key contributions and value-adding 
recommendations to the Management in the form of cost 
avoidance, opportunity loss, cost optimisation, income realisation, 
revenue recovery, cost reduction and significant process 
improvements identified during audit engagements.
INTERNAL AUDIT QUALITY
The CIA develops and maintains a Quality Assurance and 
Improvement Programme that covers all aspects of internal audit 
activities. The quality assurance programme assesses the efficiency 
and effectiveness of GIA processes and identifies opportunities for 
improvement via internal and external assessments.
As part of its Quality Assurance, GIA maintains a 3-tier quality 
review mechanism to ensure relevant, reliable and sufficient 
assessment to support audit engagement results and conclusions. 
Audit reports are prepared by the respective GIA Head of Units, 
reviewed by the Deputy Chief Internal Auditors, with final review 
and approval by the CIA. This assurance review process ensures 
that the internal auditors adequately assess all risk areas before 
communicating the final engagement results to the Management 
and BAC.
GIA has fully utilised the Audit Management System (AMS) named 
Pentana. Pentana provides systematic audit work documentation 
and task tracking. The GIA internal analytics platform (ADEPT) is 
being applied to enable analytic-based audits as part of the audit 
fieldwork. This ADEPT was developed internally by Credence.
In maintaining the quality of audit work, GIA ensures that all audits 
conform to the Internal Audit IPPF standards. The IPPF was 
incorporated into the GIA Audit Manual, established for internal 
auditors to follow, where regular compliance reviews were conducted 
to ensure that internal audits complied with the Audit Manual. 
The effectiveness and quality of the internal audit activities are 
also assessed externally by the Institute of Internal Auditor 
Malaysia (IIAM) via the External Quality Assessment Review 
(EQAR). Pursuant to the review, IIAM opined that the overall final 
opinion “Generally Conforms” to the Standards. GIA has fulfilled its 
key objectives in accordance with the IIA’s International Standards 
for the IPPF. 
In addition to conformance to the standard, GIA was noted to be 
generally operating at “Managed” levels against the Internal Audit 
Maturity Assessment (IAMA) framework. The matrix consists of 
five (5) levels, i.e. Initial, Defined, Implemented, Managed and 
Optimised. 
This indicates that GIA manages reasonably well in meeting 
governance objectives, ensuring audit plans are risk-based and 
periodically reviewed, putting in place adequate policies and 
procedures, using audit management systems and data analytic 
tools in performing audits, supervising work quality, communicating 
audit results, following up on audit issues and reporting to Audit 
Committee on the implementation status, applying and declaring 
adherence to IIA’s code of ethics.

intain corporate membership status in IIA Malaysia, which provides access to internal auditors for training, reading materials, 
audit resources and current happenings in the audit fraternity
GIA continuously encourages auditors to equip themselves with sufficient knowledge and skills to demonstrate a high level of proficiency 
and due professional care in fulfilling auditors’ responsibilities. In 2023, the internal auditors attended 2,340 hours of external and internal 
online training in multiple technical disciplines and professional certification programmes to enhance their job performance and career 
prospects.
GIA continues to strengthen its processes and approach to ensure comprehensive audit coverage. Key strategies implemented by GIA 
include workforce realignment and continuous upskilling of auditors. The GIA organisation structure is portfolio-focused, which supports 
talent development within GIA and enables the auditors to have adequate exposure to performing audits across the entire TM value chain.

MANAGING UNCERTAINTIES IN OUR BUSINESS 
TM Risk Landscape 2023 comprises of eight (8) Principal Risks, as well as external and internal factors that may directly or indirectly 
impact the organisation. The landscape provides perspective on managing uncertainties within our business. At its core, the Principal 
Risks guide board-level decisions and shape our enterprise strategy. Surrounding this core are risks stemming from external and internal 
factors that are continually monitored for their potential to escalate into corporate-level concerns.
The external and internal factors, primarily economic shifts, regulatory dynamics, market landscapes, global sentiments and sustainability 
obligations, serve as our early warning system. This facilitates foresight and navigation through the ever-evolving external environment, 
ensuring our continuous alignment with business objectives while remaining vigilant in navigating uncertainties toward sustainable growth 
and resilience.

On the business front, TM prioritised improvements in the Mobile 
sector by closely monitoring risks related to quality and coverage 
to enhance customer experience and leverage 4G and 5G 
capabilities. 
Our strategic focus on brand and customer experience is evidenced 
by innovations aligned with the JENDELA plan, ensuring broader 
coverage and enhanced broadband experiences. Throughout 2023, 
despite the intense competition among service providers, we 
continued our unwavering dedication to providing attractive offers. 
Unifi Pakej RAHMAH was launched in line with the Government’s 
goal of enhancing digital inclusivity by providing affordable access. 
It contributes to increased accessibility and affordability while 
reinforcing our commitment to customer-centric solutions.
Continuing our convergence agenda and recognising the 
digitalisation of TM’s business, caution prevailed amidst emerging 
uncertainties. This encompassed concerns about data privacy and 
protection, cyber threats, adaptation to the digital revolution, 
changing market demands, regulatory dynamics and the  
increasing impacts of climate change risk. These challenges are 
directly aligned with TM’s material matters, identified through 
comprehensive stakeholder engagement and are integral to our 
Group Sustainability Framework. TM incorporated strategic actions 
into operational plans, emphasising ESG considerations, including 
efforts to reduce carbon emissions from our operations as 
detailed in our Sustainability Report on pages 126 to 131.
In 2023, TM pioneered industry growth through digital innovation 
and sustainability, advancing toward the envisioned milestone of 
transforming into a Digital Powerhouse by 2030. TM aspires to 
harness cutting-edge technologies to make significant progress in 
the digital landscape, positioning Malaysia as the regional digital 
hub. Our strategic focus extends beyond connectivity, as we set 
our sights on shaping the future of technology on a global stage.
Our ESG initiatives not only provide a competitive edge but also 
deliver tangible benefits to customers, employees, investors and 
stakeholders. In the current economic recovery phase, TM 
showcases agility in response to market dynamics, evolving 
customer needs and regulatory shifts. Our shareholders highly 
value our dedication to competitiveness, risk resilience and seizing 
opportunities. As we navigate the changing landscape, our 
unwavering focus is on sustaining growth, fostering innovation and 
creating lasting value for all stakeholders, aligning seamlessly with 
our vision for the future.
Looking ahead, Group Risk Management (GRM) is enhancing how 
we handle risks, not only in day-to-day operations but also in 
strategic projects and investments. This fortifies our base for the 
future and echoes with the formation of BRIC to supersede the 
current BRC starting January 2024.

BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS (BIA) PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR EFFECTIVE BUSINESS CONTINUITY EXECUTION
A resilient organisation is one that can pre-empt and adapt to change, regardless of whether it is a planned change or a sudden change. 
With change also comes opportunities, so it is about understanding the wider benefits that a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) can provide 
to the organisation. it is a critical component of an organisation’s risk management and business continuity planning process. Regular 
reviews of key BIA are essential to ensure that it remains up-to-date and aligned with the evolving business environment. It is important 
to take a holistic view and understand how a major change or incident can affect the operation of TM’s business, our customers and 
potentially their customers. In a world of digital transformation, where so many companies are interconnected and dependent on each 
other, it is important that the BIA also take external factors as a consideration.
The BIA stands as a pivotal component of TM’s BCM framework. A total of 13 registered BIAs are planned throughout 2023, covering 
the scope of our BCM key pillars, which include Network Connectivity and Mobile, IT & Information Security, Customer Touchpoint, Civil, 
Mechanical and Electrical (CME) Infrastructure and Commercial Building and Procurement & Logistic Operation. The objective of 
conducting the BIA is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how potential disruptions could impact various facets of our business 
operations. Through meticulous evaluation of critical processes, dependencies and resources, our goal at TM is to identify vulnerabilities 
and prioritise areas for required mitigations. 
This proactive approach is designed to equip TM with the necessary tools to navigate challenges, minimise downtime and uphold a high 
service continuity. The desired outcome extends beyond mere resilience; we aim for an improved capacity to respond swiftly and 
effectively to unforeseen events, thereby safeguarding our reputation and instilling confidence among stakeholders.

As a testament to our commitment to operational resilience, TM significantly emphasises regular testing and simulation exercises for our 
BCP and DRP. Internally, these exercises involve the active participation of key stakeholders across various departments, ensuring a 
comprehensive evaluation of response mechanisms and the effectiveness of our strategies. External stakeholders, including partners and 
regulatory bodies, are also engaged in selected simulations to enhance coordination and strengthen the collective resilience of the entire 
ecosystem.

 In our pursuit of ope
rational excellence, TM systematically executes BCP & DRP testing and simulation exercises, engaging both 
internal and external stakeholders. A notable highlight in this commitment was the recent DR Simulation Drill exercise conducted in 
Bagan Pasir, Perak, from 12 to 13 October 2023.
 
 Th
e exercise was focused on validating the operational readiness of our CoW and DRE Service Cabin units. Positioned as operational 
hubs during crises, these mobile units showcased their capabilities in real-time communication, decision-making and resource 
coordination. This hands-on mobilisation exercise not only served to test the efficiency of our Disaster Recovery team's response 
but also confirmed the seamless integration of these units with our broader BCP and DRP strategies.
 
 Th
e objective of the DR Simulation Drill exercise is to ensure TM’s readiness for deployment of DRE Service Cabin and CoW during 
disasters or crises as part of the Business Continuity Strategy Plan led by GNT and TM State Operation Centre (TSOC) Perak.
In line with the TCFD recommendations in addressing the climate risk, BCM is covering the Physical Risk such as direct damage to 
assets and property caused by natural calamity. TM continue to assess and review climate related risks in managing the physical 
risk brought forth by the climate change, hence we continue to strengthen our BCP & DRP execution to sustain and strengthen our 
operational resiliency.

2. 2 023 National Comprehensive Security Exercise (EX-COMSEC) Seminar & Tabletop Exercise (TTX)
 
 Th
e Government of Malaysia has recognised TM as one of the Critical National Infrastructures (CNI) by virtue of it being one of the 
key players for essential services in the telecommunication sector. As such, TM aligned itself with the Government’s commitment 
towards national security preparedness, which is led by the National Security Council (MKN). In 2023, TM participated in the 
inaugural cross-agency/cross-industry EX-COMSEC organised by MKN towards readiness in managing national level security threats. 
The overview of EX-COMSEC and what it meant for TM is depicted in the following diagramme:
Figure 2: TM’s participation in the cross-agency/cross-industry EX-COMSEC organised by MKN
The EX-COMSEC initiated by the MKN was held from 14 - 17 November 2023. Professional Sharing sessions by speakers from MKN, 
PDRM, ATM, NRC, APM, JPeN and GLCs (PETRONAS, TM & TNB) have provided insights on terrorism, public order threats crises and 
crisis management handling. 255 participants from various Federal and State Governments (35 agencies/authorities) were involved with 
PETRONAS, TM and TNB appointed as strategic partners.

Representing a significant milestone as Malaysia’s first National-scale exercise, EX-COMSEC stands as a 
pivotal event designed to enhance better coordination and crisis communication, emergency response 
capabilities among various Government inter-agencies, GLCs and communities in managing national security 
crises.
Figure 5: The closing ceremony of EX-COMSEC 2023 was graced by the Director General of National Security Council (MKN)
Figure 6: After-Action Review (AAR) Meeting for Post TTX Implementation review
Post EX-COMSEC 2023 TTX event, an After-Action Review (AAR) meeting was conducted to debrief the TTX 
outcomes in order to facilitate learning and continuous improvement by identifying what worked well, what 
could be improved and how to apply the lessons learnt for future TTX/FTX activities planned for 2024. 
Beyond its immediate impact, the exercise provides TM with a unique opportunity to refine and improve its 
Business Continuity Plan. Additionally, it serves as a platform for upskilling our team, equipping them to 
effectively address potential national-level threats. TM’s active involvement in EX-COMSEC not only 
underscores our commitment to national security interest but also reinforces our credibility with key 
stakeholders, ensuring our ongoing contribution to the resilience and preparedness of the nation.

CRITICAL NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CNI) & TM’S CRITICAL KEYPOINT PROTECTION SEMINAR 
& AWARENESS
Building upon the momentum of our commitment to national security, TM orchestrated a seminar on the CNI 
and TM Keypoint Protection on 27 February 2023. This seminar and awareness event represented a 
concerted effort to refine and elevate the management and compliance requirements of National Keypoint 
(i.e. Sasaran Penting) related regulations, directives and acts.
Figure 7: Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) and Keypoint Protection Seminar & Awareness Session
TM continues to drive improvement of its BCM programmes whilst embedding business continuity as part of 
TM’s culture. Being at the forefront of telecommunication technology evolution of the nation and providing 
connectivity to millions of Malaysians, business continuity management and its discipline have become even 
more important for TM as we progress towards becoming a Digital Powerhouse by 2030. TM remains 
committed to providing reliable quality service to its customers, ensuring that national security and essential 
services continue to operate in the face of national-level crises or disasters attributed to aggressive climate 
change or man-made impacts. By addressing TM’s business continuity matters, the Group can create better 
stakeholder value, manage associated risks and opportunities and create positive economic, environmental 
and social impacts for sustainable growth.
Moving Forward
In addition to providing a platform for TM personnel to gain insights, the programme also included 
Professional Sharing sessions by reputable speakers from relevant authorities (e.g. the National Security 
Council (MKN), the Chief Government Security Officer (CGSO), the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA), 
the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) and the MCMC.
TM's proactive effort in organising this seminar and awareness programme reflects our unwavering 
commitment to continuously improve the national security protocols. This includes our commitment to 
regularly review and assess control effectiveness at the designated Critical Keypoint sites to ensure the 
compliance requirements are being fulfilled, hence strengthening our commitment to fortify and safeguard 
TM’s interest, which can lead to a significant impact on economic, defence, security or disruption to 
Government functions at the national level.

To Board of Directors, Stakeholders, and Interested Parties,
SIRIM QAS International Sdn Bhd was engaged by Telekom Malaysia Berhad (hereafter referred to as Telekom Malaysia) to perform an 
independent verification and provide assurance of Telekom Malaysia Sustainability Statement 2023. The main objective of the verification 
process is to provide assurance to Telekom Malaysia and its stakeholders on the accuracy and reliability of the information as presented 
in this statement. The verification by SIRIM QAS International applied to sustainable performance information (subject matter) within the 
assurance scope which is included in Telekom Malaysia Sustainability Statement 2023.
The management of Telekom Malaysia was responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Statement. The objective and impartiality 
of this statement is assured as no member of the verification team and no other employee of SIRIM QAS International was involved in 
the preparation of any part of the Telekom Malaysia’s Sustainability Statement, and Integrated Annual Report 2023.
The assurance engagement was designed to provide limited assurance in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and BURSA 
Sustainability Reporting Guide, irrespective of the organization’s ability to achieve its objectives, targets or expectations on their subject 
matter and sustainability-related issues. The assurance activity evaluates the adequacy of Telekom Malaysia Sustainability Statement and 
its overall presentation against respective frameworks such as UN-SDGs, GRI Standards requirement, TCFD and other relevant frameworks. 
The assurance process involves verification of 14 material matters as presented in the Sustainability Statement as follows i.e., Innovation 
& Technology, Customer Experience, Network Quality & Stability, Affordability & Inclusion, Community Development, Environmental Quality, 
Carbon Emissions, Fair & Transparent Employment, Health & Safety, Learning & Development, Sustainable Supply Chain, Responsible 
Communication, Cyber Security and Good Governance. Details are provided in Appendix 1.
The verification was carried out by SIRIM QAS International in February 2024 to March 2024, with the following methodologies:
•
 R
eviewing and verifying the traceability, consistency and accuracy of information collected from various sources; internal and external 
documentation which are made available during the conduct of assessment. 
•
 V
erification of data presented in the Sustainability Statement includes a detailed check of the sampled data. 
•
 Inte
rviewing key personnel responsible for collating information and writing various parts of the report to substantiate the veracity of 
the claims.
The verification process was subjected to the following limitations:
•
 Th
e scope of work did not involve verification of other information reported in Telekom Malaysia Integrated Annual Report 2023.
•
 Th
e corporate office, TM HQ at Cyberjaya was visited as part of this assurance engagement. The verification process did not include 
physical inspections of any of Telekom Malaysia’s buildings and offices. And,
•
 Th
e verification team did not verify any contractor or third-party data.
Conclusion
SIRIM QAS International, a Conformity Assessment Body in Malaysia, is accredited to both ISO/IEC 17021-1:2015 and ISO/IEC 17065:2012 
covering all our operational activities. The appointed assessors performing the assurance engagement were selected appropriately based 
on our internal qualifications, training and experience. The verification process is reviewed by management to ensure that the approach 
and assurance are strictly followed and operated transparently. During the verification process, issues were raised, and clarifications were 
sought from the management of Telekom Malaysia relating to the accuracy of some of the information contained in the report. In 
response to the raised findings, the Sustainability Statement was subsequently reviewed and revised by Telekom Malaysia. It is confirmed 
that changes that have been incorporated into the final version of the report have satisfactorily addressed all issues. Based on the scope 
of the assessment process and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Telekom Malaysia 
has not complied, in all material respects, with the referred assurance standard and guide. The following represents SIRIM QAS 
International’s opinion:
•
 Th
e level of data accuracy included in Telekom Malaysia Sustainability Statement 2023 is fairly stated;
• T
he level of disclosure of the specific sustainability performance information presented in the report was found to be properly 
prepared;
•
 Th
e personnel responsible were able to demonstrate the origin(s) and interpretation of data contained in the report;
•
 Th
e Sustainability Statement offers a reasonable and balanced presentation of Telekom Malaysia’s sustainability performance.

tion and interaction with external auditor; and

Company for the financial year 2024.
8.3
