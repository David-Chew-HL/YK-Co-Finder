COVER RATIONALE
Our cover design commemorates Malakoff Group’s 50th anniversary, marking five 
decades of growth, resilience and transformation. The bold “50” visual paired with 
dynamic wave patterns reflects both celebration and forward momentum. Within 
the design, a curated collage highlights Malakoff’s role as Malaysia’s largest green 
energy and environmental solutions provider — showcasing renewable energy 
initiatives such as solar power, sustainable waste management and biodiversity 
preservation.
The design aligns seamlessly with the tagline “Transforming Energy for 
Sustainable Growth” reinforces the Group’s commitment to delivering cleaner, 
more sustainable energy solutions. The blend of green and blue tones, natural 
imagery, and modern design elements together symbolise Malakoff’s journey 
towards a low-carbon future — championing innovation while ensuring long-term 
environmental and community impact. The colour pallette also draws inspiration 
from Malakoff’s three key business pillars – Malakoff Green Solutions, Malakoff 
Environmental Solutions and Malakoff Energy – visually grounding the Group’s 
integrated role in shaping a sustainable energy ecosystem.

Malakoff’s Sustainability Approach Guiding Principles 
Aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) in areas where we can create the most impact, we have 
identified 13 priority UN SDGs, to which our material matters, policies and programmes are aligned to. Our business operations are 
anchored in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) themes. These principles dictate how we operate and grow, enabling us to 
embed sustainability into every aspect of our business while driving long-term resilience. 
Following our Malakoff 2.0 rebranding initiative, which reflects a shift towards greener operations as we transition from a conventional 
energy producer to a lower-carbon energy mix organisation, we are accelerating renewable energy (RE) ventures, expanding 
sustainable environmental solutions to support the circular economy and reducing the carbon footprint of power generation.

Recognising that different stakeholders prioritise material 
matters differently, we actively engage with diverse stakeholder 
groups to understand their expectations and needs. By aligning 
our strategy with these insights, we focus on delivering 
economic, environmental and social value while upholding strong 
governance standards. Through this approach, we aim to create 
a lasting, positive impact in Malaysia and globally, ensuring long-
term success and sustainability. 
Sustainability advocacy remains central to our approach as we 
embed ESG principles into our operations, ensuring continuous 
progress toward long-term value creation. We also recognise 
that advancing sustainability requires more than setting goals, as 
it demands continuous integration of sustainable practices into 
our business model. To drive meaningful progress, we actively 
participate in key sustainability platforms and ESG conferences, 
fostering collaboration among stakeholders to address pressing 
issues such as climate change and risks. These engagements 
are central to delivering our Net Zero Roadmap, strengthening 
frameworks and policies that support a multi-sector transition to 
a low-carbon future.
We work closely with industry partners, regulatory bodies and 
non-governmental organisations to encourage the broader 
adoption of sustainable development principles. Through these 
partnerships, we exchange best practices, refine tools and 
enhance industry-wide sustainability standards. As part of this 
commitment, we became a member of the UN Global Compact 
Network Malaysia & Brunei (UNGCMYB), a leading voluntary 
initiative that promotes responsible business practices in Malaysia 
and Brunei. Additionally, we are targeting to register and become 
a member of the Malaysian Carbon Market Association, a non-
profit organisation that facilitates the development of Malaysia’s 
carbon market, further reinforcing our role in advancing climate 
action.
We remain committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and 
productive workplace while engaging with communities to 
drive meaningful outcomes. These efforts are anchored in 
strong corporate governance, guided by the Malaysian Code on 
Corporate Governance and the Main Market Listing Requirements 
issued by Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. 
As the country’s first independent power producer to join the 
United Nations Global Compact, we continue to uphold its ten 
universally accepted principles across environment, human 
rights, labour standards and anti-corruption. By embedding these 
principles into our operations, we strengthen our governance 
frameworks and advance key programmes that align with 
Malaysia’s transition to a clean energy future, driving tangible 
progress in our sustainability initiatives. This commitment has 
not only guided our ongoing efforts but has also earned us 
recognition for excellence in sustainability.

Our Approach to Sustainability
Our Sustainability Commitment
We remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainability by regularly evaluating our initiatives against frameworks such as the UN 
SDGs, to ensure alignment with stakeholders’ expectations while addressing organisational risks. 
To further shape our approach, for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 (FY2024), we conducted a double materiality 
assessment, aligned with the guidelines within the parameters of Bursa Malaysia’s requirement and other ESG reporting frameworks, 
including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN SDGs, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This evaluation considered the significance of sustainability issues from 
two perspectives: financial materiality and impact materiality. Financial materiality focuses on how sustainability issues affect our 
financial performance and position while impact materiality looks at how significant Malakoff affects the environment and society in 
terms of our operations, processes and value chains, to name a few. 
This assessment allowed us to identify and evaluate sustainability issues that are significant to both our financial performance and 
our broader environmental and societal impact. The material matters identified in 2024 are highly relevant to our stakeholders and, 
in turn, shape the development of our sustainability commitments and objectives. 
 For more information on our materiality assessment, refer to pages 54 to 65.

to the IFRS S1 and S2 disclosure requirements for the 2025 financial year end reporting. Our operations and approach will revolve 
around these material matters moving forward. 
While our Sustainability Targets have remained consistent since 2023, we have revised one of our RE targets to better align with the 
positive growth in our RE and environmental solutions businesses, following a decision by our Management Sustainability Committee 
(MSC) in December 2024. We are now targeting to increase profit contribution as opposed to revenue contribution from RE & 
Environmental Solutions to at least 50% in the next ten years for better visibility on earnings monitoring. 
Sustainability Framework
The introduction of Malakoff’s Sustainability Framework as part of the Malakoff Strategic Transformation 2.0 plan emphasises our 
commitment to sustainability. It serves as a key element in our pursuit of long-term environmental and social impact.

Our Approach to Sustainability
Sustainability Governance
The Board of Directors at Malakoff holds the ultimate responsibility for overseeing corporate governance and the creation of value for 
shareholders. This oversight is supported by the Sustainability, Research and Investor Relations (SRIR) Department, which regularly 
reports to both the Management team and Board on the Group’s sustainability and investor relations initiatives.
The MSC is tasked with steering the development of the Group’s strategic direction, chaired by the Managing Director & Group Chief 
Executive Officer. Established based on our 2022 Terms of Reference, the committee is also responsible for ensuring that the Group’s 
strategy is in line with Malakoff’s corporate vision, goals and values. In addition, the MSC plays a critical role in fostering a strong 
sustainability culture within the organisation.
The SRIR is at the forefront of executing sustainability strategies and projects. Serving as the core driver for sustainability efforts, 
the department oversees day-to-day operations and is committed to integrating sustainability principles into tangible initiatives. The 
department also ensures the Group’s actions are in line with ESG objectives, contributing to long-term sustainable success.
To further embed sustainability across Malakoff, we launched roadshows to engage our people; from senior management, Heads of 
Departments to key operational personnel. These sessions are designed to share our sustainability journey, highlighting the crucial 
role each person plays in advancing our corporate objectives. These are ongoing initiatives. We will continue to engage with all levels 
of internal stakeholders to entrench the importance of sustainability within the organisation.
In 2024, the Board actively engaged in various ESG-focused training programmes, seminars and workshops, strengthening their 
grasp of sustainability issues and climate-related risks. These requirements are included in the Annual Board Assessment, facilitated 
by the Company Secretary. It is a critical tool to evaluate the performance of Board members. While the integration of sustainability-
related indicators into the Board’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is still under consideration, we are actively exploring ways to 
embed these elements.
  For further details on the roles of the MSC as well as sustainability responsibilities and governance structure, please refer to the Corporate Governance Overview  
Statement on pages 228 to 249.

OVERVIEW OF MALAKOFF

---- Page 30 ----
T
he global economy navigated a complex and 
evolving landscape, shaped by geopolitical tensions 
and disruptions in international trade. Despite these 
challenges, Malaysia’s economy demonstrated resilience, 
expanding by 5.1% (2023:3.6%), supported by robust domestic 
demand and a rebound in exports. Growth was supported by 
stronger household spending, reflecting favourable labour 
market conditions, policy measures and stable household 
balance sheets. Investment growth was strengthened by strong 
investment approvals and the progress of multi-year projects, 
including catalytic initiatives under national master plans such 
as the New Industrial Master Plan, National Energy Transition 
Roadmap (NETR) and National Semiconductor Strategy. 
However, external headwinds and volatile commodity prices 
posed challenges. 
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to report on Malakoff’s recovery 
in 2024, following a challenging 2023 on 
account of the fluctuating coal prices and 
a substantial share of loss from our 40% 
foreign associate in Bahrain, including an 
impairment loss on the Group’s carrying 
value of investment of the same project in 
Bahrain. The Group regained momentum 
and returned to profitability for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2024 
(FY2024), demonstrating our resilience 
and determination to create value for our 
shareholders.

Chairman’s Message
Amid these conditions, Malakoff delivered 
a robust performance, recording revenue 
of RM8,969.6 million, a marginal 1% decline 
from the previous year, primarily due to 
lower energy payment contributions from 
Tanjung Bin Power Sdn. Bhd. following a 
decline in the coal price. Our Profit After 
Tax and Minority Interests surged over 
100% to RM268.7 million, marking a 
sharp turnaround from the previous year’s 
Loss After Tax and Minority Interests of 
RM837.2 million. This strong recovery was 
driven by improved contributions from our 
plants, stabilising global coal prices and 
the absence of share of loss from a foreign 
associate, Al-Hidd Independent Water 
and Power Plant in Bahrain and lower 
impairment loss on the Group’s carrying 
value of its investment in Al-Hidd.
In line with our commitment to enhancing 
shareholder value, the Board approved an 
interim dividend of 2.23 sen per ordinary 
share, amounting to RM108.9 million for 
FY2024. This was paid in October 2024. 
Additionally, a final dividend of 2.17 sen 
per ordinary share, totalling RM106.0 
million, was approved for FY2024. This is 
expected to be paid in May 2025.
Driving Malaysia’s Clean Energy 
Transition
Malaysia’s transition to clean energy 
continues to gain momentum, fuelled by 
rising demand for sustainable solutions, 
evolving regulations and changing market 
dynamics. Through Malakoff Strategic 
Transformation 2.0, we have reinforced 
our position in renewable energy (RE) and 
environmental solutions while ensuring a 
resilient energy portfolio. Our expanded 
investments in these areas have not only 
accelerated our climate objectives but 
also positioned us at the forefront of the 
region’s energy transition.
The announcement allowing Independent 
Power Producers (IPPs) to sell electricity 
directly to consumers under the ‘wheeling 
charges’ model by Tenaga Nasional Berhad 
(TNB) has introduced new market dynamics, 
unlocking new opportunities for greater 
competition and diversification. In response, 
we capitalised on these developments by 
improving asset efficiency and expanding 
our energy solutions which strengthened our 
presence in Malaysia’s evolving energy sector.
On the operational front, we grew our RE 
capacity to 173 MW through acquisitions 
and project expansions, including the 
purchase of ZEC Solar Sdn. Bhd. and TJZ 
Suria Sdn. Bhd. and the construction of 
the 83 MW small hydropower project in 
Kelantan. Meanwhile, Alam Flora Sdn. 
Bhd. (Alam Flora) increased its recyclable 
material collection by 15% in 2024 as 
compared to 2023, while securing new 
contracts to strengthen sustainable waste 
solutions and circular economy. 
To further strengthen energy security, we 
secured a one-year extension for the 350 
MW Prai Power Plant through a new Power 
Purchase Agreement (PPA) with TNB, with 
an option to extend. The biomass co-firing 
initiative at Tanjung Bin Power Plant, a key 
milestone under the NETR, successfully 
completed installation, testing and 
commissioning. Launched by the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Energy 
Transition and Water Transformation, 
Datuk Sri Fadillah Yusof, the project aims to 
achieve a 15% co-firing ratio by 2027. That 
said, realising this ambition will require 
close collaboration between the public 
and private sectors, with policymakers, 
industry players and stakeholders playing 
a critical role in driving its success. This 
aligns with our commitment to reducing 
GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2031 
and achieving Net Zero by 2050.
Strategic partnerships played a significant 
role in strengthening our technical expertise 
and expanding our capabilities in advanced 
power generation and environmental 
solutions. Our collaborations with Korea 
South-East Power Company and China 
Northeast Electric Power Engineering & 
Services Co. Ltd. have optimised operational 
efficiencies while facilitating the deployment 
of technical personnel to international 
projects. In environmental solutions, our 
partnerships with City Oil Field Inc. and 
Blue Planet Environmental Solutions have 
explored advanced waste treatment 
technologies and landfill rehabilitation, 
driving innovation and sustainable resource 
management.

Chairman’s Message
Strengthening Sustainability  
Sustainability continues to be central to 
Malakoff Strategic Transformation 2.0, 
shaping our long-term growth, resilience 
and market leadership. We have embedded 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) principles into every aspect of our 
business to accelerate the transition to clean 
energy, enhance circular economy practices 
and drive responsible business practices.
Reaffirming this commitment 
to sustainability, we became 
Malaysia’s first IPP to join the 
United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC), aligning our strategies 
with global sustainability 
standards.
A key pillar of this transformation is 
decarbonisation as we work towards 
reducing GHG emissions intensity and 
achieving Net Zero by 2050. To support 
this goal, we have implemented a range 
of green solutions including commercial 
and industrial (C&I) solar, large-scale solar, 
small hydropower developments, biomass 
projects as well as the expansion of carbon-
free mobility infrastructure and battery 
energy storage systems. At the same time, 
we continue to explore new ventures that 
advance our Net Zero journey, reaffirming 
our long-term climate commitments.
In line with our broader sustainability agenda, 
we have advanced our waste management 
solutions, strengthening Malakoff’s role 
in the circular economy. For Alam Flora, 
we continue to scale operations towards 
handling 10,000 tonnes of waste daily by 
2031, enhancing resource recovery efforts 
and driving sustainable waste solutions. 
Given our focus on expanding our business 
pillars, we established 45 dedicated 
Health, Safety, Security & Environment 
Implementation Units to strengthen systems 
oversight, compliance, communication and 
operational security. 
Nevertheless, we did not forget our 
commitment to our communities. In 
2024, we invested RM407,413 in targeted 
community initiatives, benefitting 5,993 
individuals through outreach programmes 
and sustainable development projects, 
reaffirming our commitment to social 
responsibility.
Our efforts in driving RE expansion and 
impactful sustainability initiatives did not 
go unnoticed. At Enlit Asia 2024, we were 
awarded the ‘Independent Power Producer 
of the Year’ for the second consecutive 
year, this time for our pioneering the 
Biomass Co-firing project. We were also 
recognised for the same project at the 
UNGC Network Malaysia & Brunei Forward 
Faster Sustainability Awards 2024.
Further reflecting our commitment to 
responsible business practices, we were 
named ‘Company of the Year’ at the 
Sustainability & CSR Malaysia Awards 
2024. In the waste management sector, we 
received the Waste Management Association 
of Malaysia ‘Excellent Waste Management 
Recognition and Waste Reduction and 
Circularity Award’, acknowledging our 
efforts in advancing circular economy 
practices. 
Notably, Alam Flora was awarded the 
2024 Special Achievement in GIS Award 
in San Diego, California, recognising its 
M Flora Telematics Systems project, a 
breakthrough in waste collection efficiency 
that improved operational effectiveness by 
96% while optimising routes to reduce fuel 
consumption and emissions.
Achieving Net Zero requires collaboration 
across industries to develop the most effective 
solutions. Throughout the year, we leveraged 
new learnings and strategic insights to refine 
decision-making, driving our efforts towards 
a resource-efficient future.
Improving Governance 
At Malakoff, corporate governance is 
integral to driving business performance 
while upholding sustainability commitments. 
The evolving macroeconomic landscape and 
increasing global market interdependencies 
have reinforced the necessity of strong 
ethics, transparency and accountability 
in executing strategies. We focused on 
ensuring robust governance frameworks 
were in place to maintain operational 
resilience, sustain value creation and deliver 
consistent shareholder returns. 
Throughout the year, we continued to 
enhance governance standards, aligning 
practices with international benchmarks to 
strengthen integrity and long-term business 
sustainability. The Board remained actively 
engaged in strategic planning, contributing 
to the Group’s five-year business plan 
(2025 to 2029) and setting the corporate 
Key Performance Indicators for 2025. To 
enhance governance oversight, the Board 
Audit Committee now reviews Conflicts 
of Interest (COI) cases involving Directors 
and key senior management. A COI policy 
has also been adopted to ensure effective 
management of such matters.
As part of ongoing improvements, we 
heightened oversight of emerging risks, 
particularly ESG and cybersecurity threats, 
in response to concerns outlined in the 
Global Risks Report 2024. The MSC, Board 
Risk and Investment Committee and the 
Board provided structured oversight to 
ensure proactive risk mitigation strategies 
were implemented. To further strengthen 
transparency and risk management, we 
introduced the Corruption Risk Register 
Online Database via the TRICOR System 
which serves as a centralised platform to 
streamline corruption risk assessments, risk 
identification and mitigation. 
We are proud to report that our sustainability 
efforts have yielded positive results. While 
Malakoff was not included in the FTSE4Good 
Bursa Malaysia Index due to ineligibility 
under the FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS Index 
(FBM EMAS Index) criteria, we are pleased 
to announce that on 5 December 2024,

long-term value creation.
Outlook  
Malaysia’s economy is set to expand in 
2025, driven by robust investment activity, 
resilient household spending and steady 
export performance. Multi-year projects 
across the private and public sectors, 
including the realisation of approved 
investments, will further accelerate growth, 
supported by government measures such 
as the upward revision of minimum wage 
and civil servant salaries. Easing global 
costs and stable demand are anticipated 
to moderate inflationary pressures. At the 
same time, policy measures are expected 
to shape economic conditions, with 
inflation anticipated to remain manageable, 
ensuring a stable environment for sustained 
expansion amid global uncertainties.
Against this backdrop, we will continue 
to focus on executing secured projects, 
extending the PPA for key assets and 
expanding our Environmental Solutions 
business, particularly in non-concession 
opportunities. We anticipate positive 
developments across the business driven by 
higher plant availability, improved reliability 
and optimised O&M costs at Tanjung Bin 
Power Sdn. Bhd. and Tanjung Bin Energy 
Sdn. Bhd. 
Concurrently, the waste management 
business continues to expand through tariff 
revisions, new concession agreements and 
emerging non-concession opportunities, 
reinforcing our growing role within the 
Group. As we move forward, the continued 
expansion of the IPP business and 
environmental solutions will provide a strong 
foundation for long-term sustainability and 
value creation. 
As Malakoff approaches its 
50th anniversary in 2025, 
our rebranding journey over 
the past year marks a bold 
step towards sustainability, 
innovation and a future-ready 
business.
This evolution reflects a strategic dedication

Managing Director & Group  
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
How has the global macroeconomic 
environment and the rapidly 
evolving energy landscape shaped 
Malakoff’s strategic direction and 
growth trajectory in 2024?
The year 2024 unfolded against a 
backdrop of economic uncertainties, 
escalating climate challenges and 
heightened geopolitical risks. Ongoing 
conflicts in Russia-Ukraine and the Middle 
East intensified volatility in the energy 
market, demonstrating the fragility of 
global energy security. Meanwhile, rising 
electricity demand driven by economic 
expansion, extreme weather events and 
the proliferation of energy-intensive 
industries such as data centres continued 
to reshape market dynamics. 
Domestically, Malaysia’s energy sector 
faced mounting pressure due to regulatory 
shifts, heightened competition from major 
utility companies and international traders 
and surging demand for reliable power. 
The introduction of the National Policy on 
Climate Change 2.0 in September 2024, 
alongside market liberalisation that allows 
IPPs to sell electricity directly to consumers 
have reshaped industry dynamics. 
At the same time, the rapid expansion of 
energy-intensive industries has placed 
unprecedented strain on the national grid, 
emphasising the need for strategic energy 
planning and infrastructure resilience. 
According to the International Renewable 
Energy Agency, Malaysia’s total energy 
consumption is projected to rise by 2.0% 
annually on average, nearly doubling 
by 2050. This projection suggests a 
significant increase in electricity demand 
over the coming decades.  
Globally, the coal market demonstrated 
greater price stability, with benchmark 
indices maintaining a narrower trading 
range, signalling a more balanced market. 
This steadier pricing environment has led 
to more predictable procurement costs, 
alleviating the volatility seen in prior years. 
Additionally, elevated offtake volumes 
contributed to a favourable financial 
impact, enhancing margin stability and 
strengthening revenue visibility.
In navigating this evolving landscape, 
Malakoff reinforced operational resilience 
while harnessing new opportunities for 
strategic growth. By leveraging technical 
expertise and optimising our core assets, 
we continued to meet the nation’s growing 
energy needs while accelerating our RE 
portfolio expansion. We delivered solid 
operational performance, exporting 35,040 
GWh of electricity to the National Grid, an 
increase from 6,825 GWh in 2023, driven 
by improved grid stability and enhanced 
plant efficiencies.
We have also expanded our renewables 
footprint, scaling up investments in solar, 
small hydro and waste-to-energy (WTE) 
projects to solidify our position in the 
clean energy sector. In 2024, we managed 
1.24 million tonnes of waste through 
optimised operations and strategic waste 
management initiatives. This includes 
adjustments following the expiry of 
the transfer station and incinerator in 
Cameron Highlands. Concurrently, through 
our strategic collaboration with Alam 
Flora Environmental Solutions (AFES), 
we are expanding our involvement in the 
WTE sector, reinforcing our commitment 
to sustainable energy solutions and 
advancing circular economy initiatives. 
Meanwhile, Malakoff’s water desalination 
projects in the Middle East remained fully 
operational, consistently meeting regional 
demands and reaffirming Malakoff’s 
expertise in delivering large-scale 
infrastructure solutions.
Looking ahead, we continue to broaden our 
RE and environmental solutions portfolio 
through strategic partnerships and circular 
economy initiatives. As a trusted partner in 
Malaysia’s green transition, we are focused 
on strengthening capabilities, enhancing 
efficiencies and delivering long-term value 
in an evolving energy landscape.
Dear Shareholders, 
2024 was a year of progress and 
momentum as we strengthened 
Malakoff’s resilience, expanded 
our renewable energy (RE) 
footprint and moved forward 
with sustainable solutions. 
With a clear focus on innovation and 
operational excellence, we navigated 
industry shifts, reinforced energy security 
and delivered long-term value. As we move 
ahead, we remain committed to driving 
Malaysia’s green transition and contributing 
to a resilient energy future.

Managing Director & Group 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Aligned with our long-term sustainability 
commitments, we have set clear goals 
focused on reducing carbon emissions, 
expanding RE capacity and improving waste 
management handling. To name a few, we 
are targeting an RE capacity of 1,400 MW 
by 2031 and aiming to achieve a 15% to 
20% recycling rate by 2025 from the waste 
collected by Alam Flora. On that note, we are 
pleased to share that in 2024, we achieved 
a recycling rate of 21.1%, surpassing the 
higher-end of the target by 1.1%. We remain 
focused on driving initiatives that create 
a lasting impact and foster an energy 
ecosystem that is efficient, resilient and 
anchored in long-term value creation.
As we approach our 50 th  anniversary, I 
believe that this milestone is not just a 
reflection of our legacy, but a catalyst 
for our future. Our transformation is 
embedded in Malakoff’s new corporate 
identity, symbolising our evolution 
beyond conventional power generation 
into a diversified, sustainability-driven 
entity. It signifies a company that is 
not merely adapting to change but 
shaping it, continuously innovating to 
redefine possibilities in the energy and 
environmental sectors.
How is Malakoff leveraging 
the momentum of its Malakoff 
Strategic Transformation 2.0 to 
capitalise on the opportunities presented 
by its 50th Anniversary in 2025, including 
the recent brand revitalisation? 
The energy sector is undergoing a 
profound transformation, driven by the 
dual challenge of securing reliable power 
while accelerating decarbonisation. As 
Malaysia’s largest IPP, contributing 25% of 
Peninsular Malaysia’s generation capacity 
as at the end of 2024, we recognise our 
responsibility to deliver energy solutions 
that balance sustainability, resilience and 
long-term economic growth.
In 2021, we embarked on a transformative 
journey, making a concerted effort to 
position Malakoff as a fully integrated, 
sustainability-driven powerhouse in the 
energy sector. The Malakoff Strategic 
Transformation 2.0 plan was introduced in 
response to the gradual phase-out of coal-
fired power plants and the accelerating 
shift to renewables. To strengthen our 
direction, we rebranded the organisation 
under the three core business pillars 
— Malakoff Green Solutions, Malakoff 
Environmental Solutions and Malakoff 
Energy — reinforcing our commitment to 
harnessing renewables, advancing circular 
economy advancement and driving energy 
security. This approach ensures that we 
adapt to industry shifts and actively lead 
Malaysia’s energy transition.
Building on our rebranding initiatives in 
2023, we commemorated our progress 
over the year with an event that introduced 
Alam Flora’s and AFES’ new uniforms while 
infusing new momentum into our long-
term vision for sustainable growth and 
energy security. This transition reaffirmed 
Malakoff’s commitment to a greener 
future while nurturing our integration 
with Alam Flora, creating a unified force 
in energy and environmental solutions. By 
aligning our strategy, we ensure that all 
our stakeholders view Malakoff and Alam 
Flora as a single, cohesive entity that 
drives innovation, operational excellence 
and environmental stewardship. Across 
all subsidiaries, we remain committed to 
advancing ESG principles and contributing 
to the UN SDGs, all aligned with our 
overarching purpose of “Enhancing Life, 
Enriching Communities”. 
This commitment was mirrored in the 
execution of our sustainability-driven 
roadmap. RE expansion remained a key 
priority, driven by strategic acquisitions 
and partnerships. Our solar and hydro 
projects continued to gain momentum, 
reflecting a structured approach to 
harnessing green energy solutions. 
The successful launch of our Biomass 
Co-firing project at Tanjung Bin Power 
Plant marked a key milestone in our 
decarbonisation strategy, reinforcing 
Malaysia’s Net Zero ambitions while 
ensuring grid security. Alam Flora 
continued to drive waste recovery and 
circular economy advancements while 
WTE solutions enhanced resource 
efficiency by converting waste to RE, 
further strengthening Malakoff’s role 
as a key driver of sustainable waste

Managing Director & Group 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
How has Malakoff advanced its 
business pillars in 2024, and 
what pivotal achievements highlight 
the Group’s progress?
Ensuring a stable, sustainable power supply 
is critical especially as electricity demand 
surges, particularly from energy-intensive 
sectors. To address this, we implemented 
a disciplined strategy to enhance energy 
security while accelerating the shift to 
renewables.
A key milestone in 2024 was securing the 
Prai Power Plant extension in Penang, 
reinforcing our role in grid stability. The 
renewed PPA for this 350 MW Combined-
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) facility with 
Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) ensures 
continued energy supply from 6 September 
2024 to 5 September 2025, with the 
option for further extensions. This renewal 
is expected to contribute to Malakoff’s 
financial performance in the upcoming year. 
To drive decarbonisation, we launched 
the Biomass Co-firing Project at Tanjung 
Bin Power Plant in Johor, achieving a 2% 
co-firing ratio, with plans to scale it to 
15% by 2027. This initiative is expected to 
cut carbon emissions significantly, which 
is equivalent to planting over 141 million 
mature trees while supporting Malaysia’s 
Just Energy Transition agenda. Throughout 
the year, we continued to explore innovative 
technologies, including smart silo systems 
and torrified pellets, to optimise biomass 
integration and transition towards cleaner 
energy solutions. 
In parallel, we are actively securing several 
new CCGT plants with sizable capacities 
on land owned by Malakoff or within the 
Group across Peninsular Malaysia as these 
assets will be critical in supporting grid 
stability and accommodating growing 
energy demand. 
We continued to break new ground on 
the international front by strengthening 
our global presence through strategic 
partnerships. In Bangladesh, our 
collaboration with China Northeast Electric 
Power Engineering & Services Co. Ltd. 
expanded our role in advanced H-class 
technology and maintenance to manage 
two 1,167 MW of Combined-Cycle Power 
Plants (CCPPs). Meanwhile, our alliance 
with Korea South-East Power Company 
enhanced our expertise in power plant 
operations, biomass fuel planning and 
RE integration, reinforcing Malakoff’s 
technical leadership in the international 
energy market. 
On the renewables front, we advanced 
our RE portfolio, increasing our capacity 
to 173 MW through strategic acquisitions 
and new project developments. The 
completion of the ZEC Solar Sdn. Bhd. 
and TJZ Suria Sdn. Bhd. acquisitions 
towards the end of January expands our 
solar portfolio by 14.79 MW. ZEC Solar 
Sdn. Bhd. currently owns a 29 MW solar 
facility in Kota Tinggi, Johor, operating 
under a 21-year Solar PPA with TNB 
until 2040. These acquisitions will not 
only pave the way for Malakoff’s RE 
expansion, but also position the Group 
as a strong contender in upcoming Large 
Scale Solar (LSS) bidding exercises, both 
locally and internationally.
In 2024, Malakoff Radiance Sdn. Bhd.  
(MRSB) secured 22.1 MWp of commercial 
and industrial (C&I) solar projects, with 
17.4 MWp installed. Notable clients include 
Senai International Airport, Malaysia Flying 
Academy, UMW Group of Companies, 
Projek Lintasan Kota Holdings Sdn. Bhd., 
Gas Malaysia Berhad (Gas Malaysia), Pos 
Malaysia Berhad and DRB HICOM Berhad. 
In total, MRSB has secured a C&I solar 
portfolio amounting to 60 MWp.
MRSB also spearheaded community-
driven RE initiatives. The 202.96 kWp 
Building-Integrated Photovoltaic Carport 
Solar system at Masjid Saidina Umar Al-
Khattab (MSUA) in Bukit Damansara, Kuala 
Lumpur is Malakoff’s first community-
based solar project. Developed under a 
zero capital expenditure scheme, this 
initiative creates significant electricity cost 
savings for MSUA and sets a precedent for 
future community-solar projects.  
As hydropower remains integral to our 
renewable strategy, we made steady 
progress in constructing the three run-of-
the-river small hydropower plants (SHPs) in 
Kuala Krai, Kelantan. Once operational, the 
Sungai Galas hydro project will generate 
an annual net energy output capable of 
offsetting 272,424 tonnes of CO₂ emissions.

have led to a rise in waste generation, 
intensifying the need for efficient waste 
management. The volume of recyclable 
materials processed by Alam Flora 
increased by 15% from 6,109 tonnes in 
2023 to 7,027 tonnes in 2024, mainly 
due to higher intake at AFES’ Recovery 
Initiative Sustainable Eco-Facility Kuala 
Lumpur (RISE@KL) in Gombak. We 
also secured five-year operation and 
maintenance (O&M) contracts for leachate 
treatment plants in Jabor, Kuantan and 
Ladang CEP, Johor, further enhancing our 
waste recovery capabilities.  
During the year, AFES collaborated with 
City Oil Field Inc. via a Technology Partner 
Agreement to explore eco-friendly plastic 
waste treatment using Pyrolysis Technology 
from Korea. This collaboration will assess 
the feasibility of developing a Regenerated 
Green Oil facility in Malaysia, marking a 
step towards sustainable waste-to-fuel 
solutions. AFES also partnered with Blue 
Planet Environmental Solutions to expand 
landfill rehabilitation and waste treatment.  
We are also pleased to share the 
successful completion of the acquisition 
of a 49% equity interest in E-Idaman 
Sdn. Bhd. (E-Idaman) with Metacorp 
Berhad on 28 February 2025. This move 
enhances our position in the northern 
region’s non-concession segment, 
leveraging E-Idaman’s established market 
presence. The acquisition marks a key 
milestone in Malakoff’s transformation 
journey, reinforcing our commitment 
to sustainability and ESG principles 
and further strengthening our strategic 
presence in the waste management and 
environmental services sector.

Managing Director & Group 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
The relentless focus on digitalisation 
and industrialisation has driven a surge 
in energy needs and data centres are 
emerging as a key driver of electricity 
demand. By 2035, energy consumption 
from data centres is projected to surpass 
5,000 MW, with new supply applications 
exceeding 11,000 MW. This represents 
over 40% of Peninsular Malaysia’s 
total installed capacity, reinforcing the 
imperative to capitalise on renewables 
while maintaining grid resilience. 
To address this, securing PPA extensions 
for critical assets such as the 350 MW 
Prai Power Plant has been essential 
for maintaining baseload generation. 
Notwithstanding these pressures, 
managing the expiry of key PPAs presents 
another challenge, requiring a concerted 
effort to optimise assets. These include 
our 1,303 MW Segari Energy Ventures 
gas plant which will expire in 2027, our 
2,200 MW Kapar Energy Ventures plant 
in 2029, our 2,100 MW Tanjung Bin 
Power plant in 2031 and our 1,000 MW 
Tanjung Bin Energy plant in 2041. We are 
also actively pursuing new CCGT plants 
to navigate these transitions effectively, 
leveraging our operational expertise, site 
readiness and financial strength to support 
Malaysia’s evolving energy agenda and 
the nation’s power demand. 
While renewables are central to energy 
transition, solar’s intermittency requires 
a broader investment in robust storage 
solutions, for example Battery Energy 
Storage System and grid enhancements, 
to support the increasing integration of RE 
as well as ensure system stability. Biomass 
Co-firing, another key transitional energy 
source, faces supply chain constraints, 
compounded by global demand for oil 
palm Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB) which are 
increasingly exported to Japan, South Korea 
and the US for paper and pellet production. 
This not only raises cost pressures but also 
limits local availability as most of the supply 
is primed for export. 
Recognising these challenges, the 
National Biomass Action Plan 2023-2030 
provides a framework to restructure 
this sector. However, concerted efforts 
from policymakers and industry players, 
including clearer regulatory directions, 
well-structured domestic pelletisation 
incentives and the establishment of long-
term supply agreements will be crucial 
for stabilising costs, strengthening local 
supply chains and ensuring a more resilient 
and sustainable industry trajectory.  
WTE projects represent a growing 
but vital component in Malaysia’s 
energy transition as it requires cross-
sector collaboration for effective 
implementation. Given the regulatory, 
technical and financial complexities, a 
clear and unified framework is essential 
to accelerate their development. As 
a result, negotiations are crucial in 
ensuring that all relevant aspects are 
thoroughly examined and carefully 
considered. As WTE adoption expands, 
clear policies and targeted incentives 
will be essential for integrating these 
projects into Malaysia’s energy mix as a 
reliable and sustainable solution, supporting 
its long-term growth. 
The energy transition demands strategic 
foresight, adaptability and strategic 
collaboration. Clear policy direction, strong 
partnerships and investments in resilient 
energy solutions will be critical in ensuring a 
balanced, secure and sustainable transition.

Managing Director & Group 
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
Our Sustainability Framework, introduced 
in 2022 as part of the Malakoff Strategic 
Transformation 2.0 is premised on the 
ESG pillars and the UN SDG framework to 
transition to a cleaner and lower-carbon 
energy mix organisation. We are committed 
to reducing GHG emissions intensity by 
30% from our 2019 baseline by 2031 and 
achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050, 
in line with the Malaysian Government’s 
aspiration under the Twelfth Malaysia Plan 
(2021–2025) and National Energy Policy 
(2022–2040). With the NETR paving 
the way for this transformation journey, 
Malaysia has pledged to cut carbon 
intensity by 45% by 2030, achieve 70% RE 
capacity by 2050 and increase the national 
recycling rate to 40% by 2025. To this 
effect, Malakoff remains at the forefront 
of this transition, integrating sustainability 
across all business pillars to create long-
term value for all its stakeholders while 
safeguarding the environment. 
As part of our commitment to accelerating 
the transition to a cleaner, low-carbon 
energy mix, we continue to expand our 
RE portfolio. This year, we expanded our 
C&I solar portfolio, securing 22.1 MWp 
and installing 17.4 MWp across sites 
such as Senai Airport, Gas Malaysia, Pos 
Malaysia, UMW, Prolintas and the DRB-
HICOM Group. We also introduced a 203 
kWp BIPV carport solar system at MSUA, 
demonstrating an innovative approach 
to building a sustainable community. In 
addition, we expanded our solar capacity 
by 14.79 MW through the acquisition of 
ZEC Solar Sdn. Bhd. and TJZ Suria Sdn. 
Bhd. Our continued investment in solar 
has led to a milestone achievement—
increasing our C&I solar capacity to 60 
MWp by the end of 2024, reinforcing our 
role in Malaysia’s energy transition. 
We are also driving sustainable waste 
management and currently have ten buy 
back centres; three in Putrajaya, five in 
Kuala Lumpur and two in Kuantan. These 
include Recovery Initiative Sustainable 
Eco-Facility Kuala Lumpur and Fasiliti 
Inovasi Kitar Semula (FIKS) in Putrajaya, 
both of which are also our material 
recovery facilities. We have successfully 
collected and managed 3,397 tonnes 
of waste per day, with the potential to 
manage a higher waste volume with our 
current contracts and infrastructure. Now 
that we have completed the acquisition of 
E-Idaman, we have increased our potential 
waste management volume capacity close 
to 5,200 tonnes per day. Our target is to 
handle 10,000 tonnes per day by 2031. 
RISE@KL alone processes 50 tonnes of 
waste daily. This initiative has gained strong 
traction, contributing to circular economy 
efforts and reducing environmental impact 
and reinforcing our dedication to a cleaner, 
more resilient future.
However, sustainability is more than 
just reducing emissions. A truly circular 
economy demands effective and efficient 
resource management, coupled with 
a fundamental shift in consumption 
habits. Through our buy back centres, 
especially RISE@KL and FIKS, we continue 
to champion the principles of reduce, 
reuse and recycle, ensuring that waste 
is diverted from landfills and repurposed 
effectively.
As we move to a cleaner and lower-
carbon energy mix while supporting the 
nation’s power demand, balancing the 
energy trilemma of security, affordability 
and sustainability is vital in the journey 
towards sustainable development. At 
Malakoff, we will continue to expand

entering new energy markets in this region 
presents challenges, with intensifying 
competition in tariffs and fluctuations 
in conventional and solar project prices 
reshaping the region’s energy landscape. 
Malaysia’s regulatory landscape is also 
evolving, with the planned introduction of 
a carbon tax in 2026, targeting the energy, 
iron and steel industries. Announced by the 
Prime Minister and Finance Minister, Datuk 
Seri Anwar Ibrahim in Malaysia’s Budget 
2025 on 18 October 2024, this initiative 
aims to encourage the adoption of low-
carbon technologies and support the 
country’s decarbonisation goals. Revenue 
generated from the tax will be channelled 
into green technology programmes and 
research.
However, the mechanism and formula have 
yet to be disclosed, making it challenging 
for us to assess its financial impact. It may 
be necessary for us to start factoring in 
potential carbon tax implications from 
2026, thereby reinforcing the urgency to 
invest strategically in renewables, cleaner 
energy sources and emissions reduction 
initiatives to mitigate future cost pressures 
and regulatory risks. With these shifts 
on the horizon, accelerating Malaysia’s 
energy transition is no longer an option 
but an imperative. 
With only a few years remaining to achieve 
Malaysia’s 2031 sustainability targets, 
decisive action is crucial. Balancing 
climate imperatives, energy security risks 
and mounting stakeholder expectations 
demands an accelerated transition to 
a low-carbon economy. Against this 
backdrop, Malakoff is positioning itself 
at the forefront of Malaysia’s energy 
transformation. We view these challenges 
as opportunities to leverage our expertise, 
operational strength and financial 
resilience, turning these headwinds into 
catalysts for sustainable growth.

IMPACT 
As Malakoff continues to expand and adapt to the evolving energy landscape, human capital management remains a critical 
priority to support its growth and operational efficiency. Attracting and retaining top talent are essential for maintaining a 
competitive edge in the industry.
While significant investments have been made in recruitment and training programmes, sustaining a highly skilled workforce 
requires more than just hiring and development. The potential loss of experienced employees poses challenges to business 
continuity, institutional knowledge retention and overall workforce stability.
OUR RESPONSE 
A positive workplace culture is key to employee satisfaction, motivation and retention. Malakoff strengthens engagement 
through initiatives such as Family Day, employee recognition programmes and wellness activities that foster belonging and 
drive motivation. Open communication channels, including feedback sessions and leadership dialogues, ensure transparency 
and inclusivity, while sports and corporate social responsibility programmes promote teamwork and collaboration.
To enhance talent retention, Malakoff has established a proactive employee relations framework to address workplace 
concerns, resolve conflicts and uphold fairness. Structured grievance mechanisms and regular employee surveys provide 
valuable insights, enabling targeted interventions to improve workplace satisfaction.
Workforce planning and succession strategies ensure business continuity by developing a strong talent pipeline. Collaborations 
with industry partners and educational institutions create career pathways and internship programmes, while enhanced 
employer branding attracts top talent and reinforces Malakoff’s reputation as an employer of choice.

Operating Landscape
OUTLOOK 
Malakoff remains committed to building a skilled, diverse and resilient workforce that drives operational excellence and long-term 
sustainability. The integration of Employee Relations functions within our broader workforce strategy ensures that engagement, 
retention and workplace satisfaction continue to improve.
Strengthening partnerships with educational institutions and industry players will create a continuous talent pipeline while ongoing 
leadership training and technical certifications will equip employees with future-ready skills. Through these efforts, Malakoff will 
remain agile, competitive and well-prepared to navigate future challenges and opportunities in the industry.
Continuous learning and development are essential to sustaining a skilled workforce. Malakoff expands training programmes 
to upskill employees, offering leadership development, technical certifications and mentorship programmes that promote 
career growth and professional excellence.
Employee well-being remains a priority, with flexible work arrangements, wellness programmes and Employee Assistance 
Programmes fostering resilience and work-life balance. Mental health initiatives, along with welfare programmes such as 
hospitalisation support and staff donations, reinforce a compassionate and supportive work environment.
REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE LANDSCAPE
IMPACT 
Malaysia’s regulatory landscape is shifting towards sustainability, with the NETR driving the transition to RE and emissions 
reduction in line with global targets. The plan sets clear goals to expand renewables, enhance energy efficiency and lower 
carbon intensity, ensuring long-term energy security and affordability. Businesses in energy, manufacturing and industry must 
adapt by adopting cleaner technologies, optimising energy use and participate in carbon reduction initiatives. 
The establishment of the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation and the proposed carbon tax reflect a firm 
policy direction. Meanwhile, Bursa Malaysia’s voluntary carbon market provides businesses with a platform to offset emissions 
and support national carbon neutrality efforts.
OUR RESPONSE 
We reinforced our commitment to sustainability by securing financing linked to Environmental, Social and Governance 
principles and evaluating green bond opportunities for future projects. At the same time, we steadily shifted towards 
environmentally driven revenue streams, reducing reliance on coal-generated income.
To advance our environmental goals, we conducted feasibility studies and launched pilot projects to cut net emissions from 
coal plants while expanding our green solutions portfolio. Collaborating with off-takers and industry experts, we also worked 
on circular economy initiatives, driving a more holistic and future-focused approach to sustainability.
OUTLOOK 
Malakoff remains committed to aligning with national sustainability goals, ensuring long-term resilience and growth. As the 
landscape evolves, we will adapt to regulatory shifts while maintaining our competitive edge. By reducing environmental impact 
and maximising resource efficiency, we aim to drive Malaysia’s transition to a sustainable future.

DIGITALISATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
IMPACT 
Global and local advancements in digitalisation and technology are reshaping industries, driving innovation, improving operational 
efficiency and enhancing customer experiences across various sectors. We have made significant strides in enhancing their 
operations through digital transformation initiatives.
A strong focus on strengthening IT infrastructure and reinforcing cybersecurity awareness has resulted in improved security 
measures and heightened compliance standards. This is evidenced by the successful recertification of the upgraded ISO/IEC 
27001:2022 certification, which underscores the robustness of our security protocols.
Concurrently, the implementation of advanced tools has significantly improved customer experience and operational efficiency. 
These enhancements have provided deeper insights and streamlined user experiences. 
The digitalisation efforts have modernised operations, elevated productivity and improved operational efficiency.
OUR RESPONSE 
Significant strides have been made in digital transformation, enhancing data management and user engagement. Meanwhile, 
efforts to modernise IT infrastructure, included upgrading servers, firewalls and network access controls and conducting 
extensive cybersecurity awareness programmes. These measures have strengthened security and enhanced the overall 
efficiency of digital operations. 
Positive strides have also been made in automating processes and adopting analytics, demonstrating our ongoing journey 
towards digitalising the workplace. 
At the same time, work continues on transforming the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, with the aim of making it 
more fit-for-purpose, cost-effective, able to run simplified processes and support future business growth. This transformation 
spans critical areas such as finance, billing, procurement, human resources and plant and fleet maintenance, ensuring long-
term operational success.
OUTLOOK 
We are focused on transforming our ERP system and investing in Artificial Intelligence capabilities to enhance efficiency and 
drive the next phase of growth. Additionally, we have initiated a series of strategic initiatives to strengthen our digital ecosystem, 
focusing on deeper integration, collaborative business applications, building a comprehensive data retention strategy, enhanced 
data analytics capability, scalable infrastructure and reinforce cybersecurity and compliance.

Matters Material to Value Creation
In essence, financial materiality is centred on the extent of the impact arising from a material topic on our financial, business and 
operational performance. This encompasses impacts; potential and actual to the business model, value chain and principal financial 
value creation strategies of the Group. 
The impact materiality perspective is driven by how our financial, business and operational performance, including the business model and 
implemented strategies and practices have profound actual or potential impacts on the environment, society as well as other considerations 
such as the economy, nation-building aspirations and the UN SDGs.
The incorporation of the financial materiality perspective was a key justification for the reassessment of materiality in 2024. This 
approach enables us to not only identify material topics but also to establish related risks and opportunities associated with these 
topics. Subsequently, it guides the development of strategic and financially oriented disclosures in accordance with the National 
Sustainability Reporting Framework and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 in future reporting. 
Malakoff’s decision to conduct a new materiality assessment also aligns with the Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability Reporting Guide, 
which mandates that listed companies perform a comprehensive materiality assessment at least once every three years, or whenever 
there are significant changes to their business model or operating environment.
In 2024, Malakoff embarked on a double materiality assessment exercise (MAE). The previous 
MAE was undertaken in 2021 based on a single perspective, considering the impact of Malakoff’s 
actions to the Group’s financial, environment and society. In the recent MAE, we ascertain our 
material topics based on the following perspectives:
Topics that are 
material from a financial impact 
perspective
Topics that are

perspective

Matters Material to Value Creation
The selection of the topics for inclusion in the MAE was based on Bursa Malaysia’ listing requirements where a listed issuer is required 
to disclose material topics, state how these topics are identified, prioritise the materiality of each topic in terms of its importance, 
and review as well as validate the process and outcome of the assessment. In framing the required material topics, we also referred 
to other global ESG frameworks including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CPD) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), taking into consideration industry-specific 
material issues which are relevant to the Group. We also structured our selection of material topics based on the following criteria:
Our existing business model and our continued journey of transformation towards sustaining and strengthening 
business resilience, competitive edge and ultimately value creation
Consideration of topics that are likely to be more 
material to financial, business and operational 
performance
Topics that have emerged as material or 
potentially material with the implementation of 
new reporting standards
Trends and developments in the external 
operating environment
Considerations for stakeholders’ views, 
perspectives, aspirations, needs and concerns

The topics were categorised according to the ESG pillars:   Environmental     Social     Governance
We developed a customised survey comprising various multiple and open-ended questions based on the topics to elicit responses 
from the participants i.e. our stakeholders. The survey was launched in early December 2024 and closed in mid-January 2025. 
Both external and internal stakeholders provided responses that contributed to our preliminary findings on the extent of materiality for 
each topic. The feedback given by the stakeholders was assigned different weightage based on stakeholders’ ranking as determined 
through the survey. The feedback was further refined and translated into meaningful findings for our deliberation at both the strategic 
working level and the Management Committee Members level, which primarily comprises our C-suites executives and ex officio.  
Our participating internal stakeholders included the Board of Directors, Senior Management, Middle Management and Executive/Non-
Executive Employees. External stakeholders who responded included representatives from regulatory bodies, suppliers, investors/
shareholders, financiers, suppliers, non-governmental organisations and customers. 
The final, approved MAE results indicated some degree of change in the prioritisation of of the material topics, aligned with the 
current industry’s operating environment. Nevertheless, we also observed similarities with our 2021 MAE exercise, particularly in the 
ranking and prioritisation of the first four material topics, which were also considered highly material and ranked within the medium-
highest quadrant in the 2021 MAE (refer to the materiality matrix below).
Note:
Topics represented by the grey circles above were the previous names disclosed in the 2023 Integrated Annual Reporting. Numbers in the grey circles represent the order 
of the material topics in the 2023 reporting. With the above changes, Employee Engagement and Well-Being, Economic Performance and Data Privacy and Security have 
been assimilated into the updated list of material topics.

Matters Material to Value Creation
Good Governance and Corporate Integrity and Regulatory 
Compliance have re-emerged as high-priority material matters 
in line with our commitment to strengthening our fundamentals, 
while driving for profitability and sustainability. 
This reflects both our external and internal stakeholder consensus 
on the need for a well-managed operation with robust processes, 
controls and management approaches at both macro and 
specific levels. We prioritise these areas to enhance operational 
efficiency, sustain our competitive ability and uphold ethical 
conduct, anti-corruption measures and corporate integrity. 
Similarly, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) remains a 
high priority for us, as maintaining strong vigilance is essential 
to prevent disruptions and productivity losses at our sites due to 
safety incidents or regulatory actions. 
Swift response is integral to maintaining our Operational 
Excellence and strategic agility. This is particularly crucial in 
ensuring a measured and successful management approach 
to regulatory changes, as well as the evolving demands of 
customers, financiers and investors.
We have also identified GHG Emissions as well as Physical and 
Transition Climate Risks as being significantly material to us. 
This is consistent with the Group’s comparatively high emissions 
profile, potential level of asset exposure to climate risks and 
exposures to transition risks arising from policy change in the 
medium to long-term. 
In response, we have undertaken various strategic measures 
to decarbonise including the development of a Group wide 
decarbonisation plan. Going forward, we will conduct climate 
risk assessments to determine the severity and likelihood of 
individual asset exposure to physical risks, along with the 
financial implication, if any. 
The Group’s strategy also includes a continued pivot towards 
RE adoption and generation, reinforcing the comparatively high 
positioning of Renewable Energy Transition and Energy Mix 
and Efficiency on the 2024 matrix. 
The plans for renewable energy (RE) will involve financial 
planning, capital expenditure and structured provisions and 
allocations over a defined period. This supports our present 
management approach to incorporating financial considerations 
into asset management and operational efficiency. 
Talent Management and Development remains our key 
priority, especially in balancing technological advancements with 
human expertise. Despite the increased reliance on automation, 
technology and digitalisation, the continued requirement for 
skilled, professional talent remains vital, including for the 
deployment of technology. 
The MAE exercise has also reaffirmed that Human and Labour 
Rights remains highly material to us. Our employees are the 
backbone of our operations, and the energy sector accounts for 
25% of Malaysia’s total workforce.
The topics Waste Management and Effluents, Asset Life Cycle 
and Integrity, Biodiversity, Coal Ash Management, Grid 
Stability, Technology and Innovation, Community Impact, 
Water Management and Supply Chain Management hold 
varying levels of importance for us. While some, such as Waste 
Management and Effluents, Asset Life Cycle and Integrity, 
and Grid Stability, carry a medium to high level of impact and 
financial materiality, others, like Biodiversity and Community 
Impact, have relatively lower financial materiality but remain 
essential to our sustainability efforts.
These topics are integral to our commitment to environmental 
responsibility, operational resilience and ethical business 
practices, ensuring a well-rounded approach to long-term value 
creation.

Our Strategy
Malakoff Strategic Transformation 2.0 continues to drive the Group’s efforts in integrating 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) best practices into our Group. Anchored by our 
purpose of “Enhancing Life, Enriching Communities,” this strategy focuses on diversifying and 
expanding our business portfolio, prioritising ESG materialities and delivering sustainable value. 
Our vision to be a leading global energy generation and environmental solutions player, shaping 
a greener future through innovation and sustainability practices, remains intact. 
In 2024, we made strong progress in advancing our strategic goals, focusing on increasing investments in renewable energy (RE), 
enhancing environmental solutions solidifying our position as an energy solution provider and exploring commercially viable green 
opportunities. Our RE generation capacity stands at 173 MW to date, an increase of 496.6% compared to the 2021 baseline. Our 
waste management volume was 3,397 tonnes per day. With our current existing contracts and infrastructure, we have the potential 
to handle a higher capacity, showcasing our commitment to advance in the space of environmental solutions. Our maximum 
waste management capacity can reach close to 5,200 tonnes per day. This includes the 49% equity interest in E-Idaman Sdn. Bhd. 
(E-Idaman) on 28 February 2025. Our approach remains centred on generating positive sustainable shareholders’ value from existing 
operations and future businesses by building a future-ready, ESG-driven portfolio through strategic and sustainable investments. 
We continue to focus on creating positive value from our thermal power generation with plans to grow our gas portfolio in Malaysia. 
This is in line with our efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensity and to support the nation’s demand for energy security, balancing 
our journey towards sustainability supporting the Government’s sustainability aspirations. Being the largest independent power plant 
in Malaysia, our effective generation capacity in Malaysia currently stands at 5,342 MW. 
In 2025, we will continue to deploy our Malakoff Strategic Transformation 2.0 while adopting a case-by-case approach towards 
international expansion as well as the water desalination business in the short term. We are charting our growth trajectory in 
the short to medium term on the domestic front, capitalising on potential opportunities in Malaysia with a stronger focus on RE, 
environmental solutions and thermal energy generation. The Group continues to strive for operational excellence across the board 
integrating it with other key enablers such as digital enablement and organisational transformation, with sustainability initiatives 
entrenched throughout the organisation.
To recap, Malakoff Strategic Transformation 2.0 comprises five strategic growth areas and is supported by the following four key enablers:

INVESTOR INFORMATION
Malakoff stands firm in our values, which is putting our stakeholders at the centre of our purpose. We remain fully committed 
to disseminating transparent and consistent information with clarity, equal access, accuracy, timeliness and comprehensiveness 
on continuous updates regarding the Malakoff’s operations, financial performance, sustainability initiatives, key development 
progress, strategic direction and future plans. We custom-made our engagement strategic plans to meet key stakeholders’ value 
expectations. Throughout the year, we actively engaged with investment communities and other stakeholders regularly in line with 
the recommendation of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance and other relevant regulatory bodies. This enabled us to better 
understand the stakeholders’ changing needs and allow them to make informed investment decisions, resulting in the forging of 
strong relationships, maintaining the trust of the investment communities in Malakoff. Understanding investors’ needs and wants is 
essential for a successful Investor Relations (IR) initiative. The team ensured that all queries and concerns were addressed as timely 
and comprehensively as possible, whilst providing access for external stakeholders, particularly the investment community, to our 
senior management when required.
In 2024, Malakoff proactively addressed investors’ concerns by actively expanding its renewable energy (RE) portfolio and exploring 
new gas plant opportunities to strengthen growth prospects. Amid persistent fuel margin pressures and coal price volatility, the 
Group closely monitored coal inventories and maintained regular dialogue with key stakeholders to mitigate impacts. To prepare 
for the anticipated 2026 Carbon Tax, Malakoff increased investor engagement and transparency around sustainability initiatives, 
demonstrating clear progress on its ESG roadmap and net-zero milestones. Additionally, Malakoff upheld investors’ confidence by 
maintaining a dividend payout ratio of at least 70% of PATMI, aligning with expectations for high-yield returns.
As an organisation that is committed to sustainability, we are committed to creating and preserving sustained values for all our 
stakeholders through our strategy and sustainability targets. It is also crucial to engage with stakeholders to ensure that they 
understand our objectives, goals and expectations, enabling them to make informed decisions.
The Sustainability, Research and Investor Relations (SRIR) team is an integral part of Malakoff’s corporate governance initiatives. 
Our SRIR team supports the Managing Director and Group Chief Executive Officer as well as the Chief Financial Officer in their 
engagement efforts to cultivate strong relationships with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders. We pride ourselves on 
consistently maintaining direct and open communication with our stakeholders and keeping the market informed of all information 
which may have or could be expected to have a material impact on the value of our securities.

In 2024, the RE landscape saw significant momentum globally and regionally, driven by an escalating focus on sustainability and green 
energy adoption. Governments improved incentives and introduced progressive policies to encourage the shift toward renewables 
while businesses and consumers increasingly prioritised climate-conscious choices. Rising electricity costs bolstered the adoption of 
alternative energy solutions with solar power emerging as a preferred option for its scalability and cost-effectiveness.
The solar segment experienced significant growth, largely driven by increased investments from the commercial and industrial 
including residential sectors seeking to reduce energy costs and carbon footprints. This growth was further supported by the rising 
adoption of Building Integrated Photovoltaic System (BIPV) carport systems, which gained momentum as electric vehicle (EV) 
infrastructure and BESS expanded.
Technological advancements, including higher-efficiency solar panels, solar safety devices and improved energy storage solutions, 
further enhanced the competitiveness in the commercial and industrial solar landscape. Additionally, regulatory frameworks and

Alam Flora operates in a dynamic business environment, facing both external and operational challenges that impact its efficiency, 
sustainability and financial performance. One of the key external challenges is the increasing operational cost without a corresponding 
tariff increase by the government. Rising fuel prices, maintenance expenses and overall operational costs have also placed financial 
pressure on the company, making it difficult to sustain service quality without tariff adjustments. 
Rising operational costs, evolving workforce dynamics and infrastructure constraints continue to challenge efficiency and 
sustainability efforts. At the same time, changing weather patterns and limited public awareness of waste segregation and recycling 
have contributed to higher landfill volumes and increased pollution risks. On the operational front, ageing assets and evolving 
industry regulations have affected service effectiveness, highlighting the need for continuous investment in technology, workforce 
development and innovation. To navigate these complexities, we continue to drive proactive engagement with stakeholders and 
policymakers to build a more resilient and sustainable operational ecosystem.

WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO
Our thermal power generation consists of five thermal power plants in Malaysia with a combined generation capacity of 5,342 
MW. Each facility supplies energy to Tenaga Nasional Berhad under the individual Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Beyond 
Malaysia, our portfolio includes international assets such as the Shuaibah Phase 3 Independent Water and Power Producer 
(IWPP) in Saudi Arabia and the Al-Hidd Independent Water and Power Producer (IWPP) in Bahrain.
As part of our commitment to a cleaner, more sustainable future, we are accelerating efforts to green our thermal plants, 
ensuring a responsible and balanced energy transition. In line with this, we have demonstrated the capability for a co-firing rate 
of up to 2% biomass at our 2,100 MW coal-fired Tanjung Bin Power Plant (TBPP). Our target is to reach a 15% co-firing ratio by 
2027, significantly reducing the nation’s carbon footprint, enhancing grid stability and aligning with Malaysia’s commitment to 
a Just Energy Transition. However, scaling up requires a range of critical factors to ensure the success of this National Energy 
Transition Roadmap (NETR) project. A concerted effort from all stakeholders, including policymakers and industry players, will 
be essential in driving this initiative forward and realising its full potential.

In 2024, higher energy demand drove a year-on-year increase in power generation at our gas plant, demonstrating its essential 
role in meeting Malaysia’s energy requirements. Meanwhile, the global coal market showed signs of stabilisation, with Indonesian 
sub-bituminous coal prices ranging between USD70/mt and USD80/mt, while Newcastle bituminous coal prices settling at USD110-
USD150/mt.
The price stability translated into a more consistent Applicable Coal Price for TBP and TBE, a significant improvement from the 
volatility experienced in 2022 and 2023. Increased offtake, further supported by the unavailability of other major coal plants 
contributed positively to financial performance.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW
In 2024, the Group advanced its 
decarbonisation agenda with the 
successful installation and commissioning 
of a 2% biomass co-firing system at TBPP. 
This milestone reinforces our commitment 
to cost efficiency and risk mitigation, 
ensuring a balanced transition towards 
cleaner energy without compromising 
operational stability. 
As we focus on increasing biomass co-firing 
capacity, efforts are underway to evaluate 
alternative biomass fuels to gradually 
elevate co-firing capability, targeting 
a minimum of 15% co-firing readiness 
by 2027. At the same time, operational 
reliability remains a priority, supported 
by rigorous due diligence and planned 
maintenance outages. To strengthen 
execution, the Group has conducted 
comprehensive training programmes, 
equipping our employees with technical 
knowledge in biomass co-firing while 
enhancing their understanding of process 
risks and safety protocols. These enable 
them to manage operational challenges, 
assess hazards and adopt best practices in 
biomass handling and combustion. 
In line with continuous process 
optimisations, we are also currently 
evaluating cutting-edge technologies and 
experiences from Japan and Europe in 
biomass handling, co-firing combustion 
systems and equipment optimisation to 
support the commercial phase. These 
efforts align with our broader strategy 
to drive efficiency while managing fuel 
variability and cost factors.
The achievement of this biomass co-
firing hinges on securing the necessary 
funding, constant supply of biomass fuel 
and establishing a fuel cost pass-through 
mechanism, ensuring the long-term financial 
sustainability of biomass integration. Our 
ultimate goal is to achieve 15% biomass 
co-firing capability by 2027, reinforcing our 
commitment to reducing emissions while 
maintaining system resilience.
In addition to co-firing initiatives, the 
Group remains focused on optimising 
operational efficiency at TBEPP. Ongoing 
efforts are being made to improve 
the technical heat rate with rigorous 
maintenance practices in place to drive 
higher performance and ensure the 
plant’s long-term reliability.
The Group has also secured an extension 
of the PPA for the Prai Power Plant 
(PPP) following the presentation of 
a comprehensive financial model 
assessment in our tender submission. 
The one-year extension, effective 6 
September 2024, sets the foundation for 
potential further extensions, subject to 
regulatory approval.
By integrating structured training, 
advanced technology and robust process 
enhancements, we are future-proofing 
our assets and positioning the Group 
as a leader in Malaysia’s clean energy 
transformation.

 Physical and Transition Climate Risks  M5
We recognise the significant impacts that climate change can 
have on our operations and we are focused on addressing 
both physical and transition climate risks. By identifying and 
addressing these risks, we can develop strategies that reduce the 
likelihood of disruptions and protect our long-term operations. 
Our Board Risk and Investment Committee (BRIC) oversees 
the Group’s risk oversight responsibilities, followed by the 
Management Risk Committee, which assists BRIC in its functions. 
At the plant operational level, our risks are managed through the 
Plant Risk Committee (refer to Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control, pages 257 to 262 of this Integrated Annual 
Report). The Group will continue to monitor the risks associated 
with this material topic.
 We are dedicated to rapidly expanding our RE initiatives 
to increase our green energy capacity and significantly 
lower our carbon footprint. Additionally, we actively 
engage in strategic partnerships with industry leaders 
and policymakers to accelerate RE adoption while setting 
clear carbon reduction milestones to monitor and track

Decarbonisation Pathway
 Why It Is Important
 Our Approach
Climate change poses significant risks to our operations, assets 
and the communities we serve. Physical risks, such as extreme 
weather events and rising sea levels, can disrupt our infrastructure 
and supply chains. Transition risks, including regulatory changes 
and shifts in market preferences towards low-carbon solutions, 
can impact our business model and financial performance.  
Moreover, Malaysia’s climate risk projections further highlight 
the urgency of this approach. Between 1970 and 2013, the 
country experienced a surface mean temperature increase 
of 0.14°C–0.25°C per decade, with average temperatures 
expected to rise by 3.11°C by the 2090s under high emissions 
scenarios. Additionally, precipitation patterns are anticipated to 
become more intense, particularly in East Malaysia, leading to 
more frequent and severe flooding events. Sea levels are also 
projected to rise between 0.4 and 0.7 metres by the end of the 
century, posing significant threats to coastal infrastructure and 
communities1.
For Malakoff, understanding and mitigating physical and 
transition climate risks is essential to build our resilience against 
future climate impacts, ensuring the company’s long-term 
viability and success. These projections underscore the need 
for comprehensive risk management strategies to mitigate both 
physical and transition climate risks. By integrating climate risk 
assessments into our strategic planning, we aim to build resilience 
against future climate impacts and ensure Malakoff’s long-term 
viability and success.

due to a higher demand for electricity from the national grid. 
This surge in electricity demand required greater fuel usage to 
generate the necessary power, reflecting the expanding energy 
needs of our operations. Despite the increase in fuel consumption, 
we achieved a significant reduction in our emissions intensity, 
lowering it from 0.81 tCO 2e/MWh in FY2023 to 0.78 tCO2e/
MWh in 2024. Additionally, the higher gross energy produced 
highlighted our operational efficiency and effective utilisation 
of available energy sources. We also included biomass in our 
inventory, demonstrating our commitment to scaling up our 
renewable sources and ensuring more efficient and sustainable 
energy production.    
 For more details on our gross energy produced and emissions intensity, 
please refer to the GHG Emissions section on pages 134 to 137.
Total Fuel Consumption (MW)
Our total electricity consumption showed a decreasing trend in 
2024 due to the expiry of the GB3 Power Plant in Perak as well 
as significant improvements in electricity conservation initiatives 
at SEV, PPP, TBPP and TBEP. These conservation efforts are a 
crucial step in reducing our carbon footprint and demonstrating 
our commitment to more sustainable operations. We will continue 
striving to optimise our energy use, implement energy-efficient 
practices and maintain our operational effectiveness, ensuring 
that our environmental impact remains minimal.

Going Forward  
To drive industry progress, we prioritise active collaboration with stakeholders, particularly authorities and regulators responsible 
for fuel supply in the power sector, to enhance the sustainable management of energy consumption. 
Biomass co-firing presents a promising future alternative renewable fuel for us, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. We are 
committed to increasing our biomass co-firing capacity to 5% in 2025, with a target of at least 15% by 2027.
Additionally, we continuously ensure that our business assets and operations are at optimal level to remain adaptable to evolving 
dispatch patterns, enabling efficient and responsive power generation.
Malakoff’s Biomass Co-firing: Reducing Coal Dependence
In May 2024, Malakoff took a pioneering step in Malaysia’s 
energy transition with the successful launch of its Biomass 
Co-firing Project at its 2,100 MW TBPP in Johor. As a key 
component of the NETR, the project integrates biomass 
co-firing alongside coal, progressively increasing biomass 
utilisation to reduce coal consumption in the power sector. 
At 2% biomass co-firing, the project reduces CO 2 emissions 
by approximately 755,000 tonnes per year. With full-phase 
implementation of 15% biomass co-firing with coal, the project 
is estimated to offset a significant amount of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO 2e) emissions, comparable to the impact of 
nearly 142 million matured trees planted. 
This shift not only brings substantial environmental benefits 
but also enhances agricultural waste management and 
strengthens the local economy. Aligned with Malaysia's 
commitment to a Just Energy Transition, it also promotes an equitable shift to a greener economy, inclusive opportunities, 
meaningful employment and addressing the Energy Trilemma of security, sustainability and affordability. In recognition 
of this milestone, Malakoff received the Forward Faster Sustainability Award in the category of Pioneer Sustainable 
Development Action Recognition from the United Nations Global Compact Network Malaysia & Brunei (UNGCMYB). This 
recognition is a testament to our efforts in championing this project and our commitment to the energy transition.

The energy sector remains the largest contributor to climate 
change, with CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion being a major 
driver. Despite global efforts to curb emissions, they continue to 
rise at an unsustainable rate.
Malaysia accounts for 0.7% of global CO₂ emissions from 
combustible fuels, with total emissions reaching 241.142 MtCO₂ 
in 2022. 1 Over the past two decades, emissions from fuel 
combustion in Malaysia have surged by 110% (2000-2022), 
reflecting the nation’s growing energy demands and reliance 
on fossil fuels. 2 This context underscores the urgent need for 
proactive climate action, particularly within the energy sector. 
Malakoff, as the country’s major industry player, has an 
opportunity to make a significant impact by advancing to 
sustainable energy solutions, reducing its carbon footprint and 
aligning with both national and global climate commitments. As 
the largest Independent Power Producer in Malaysia, we remain 
steadfast in our commitment to reducing GHG emissions through 
continuous investments in renewable energy projects and energy 
efficiency measures.
Our efforts extend beyond managing climate-related risks. 
Tracking and disclosing our emissions actively and transparently 
contributes to a sustainable future and demonstrates our 
commitment to environmental stewardship. These initiatives 
reflect our dedication to reducing our carbon footprint and 
fostering a culture of sustainability within our organisation.

 Waste Management and EffluentsM12
Effective waste management and the proper handling of effluents are crucial to minimising our environmental impact and promoting 
community well-being. We acknowledge the risks associated with poor waste management, including environmental pollution, 
adverse effects on public health, fines, punitive measures and reputational damage. 
As such, we remain dedicated to mitigating our environmental impact through sustainable practices, optimising resource efficiency 
and supporting the long-term health of ecosystems. Additionally, adopting circular economy initiatives enables us to tap into 
cost-saving opportunities, enhance efficiency and explore new revenue streams while maintaining compliance and fostering 
stakeholder trust.
Waste Management at Our Operations 
We remain committed to managing waste generated from our operations in compliance with the Environmental Quality Act 1974. 
Our waste management efforts are focused on scheduled waste across all our plants and are guided by the Group’s Environmental 
Policy and procedures. At our facilities, we produce a considerable volume of both scheduled and unscheduled waste. In managing 
scheduled waste, we engage licensed contractors for disposal at prescribed premises, ensuring full compliance with Department of 
Environment (DOE) regulations. This includes ensuring that all the scheduled waste maintenance sites utilised by TBPP, TBEPP, PPP 
and SEV meet the Environmental Quality Act (Scheduled Waste) Regulations 2005. To continuously improve our scheduled waste 
management practices, we conduct regular internal audits and site inspections.
Scheduled Waste
We continue to manage our scheduled waste, including fly ash, bottom ash, used oil and chemicals from the power plant and 
incinerators, in strict accordance with our Scheduled Waste Management Policy. This policy provides a framework for maintaining 
consistent and best-practice approaches across the Group.
Furthermore, we ensure that our scheduled waste is safely stored at designated maintenance sites until it is collected by licensed 
contractors for proper disposal, in full compliance with the DOE regulations. This process is monitored through the DOE’s Electronic 
Scheduled Waste Information System, ensuring transparency, accountability and adherence to regulatory requirements.
At TBPP and TBEPP, we utilise life cycle assessment to analyse and evaluate potential alternatives for reducing, reusing and 
recycling waste. Licensed domestic contractors collect internally generated scheduled waste, such as used lube oil, distillates and 
contaminated solid waste, which is then directed to dedicated disposal methods including incineration, landfill, physical chemical 
treatment and solidification.
Unscheduled Waste
Our plants produce metal and rubber waste, which are gathered in scrapyards and are responsibly disposed of by licensed 
contractors. In our offices, we encourage recycling among employees through strategic placements of recycling bins.

generation and improve resource efficiency. Through these efforts, we strive to meet regulatory requirements, implement 
industry best practices, protect our natural resources and contribute to the well-being of our communities.
As the operator of an incinerator on Pangkor Island, we have 
adopted advanced technology that achieves zero leachate 
discharge. Our incineration process treats and reuses the leachate 
in the flue gas cooling process within the water quenching system. 
The treated leachate from our treatment plant is then utilised as 
one of the water sources to lower the flue gas temperature from 
approximately 850°C-1,000°C to around 200°C after combustion. 
This approach not only ensures zero leachate discharge but also 
supports the local community by mitigating the environmental 
impact associated with municipal solid waste.

 Coal Ash Management  M13
At Malakoff, responsible coal ash management is crucial to our environmental stewardship. Improper handling of coal ash can lead 
to soil and water contamination, posing significant environmental and health risks. To mitigate these risks, we adhere to stringent 
safety and regulatory standards.
However, coal ash also presents opportunities for repurposing, such as in the production of construction materials like cement and 
concrete. This not only reduces waste by diverting it from landfills, but also generates additional revenue streams. 
We are guided by DOE’s Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulations 2005 and our in-house guideline in managing our coal 
ash generated from the power plants. 
At TBPP and TBEPP, we have third-party offtake agreements with three (3) companies to recycle the ash generated from the Tanjung 
Bin Complex into construction material such as sand replacement, which is a common practice in Europe and Japan. We have 
recycled bottom ash and fly ash generated from TBPP and TBEPP as follows:
TBPP and TBEPP implemented the cradle-to-cradle life cycle process. In 2024, TBPP and TBEPP diverted 581,307 tonnes of bottom 
ash and fly ash from landfill, and managed to increase our recycling tonnage of fly ash and bottom ash by 17% from 2023. This is a 
testament of our continued commitment to efficient coal ash and waste management at our operations.
 The information and data above are also reflected in Waste Management and Effluents section on pages 138 to 140.
Going Forward  
Going forward, Malakoff remains committed to enhancing our coal ash management practices to ensure environmental safety and 
sustainability. We will continue to adhere to stringent regulatory standards and implement best practices for the safe handling, 
storage and disposal of coal ash. Additionally, we will continue to actively explore innovative opportunities for repurposing coal 
ash in construction materials and other applications, turning waste into valuable resources.

 Asset Life Cycle and Integrity  M15
At Malakoff, we believe proper management of power plant assets is essential for sustaining efficiency and extending their lifespan. A 
well-structured life cycle management approach ensures assets operate effectively while maintaining their integrity from installation 
to decommissioning. A structured approach also supports transition planning, allowing for a more strategic and sustainable shift in 
operations.
Poor asset management can lead to stranded assets over time, increasing financial and operational risks. Therefore, we are committed 
to strengthening our asset management practices via proper planning to extend asset life cycle, improve cost management and 
minimise disruptions while ensuring long-term business sustainability.
Our approach is centred around ensuring the operational reliability of our plants by implementing due diligence measures and planned 
maintenance outages. To this end, each power plant has a dedicated maintenance team responsible for managing and overseeing 
critical assets. These teams follow a structured maintenance strategy that combines predictive and preventive measures to detect 
and address potential issues before they escalate. When unexpected equipment failures occur, corrective maintenance is carried out 
promptly to restore operations and maintain asset integrity.
To illustrate our dedication to preserve our assets at its best condition, we have successfully extended three of our power plants’ PPA 
– Port Dickson Power Plant from 2016 to 2019, SEV Power Plant for another 10 years from 2017 to 2027 and PPP for a year from 
2024 to 2025 with an option for another one-year extension.  
All the extensions above go beyond the original 21-year PPA term. For Port Dickson Power Plant, we successfully decommissioned the 
facility and sold the plant’s assets to a buyer from Nigeria in 2021, showcasing that the assets were well maintained and continued 
to be operational even after its three-year extension. Additionally, we have successfully maintained and operated our GB3 Power 
Plant located in Perak for its full PPA term from 2001 to 2022. Its assets are currently under preservation while awaiting a decision 
on the next course of action. 
This achievement highlights our ability to effectively manage and sustain our assets beyond their expected operational lifespan, 
ensuring continued efficiency, reliability and value for all stakeholders while supporting the stability of the energy supply.

Water Management at our Power Plants
We employed continuous monitoring 
of raw water at TBPP by installing flow 
meters at submerged chain conveyer 
and blow-down tank. This ensured that 
daily consumption remained within 
normal thresholds and allowed for the 
identification of faults or defects in the 
systems. We also monitored condensate 
water make-up at TBPP. Through this 
monitoring system, swift corrective 
actions were taken whenever deviations 
occurred, minimising water wastage and 
maintained operational balance. 
Meanwhile, our efforts at TBEPP centred 
on reducing the frequency of flue gas 
desulfurisation gas gas heater washing, 
which contributed to a significant reduction 
in our water consumption. Similarly, 
the PPP focused on optimising auxiliary 
boiler operations to conserve water and 
improve overall system efficiency. At 
SEV, improvements in heat recover steam 
generator water blowdown operations 
effectively reduced water usage while 
maintaining operational reliability. 
Another key aspect of our monitoring 
efforts is seawater monitoring. We monitor 
seawater at the intake and release points 
in our plants, ensuring that the water 
temperature remains below 40ºC. This is 
crucial to prevent any negative impact on 
marine life and to maintain a sustainable 
balance in the surrounding ecosystems.
Furthermore, through Malakoff 
Environmental Solutions, we incorporate 
rainwater harvesting systems for 
housekeeping and landscaping purposes 
as well as implementing leachate waste 
treatment systems to reduce raw 
water consumption in incinerators for 
temperature control.

and a fun “senamrobik” (aerobics) session, ensuring participants remained engaged and motivated throughout the programme.
Saya Sayang Bumi Beach Plogging Programme in Kuantan, Pahang
The 2024 “Saya Sayang Bumi — Beach Plogging” programme, organised by Alam Flora at Pantai Pelindung, Kuantan, effectively 
raised environmental awareness and promoted responsible waste disposal. The event featured plogging, a combination of jogging and 
litter collection, which not only encourages civic duty and environmental consciousness but also offers health benefits to participants. 
By integrating waste disposal practices into recreational activities, the initiative helps create a safer and greener environment while 
fostering a caring attitude towards natural resources.
Alam Flora’s efforts are in line with the government’s goal of reducing recyclable waste sent to landfills by 2025 and support the SDG 
11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, reflecting the Group’s ongoing commitment to environmental management and sustainable 
community solutions. Additionally, Alam Flora has organised numerous cleanup programmes, successfully collecting over 150 tonnes 
of waste through more than 300 events in Kuantan.
In 2024, Beach Clean Up & Save Our Sea Programme achieved 
a significant environmental milestone, where more than 300 
volunteers, including 20 Malakoff employees collected 1,327 
kg of waste from the shores of Segari and Teluk Senangin 
in Lumut, Perak. This large-scale removal of debris plays a 
critical role in reducing pollution and safeguarding marine 
ecosystems, ultimately protecting wildlife from its harmful 
effects.
The plogging event saw the involvement of around 150 
participants from local communities, Unitar College, University

Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) remain critical to us at Malakoff because it keeps our employees and contractors safe while 
minimising disruptions to our daily operations. It enables us to reduce downtime caused by accidents and injuries, which improves 
overall operational efficiency. Additionally, our focus on OSH helps create a sustainable, safe and conducive work environment for 
both our people and contractors, enabling them to return home safely after work. 
We are committed to upholding the principles set out in the Occupational Safety and Health (Amendment) Act 2022 (Act A1648) 
(OSHA 2022). Our operations have attained the ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems certification, 
ensuring the highest standards are maintained across our businesses. This enables us to continuously improve our OSH performance, 
minimise the risk of work-related injuries and create a secure work environment for employees, workers and contractors.
OSH Management System 
We continue to maintain our OSH Management System to protect our people and ensure compliance to legal requirements and 
internationally recognised standards. Central to our system is the integration of best practices in risk management, such as hazard 
identification, risk assessment and the application of risk control measures, all aligned with ISO 45001.
The scope of safety implementation covers all employees, as outlined under Part VI General Duties and Rights of Employees of the 
OSHA 2022, specifically Section 2024, which mandates employees to take reasonable care for their own safety and health, as well 
as that of others. Both our employees and contractors are covered by our OSH Management System, as shown in the table below:

The effectiveness of our processes is evaluated and continually improved through inputs from incident investigations, S&H Committee 
meetings, internal and external audits and ongoing inspections and assessments across our operations. These results inform the 
refinement of our OSH Management System, ensuring it remains effective and responsive to emerging risks.
To facilitate the reporting of work-related hazards and hazardous situations, we provide the HOPe card system for workers to offer 
feedback and raise safety concerns. These reports are categorised as leading indicators or positive reporting, proactive measures 
taken by staff and contractors to address hazards before they escalate. We ensure that workers can report concerns without fear of 
reprisal, fostering an open environment for safety dialogue.

Effective stakeholder management ensures alignment with our company’s strategic direction, reinforcing long-term stability and 
business resilience. Engagement is more than communication. It involves understanding stakeholder expectations, addressing 
concerns and delivering value that supports sustainable growth.
Internally, employees benefit from transparency, participation in decision-making and a workplace that prioritises engagement, 
leading to higher job satisfaction and productivity. Externally, engaging with the government, clients, vendors, capital providers, 
investors and the community builds trust, strengthens cooperation and ensures regulatory compliance. Through value distribution, 
including dividends to shareholders, tax contributions to the government, competitive salaries for employees and payments to 
vendors, we generate economic impact while maintaining operational continuity.
A structured approach to stakeholder engagement strengthens financial performance, reduces risks and secures long-term support, 
reinforcing our commitment to sustainable value creation.

social inclusivity, health and economic growth within our energy strategies. Recognising that our employees are the backbone of 
our operations and with the energy sector accounting for 25% 1 of the total workforce in Malaysia, we are committed to upholding 
human and labour rights. This commitment is not only a moral and ethical obligation but also a critical component in achieving the 
policy’s ambitious goals. By prioritising these rights, we ensure that our operations contribute positively to the nation’s sustainable 
development and foster a resilient, equitable and prosperous society.
Our dedication to upholding human rights within our operations ensures that we are free from forced labour, child labour, 
discrimination, harassment and unfair practices. Additionally, promoting diversity and equal opportunity not only protects the well-
being of our employees but also plays a critical role in attracting top talent, driving business growth and maintaining our competitive 
edge in the market. Strong labour relations are also vital to our organisational success, influencing workplace harmony, satisfaction 
and productivity of our people. We cultivate a collaborative and respectful environment by adhering to labour laws and treating all 
individuals, including contractors, with dignity. This approach minimises conflicts, enhances stability and lays the foundation for our 
sustainable growth.

Labour Organization’s (ILO) Forced Labour Conventions and the 2014 Protocol, as well as complying with the Employment Act 1955 
and the Industrial Relations Act 1967, which prohibit such practices and provide effective reporting mechanisms.

We also focus on establishing fair and transparent recruitment 
practices, ensuring that all hiring processes are free from 
exploitation. We are steadfast in implementing rigorous 
monitoring, which allows us to identify and mitigate any risks to 
human rights or labour relations. To support workers who may 
have been subjected to forced labour, we are implementing due 
process mechanisms for effective remediation. 
Through regular and transparent reporting, including in our 
annual reports, we are building accountability and trust with our 
stakeholders. Additionally, we sustained our active participation 
in awareness campaigns that focus on preventing forced labour 
and promoting ethical practices across the industry. 
Minimum Notice on Operational Changes 
Building on our approach from 2023, we continued to provide 
employees with advance notice of any changes to their work 
location, roles or other employment-related matters across all 
operating sites. This practice continues into 2024, ensuring that 
operational changes are deliberated and negotiated between 
employee unions and management for a fair and structured 
transition.
The implementation of these changes takes effect upon reaching 
mutual agreement. As stipulated in Collective Agreements, 
the consultation and negotiation period was extended over six 
months. The notice period and related terms are outlined in 
Article 5: Date and Duration of Collective Agreement and Article 
15: Notice of Termination of Service of the Collective Agreement.
Maintaining Harmony Working Environment through 
Collective Bargaining  
We continue to uphold our employees’ right to participate in labour 
unions. With two in-house Unions, we are actively holding Joint 
Consultative Meetings on quarterly basis between Management 
and our two in-house unions in updating information, addressing 
matters related to the welfare of our employees with amicable 
solution, in line with local regulations. Throughout 2024, 33% 
of our workforce remained covered by Collective Agreements 
(2023: 32%), while we continued to establish fair employment 
terms for those not under such agreements. 
Diversity and Equal Opportunity
We believe that an inclusive and diverse workplace is fundamental 
to our success. Our commitment to equal opportunity ensures 
that all individuals are recognised for their skills, abilities and 
potential, with merit as the guiding principle. This approach not 
only enhances employee satisfaction but also strengthens our 
reputation as an employer of choice. 
By embracing a range of perspectives, backgrounds and 
experiences, we create an environment where creativity, 
innovation and collaboration can flourish. This diversity 
strengthens our ability to solve complex challenges and fosters a 
more resilient and dynamic talent pool.

adoption of the new minimum wages benefits more than 2,000 employees in Alam Flora. In addition, under the Collective Agreement, 
employees are entitled for yearly increment of wages regardless the company’s performance, provided that the employee did not 
have disciplinary issues throughout his/her year of service.

 Why It Is Important
Supply chain management is part and parcel of Malakoff’s plan to drive sustainable business growth, which is done via strategic 
sourcing and procurement practices. We believe local procurement strengthens economic resilience while enabling us to develop the 
community across our operations. Furthermore, having a systematic vendor engagement and transparent procurement processes 
allow us to establish long-term partnerships with our vendors based on ethical business conduct. For this reason, we remain 
committed to enhancing supply chain efficiency through our procurement management initiatives, ensuring sustainable development 
and equitable value distribution across our business ecosystem.
 Our Approach
The details and information presented in this section are limited to the scope of Procurement Management, as it is the most critical 
component of our supply chain management. 
Our Procurement Policy establishes integrity standards across procurement processes. In this regard, we build vendor trust through 
fair and transparent subcontracting and procurement methods. Furthermore, every transaction undergoes systematic verification 
to meet integrity requirements. Local vendor partnerships remain our priority where feasible, as we recognise our role in national 
development.
We recognise the importance of environmental assessments for vendors in supporting the sustainability of our business and ensuring 
they meet expected deliverables. To this end, we will continue to enhance these requirements and integrate them into the procurement 
process to strengthen environmental accountability across our supply chain.
Environmental Assessment
Our vendors are encouraged to integrate sustainable 
practices into their business operations and supply 
chains, focusing on reducing carbon footprints by 
among others, minimising emissions, enhancing recycling, 
using renewable resources and optimising transportation 
routes. We also encourage our vendors to uphold ethical 
business conduct, fair labour practices, transparency, 
integrity and other Environment, Social and Governance 
(ESG) principles, ensuring alignment with our commitment to 
sustainability and responsible business practices.
Social Assessment
We are cognisant of the importance of social 
assessment for vendors in making sure integral to 
the sustainability of our business. We are committed 
to Social sustainability efforts, particularly integrity, in all 
business dealings and stakeholder relationships. Vendors are 
required to comply with Malakoff’s Vendor Code of Conduct, 
which consists of integrity requirements.
 Our Initiatives
E-Auction Training for Vendors 
The E-Auction training for vendors is conducted 
as and when required through the online bidding 
platform to ensure that vendors are equipped with 
the necessary skills and knowledge to participate 
effectively.
Awareness Programme with Vendors
On 26 November 2024, Alam Flora Group Integrity 
& Governance held an Awareness Programme with 
vendors at Shah Alam Convention Centre. The 
programme aimed to strengthen understanding and 
adherence to integrity and governance principles 
among vendors.

 Community Impact   M19
 Why It Is Important
Community development represents fundamental drivers of 
Malakoff’s corporate sustainability strategy that enables us to 
create a positive social impact across our operations. We believe 
that strategic community engagement programmes strengthen 
stakeholder relationships, enhance corporate reputation 
and drive sustainable business growth while fulfilling social 
responsibilities. Furthermore, our multifaceted support initiatives 
foster local economic growth and improve the overall well-
being of communities that support our operations. We remain 
dedicated to strategic community partnerships that generate 
sustainable socio-economic benefits, ensuring long-term value 
creation for stakeholders and beneficiaries.
 Our Approach
Malakoff’s community engagement approach is guided by its 
ESG strategy, sustainability framework and Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) pillars, which provides a framework for 
meaningful and holistic community development. In addition, our 
internal policies and Standard Operating Procedures are certified 
under the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management System to ensure 
transparency and integrity in all aspects of our community 
investment.  
Furthermore, our environmental conservation and social 
development initiatives align with the UN SDGs 2030, promoting 
a recycling culture and sustainable waste management 
practices across Malaysia. Through Malakoff Environmental 
Solutions’ Communication, Education and Public Awareness 
(CEPA) strategy, we promote environmental responsibility 
and encourages recycling as an essential part of sustainable 
waste management. These efforts are complemented by 
community development programmes anchored in established 
ESG strategies and sustainability frameworks. The programmes 
target educational support, skills development, disaster relief 
and community enrichment to address socio-economic gaps in 
underserved communities. Our CSR pillars ensure the systematic 
delivery of meaningful community support across all operational 
areas.

 Good Governance and Corporate IntegrityM1
 Why It Is Important
Good governance and corporate integrity are critical to Malakoff. Having a good governance framework and ethical practices 
establishes stakeholder trust, mitigate operational risks, ensure regulatory compliance and safeguard corporate reputation. By 
implementing robust governance principles and ethical standards, we demonstrate accountability, foster a positive workplace culture 
and attract stakeholders who prioritise integrity. For this reason, we remain committed to upholding sound governance, ethics and 
integrity practices as we pursue sustainable growth in a dynamic business landscape.
 Our Approach
Our approach to good governance and corporate integrity are embedded in Malakoff’s organisational DNA. The framework is 
guided by established policies, structured frameworks and strategic guidelines that establish systematic protocols for transparency, 
accountability and ethical conduct across all operational levels.
The policies, frameworks and guidelines include:
Anti-Bribery & Corruption Management System 
(ABMS)
Our ABMS framework aligns with ISO 37001 standards to 
ensure comprehensive integrity measures across operations. 
We also established integrated policies to strengthen 
governance practices, including the Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption (ABAC) Policy, Corruption Risk Assessment, Internal 
Compliance Audit Protocol, Gift Policy and Whistleblowing 
Policy. These policies serve as a mechanism for effective 
bribery risk management and operational integrity assurance.
Adequate Procedure (TRUST Principles)
Malakoff’s Adequate Procedure framework aligns with Section 
17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 
(MACC Act) through the implementation of TRUST principles. 
The framework encompasses Top Management Commitment, 
Risk Assessment protocols, Undertaking of Control Measures, 
Systematic Review mechanisms and Training programmes. 
Implementing these principles enables effective corruption 
risk mitigation while reinforcing a culture of integrity and 
accountability in our operations.
Furthermore, we communicate our anti-corruption policies and procedures to all relevant stakeholders through various engagement 
channels. Within the organisation, the Board of Directors, Top Management, Senior Management, Middle Management, Executives 
and Non-Executive Employees receive communications through policy statements, email communications and company intranet 
platforms. They are also required to attend training sessions on anti-corruption on an annual basis. 
Similarly, Malakoff’s external stakeholders and business partners including suppliers and vendors receive information through 
awareness sessions, posters, banners and dedicated Vendor Day Awareness Sessions. These communication methods ensure 
comprehensive understanding and adherence to anti-corruption standards across internal operations and business partnerships.

 Our Initiatives
We implemented the following initiatives in 2024:
 Good Governance and Corporate IntegrityM1
ABAC Awareness Programme
We conducted continuous ABAC Awareness Training Programmes for our employees and other business associate 
throughout the year that focuses on anti-bribery and corruption to promote ethical conduct and strengthen vigilance 
against corrupt practices across the organisation.
Apart from that, we collaborated with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Kuala Lumpur to organise a session 
on Section 17A - Corporate Liability for Malakoff’s Board of Directors and Senior Management. The Board of Directors also 
affirmed their stance against bribery and corruption via the Corruption Free Pledge or Ikrar Bebas Rasuah. 
For vendors, Malakoff also conducted the Vendor Anti-Bribery and Corruption Awareness Session 2024 to brief vendors on 
anti-bribery regulations and compliance requirements.
Corruption Risk Register Online Database
We assessed the Corruption Risk related to our activities and registered it in our online database through the TricorRadar 
System to ensure effective monitoring and management of integrity and corruption-related risk.
Audit Programmes
In 2024, we conducted three audit programmes to ensure our operations adhere to our governance, ethics and integrity 
framework:
ABMS Internal Compliance Audit Third-Party Surveillance Audit 
(SIRIM) Group Internal Audit
Raising Awareness on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption among Our Stakeholders
At Alam Flora, our Integrity and Governance Unit (IGU) collaborated with the Procurement Department on 26 November 
2024 to organise an Awareness Programme for private contractors. The session ensured that contractors fully understood 
Alam Flora’s ABAC Policy, including key provisions and penalties under the MACC Act. During the programme, the contractors 
also signed the ABAC Pledge, reaffirming their commitment to ethical business practices. This initiative will be conducted 
regularly for all active contractors.
Alam Flora’s IGU also conducted an integrity awareness session during a tender pre-qualification evaluation briefing on 
18 December 2024 to reinforce ethical standards in the tendering process. The session covered confidentiality, ethical 
conduct, secure handling of tender documents and measures to prevent unauthorised access.
Furthermore, Alam Flora’s IGU continues to ensure that all employees, from General Service (G-level) staff to Top 
Management, receive structured integrity awareness training to reduce corruption risks.

Anti-corruption training for AFSB and AFES is tracked separately due to the need for a different approach. Starting in 2024, we 
introduced face-to-face training instead of online sessions, as it is more effective, especially to support employees and G-level staff, 
who make up 91% of the total workforce. We also implemented roll call sessions to improve engagement and ensure that G-level 
employees receive proper guidance on integrity-related matters. In total, 440 employees attended the training, with the breakdown 
by employee category as follows:

Forward Faster Sustainability Award 2024
 Our Achievement
We are proud to announce Malakoff’s recognition at the United 
Nations Global Compact Network Malaysia & Brunei (UNGCMYB) 
Forward Faster Sustainability Award 2024, for The Forward 
Faster Sustainability Award for Anti-Corruption in the Large 
Company category. The recognition ceremony, held at Grand 
Hyatt Kuala Lumpur, validates our strategic commitment to 
governance excellence, positioning Malakoff as an industry 
leader in Malaysia’s evolving corporate integrity landscape.
Our commitment to excellence is reinforced through adherence to 
international standards, particularly the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery 
Management System (ABMS) and ISO 31000 Enterprise Risk 
Management Guideline certification. Furthermore, we continue 
to elevate integrity standards by aligning with the National Anti-
Corruption Plan (NACP) under the guidance of our IGU.
Our dedication to upholding governance and integrity was further 
recognised at the Anugerah Integriti, Governans dan Anti Rasuah 2023 (AIGA 2023), where we received the Gold award for 
our strong anti-corruption framework and ethical business practices. Organised by the Malaysian Institute of Integrity, this 
recognition highlights our effective implementation of the ISO 37001 ABMS and ISO 31000 Enterprise Risk Management 
Guideline, alongside the structured oversight of our IGU. The award was presented to us on 1 March 2024.
This achievement reflects our ongoing efforts to embed integrity in our corporate governance practices. AIGA 2023 serves 
as a platform to encourage ethical business conduct and foster healthy competition among public and private sector entities. 
By reinforcing the principles of transparency and accountability, we continue to strengthen our role in advancing Malaysia’s 
position in the Corruption Perceptions Index and promoting a corporate environment built on integrity.
Going Forward  
Moving forward, we will continue to develop the Malakoff Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan to strengthen our governance 
framework and integrity standards. This plan aligns with the NACP 2019–2023 which sets a clear measure to address corruption 
risks across our operations. At the same time, we are reviewing our Anti-Corruption Plan to ensure it aligns with the National 
Anti-Corruption Strategy 2024–2028 which focuses on improving anti-bribery efforts to enhance governance and integrity.

 Regulatory Compliance   M2
 Why It Is Important
At Malakoff, regulatory compliance helps us maintain high standards in our operations and governance practices. Our compliance 
frameworks and monitoring systems protect stakeholder interests and corporate reputation while managing risks effectively. Non-
compliance can result in fines, sanctions, financial costs for rectification and, in severe cases, temporary or permanent closure of 
operating sites. It may also lead to reputational damage and potential health and safety risks for employees, workers and the local 
community.
Adhering to regulatory requirements ensures accountability and ethical conduct across our operations. Strong compliance safeguards 
our reputation, enhances employee morale and productivity, supports smooth and efficient business operations and strengthens 
trust with regulatory bodies and the wider community. For this reason, we remain committed to strengthening our compliance 
standards and ensuring sustainable growth as regulations evolve.
 Our Approach
We adopt a proactive approach to regulatory compliance. Our Board of Directors and Senior Management are dedicated to ensuring 
that all operations comply with relevant laws and regulations. We have established a robust compliance framework that includes 
regular audits, risk assessments and continuous monitoring of regulatory changes. This framework is designed to identify and 
mitigate compliance risks effectively. 
We also implemented quarterly action plans to mitigate strategic and operational risks, alongside quarterly safety performance 
reviews of local operating assets. Internal audit reports from the Board Audit Committee provide additional oversight on operational 
governance and internal control systems.
 For more information on Malakoff’s compliance practices, refer to the Corporate Governance Overview Statement on pages 228 to 249.

 Grid Stability  
 Why It Is Important
The National Grid, which spans the entire Peninsular as the main transmission network, serves as a crucial backbone for meeting 
energy demand. Without a reliable grid system, electricity supply and other services could be disrupted. The National Grid is owned 
by Tenaga Nasional Berhad and overseen by the Grid System Operator (GSO). The GSO is responsible for the real-time operation 
and management of the Peninsular grid system, as well as short- and medium-term planning for both transmission networks and 
generation facilities to ensure efficiency and reliability. 
The National Energy Transition Roadmap aims to increase renewable energy (RE) installed capacity to at least 70% by 2050, making 
the transition to a sustainable energy mix a key priority. Achieving this target will require significant upgrades to grid infrastructure 
to support the integration of RE sources, while also accounting for long-term emissions from the energy sector. Major investments 
to the improvement of the National Grid’s infrastructure are expected to facilitate RE integration, connect new generation capacity 
to the grid and meet the rising demand for electricity, while improving energy efficiency and customer service. The initiative also 
includes the adoption of smart grid technologies, the replacement of outdated equipment, the reinforcement of power lines and the 
modernisation of substations to enhance overall grid stability and reliability.
 Our Approach
Although we are not directly 
responsible for managing the 
National Grid, we adhere to the 
Grid Code for Peninsular Malaysia, 
a regulatory instrument used 
to coordinate various electricity 
supply activities of the electricity 
producer, operator, distributor 
and the consumer; henceforth we 
have our role to play in ensuring 
the grid’s stability and reliability. 
By maintaining consistent and 
efficient power generation, reliable 
operations of our power plants 
prevent fluctuations that could 
disrupt the grid.
Effective coordination with the 
GSO is essential, as our power plant 
operators must respond to real-
time energy demands, ramping our 
generation up or down as needed 
to maintain the grid frequency and generation levels accordingly. Additionally, adherence to strict operational standards, regular 
maintenance and rapid response to unexpected issues all contribute to minimising the risk of grid disturbances. This commitment 
does not only improve the overall stability of our facilities but also ensures uninterrupted supply of electricity for the nation.
  For more information about our generated electricity to the grid which accounts for 25% of Peninsular Malaysia’s generated electricity, please refer to Business 
Review: Malakoff Energy on pages 108 to 122.

 Technology and Innovation   M18
At Malakoff, we are committed to implementing fit-for-purpose technology to protect business assets, safeguard stakeholder 
confidentiality and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. We believe in strengthening digital controls and investing 
in technology as a way to enhance information security, improve operational resilience and protect critical business infrastructure. 
While adopting new technology presents challenges such as rapid changes, implementation risks and uncertain returns, it also 
creates opportunities to boost efficiency, reduce costs, develop a competitive edge and reduce reliance on manual processes. To this 
end, we are committed to continuously refining data privacy and cybersecurity measures to ensure stakeholder information remains 
secure while supporting business sustainability in an increasingly digital landscape.
Our approach is centred around safeguarding data and security through regular risk assessments to identify and address potential 
vulnerabilities. By focusing on key risks and directing resources effectively, we strengthen our defences and ensure the resilience 
of our information assets. We also continuously refine our security controls to adapt to evolving threats, ensuring our protection 
measures remain effective and aligned with industry standards. We are guided by our internal policies, procedures and manuals 
under the Information Management.
Malakoff utilises an industry-standard Security Operation Centre (SOC), which plays a key role in protecting data privacy and ensuring 
robust security detection and response capabilities. Operating 24/7, the SOC is responsible for monitoring, preventing, detecting, 
investigating and responding to cyber threats in real-time.
By continuously monitoring devices and networks, the SOC identifies vulnerabilities and suspicious activities as they arise. The Virtual 
Log Collector compiles system logs from multiple sources, allowing for streamlined analysis and early threat detection. Extended 
Detection and Response strengthens the SOC’s ability to manage threats by integrating advanced analytics and security tools for a 
more proactive approach.
The SOC operates through three critical stages. Prevention and detection serve as the first line of defence, allowing risks to be 
identified early. This is followed by investigation, where advanced tools are used to assess and understand threats. The final stage is 
response, where measures are taken to mitigate risks, safeguard sensitive data and ensure business continuity.

Upgrading to ISO 27001:2022 Information Security Management 
Systems (ISMS) Certification
We have embarked on a strategic initiative to upgrade our ISO 27001:2022 
ISMS certification, strengthening our security frameworks, conducting 
comprehensive risk assessments and implementing best practices to align 
with the latest standards. By continuously improving our ISMS, we safeguard 
sensitive data, mitigate risks and reinforce trust with our stakeholders. We 
also conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to 
identify and address security weaknesses, strengthening our defences and 
ensuring comprehensive protection against cyber threats.
Leveraging Technology to Enhance Waste Management
At Alam Flora, we have been actively leveraging Geographic Information 
System (GIS) technology to enhance waste management efficiency and 
sustainability. Through our M Flora Telematics System, we introduced 
automated monitoring solutions that optimise waste collection routes and 
schedules, reducing fuel consumption and emissions while improving service 
delivery. This initiative aligns with the UN SDG No. 11, which focuses on building 
resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable urban development.
Malakoff Innovation Challenge 2024
The Malakoff Innovation Challenge 2024 was launched to encourage 
innovative thinking and promote sustainable cost optimisation among 
employees. Participating teams were required to submit proposals outlining 
problem statements, cost-saving targets and potential impacts on 
stakeholders. To support their efforts, teams received guidance from external 
innovation coaches and internal motivators, helping them refine ideas, set 
clear goals and develop practical solutions. Between March and September 
2024, participants focused on identifying cost-saving opportunities, analysing 
data and implementing strategies to achieve measurable results.
During the award ceremony, Malakoff recognised nine outstanding teams for 
their contributions and dedication throughout the challenge. Team Crush ‘Em 
received the top honour for their innovative solutions, followed by Team TBPP 
PMS in second place and Team TBE OPS 42 in third place.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues will 
be considered in making decisions aligned with Malakoff’s 
Sustainability Targets which focus on carbon emissions, 
renewable energy (RE) and waste management.
 Good corporate governance is crucial to keep the Group 
moving through the changing regulatory and market 
environment, which proved to be among the material matters 
raised by the stakeholders and maintaining sustainability in 
the long term. The Board views corporate governance as 
an integral part of the Group’s business strategy. Through 
prudent and effective controls, the Board continuously 
assesses and manages emerging risks and opportunities in 
ensuring long-term sustainable development and growth.
 The Directors are aware of their collective and individual 
responsibilities to all shareholders for the manner in which 
the affairs of the Company are managed, controlled and 
operated. The Board is satisfied that it has continuously 
fulfilled these duties and obligations during the year under 
review of which each Director has devoted sufficient time to 
effectively discharge his/her responsibilities. 
 The current composition of the Board has a blend of skills, 
experience and knowledge enabling them to provide effective 
oversight, strategic guidance and constructive challenge 
in examining, reviewing and deciding on Management’s 
proposals. The Managing Director & Group Chief Executive 
Officer (MD & GCEO) of the Company is empowered to 
implement strategies approved by the Board.
 The Board is governed by a Board Charter that defines its 
roles and responsibilities, the principles for Board’s operation, 
Board’s evaluation and remuneration, code of conduct and 
ethics and matters reserved for the Board. The Board reviews 
the Board Charter as required to ensure its relevance to the 
Company’s operating environment and compliance with the 
prevailing rules and regulations. 
 In addition to the Board Charter, the Company had adopted a 
Fit and Proper Policy in 2022 which enhances Board quality 
in the appointment and re-election of Directors of the 
Company. The Board Charter and Fit and Proper Policy are 
accessible through the Company’s website at https://www.
malakoff.com.my/corporate-governance. 
 Being a key policy of the Group, Limits of Authority 
(LOA) specifies the authority limits for the Board, Board 
Committees, Management Committee, MD & GCEO and 
Senior Management to facilitate compliance with good 
corporate governance principles. The Board retains the 
overall management and control of the Group’s business 
and affairs. The Board may, if necessary, revise the LOA to 
reflect the changes in the Group’s operating environment.

for the Group, and together with Management implements 
its policies and procedures which include among others

and third parties with proper avenue and procedures to 
disclose cases of improper conduct such as criminal offences, 
fraud, corruption, non-compliance to laws and regulations, 
breach of Group policies and Code of Conduct or other 
malpractices without fear of reprisal.
 A whistle-blower is assured confidentiality of identity and 
this includes protecting the whistle-blowers from detrimental 
actions within the Company, to the extent that is reasonably 
practicable, that may result from the disclosure of improper 
conduct, provided that the disclosure is made in good 
faith. The Whistleblowing Policy is also to ensure that fair 
treatment is provided to both the whistle-blower and the 
alleged wrongdoer upon disclosure of improper conduct.

 The Board practices a culture of open debate and raises 
challenging questions at meetings. Directors are impartial 
in their views, with the Company’s and stakeholders’ best 
interests at the forefront of every major decision. The robust 
and vigorous deliberations at Board and Board Committee 
meetings provide opportunities to all Directors to participate 
and contribute to the decision-making process as well as to 
ensure that the process of constructive and healthy dialogue 
is achieved. 
 Directors are well aware of their obligations to immediately

extent and nature of their interests in the transaction(s) at a 
Board meeting or as soon as the Directors become aware of 
the conflict of interest. The interested Directors will abstain 
from participating in the deliberation and Board decision on 
the matter.

 All Directors fulfilled the minimum attendance requirement 
of at least 50% of the Board meetings pursuant to Paragraph 
15.05(3)(c) of the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia.   
 The Board is committed to meet at least four times a year 
after the end of each financial quarter where the unaudited 
quarterly results would be reviewed and approved before 
being released to Bursa Malaysia. Meeting dates for the 
whole year are scheduled in advance and the calendar for the 
Board and Board Committees’ meetings is circulated to the 
Directors before the commencement of each financial year 
to enable the Directors to plan their schedule in advance.
 Supply and Access to Information
 Board papers are circulated to all Directors via a collaborative 
meeting software which allows the Board to securely 
access, read and review the Board/Committees documents. 
In addition, the usage of software eases the process of 
distribution of Board papers physically and minimises leakage 
of sensitive information. Every effort is made to ensure 
timely circulation of notices, agenda and meeting materials 
to the Board to enable the Directors to have sufficient time 
to prepare themselves for Board meetings and to facilitate 
effective Board discussion. 
 The Directors have direct access to the Management as well 
as Company Secretaries for their advice, and unrestricted 
access to any information relating to the Group to enable 
them to discharge their duties. The Directors, whether 
collectively as a Board or in their individual capacity, may 
seek independent professional advice at Malakoff’s expense 
in the discharge of their duties.
 The Management ensures that the presentations of proposals 
or updates to the Board are delivered in a manner with clear 
and adequate understanding of the subject matter. If there 
is any urgent matter or additional document not delivered 
within the reasonable timeframe, Management will explain 
the subject matter at the meeting.  
 All deliberations and decisions of the Board, including any 
dissenting views and Directors’ interests in any transaction 
with the Group who have abstained from deliberating and 
voting on a particular matter, are clearly recorded in the 
minutes of meeting. The minutes of meetings are circulated 
to the Board for review before the same are confirmed at the 
next Board meeting.

MCCG Practice Description
 The Group’s business and sustainability goals are aligned 
through our Sustainability Framework, for sharper focus 
to create value for critical areas involving our stakeholders 
and business. The sustainability goals will drive Malakoff’s 
sustainability performance throughout our business and 
strengthen the Group’s commitment to creating long-term 
value for our stakeholders. 
 We incorporate environmental considerations in the 
Group’s business strategy to maintain the Group’s long-
term competitive performance while safeguarding the 
environment and related communities. Integrating these 
considerations implies the Group’s operation in an ethical 
and responsible manner that provides reasonable assurance 
of its long-term financial viability.
 As a sustainably conscious organisation, Malakoff takes a 
three-pronged holistic approach towards sustainability. Our 
approach of embedding the triple bottom line into business 
operations, objectives and goals ensures that the Group will 
remain relevant in the longer term.
 The heightened materiality of sustainability to the business 
requires the Board to factor in sustainability components, 
risks and opportunities into its strategies at all times. The 
Board together with Management take responsibility in the 
establishment of the Company’s sustainability agenda and 
road map. Robust processes, controls and governance are 
in place to ensure transparent disclosures. There is greater 
Board oversight of ESG issues and greater accountability on 
matters pertaining to ESG. 
 The strategy and long-term vision are underpinned by the 
Company’s commitment to contribute to the greater good 
of our people and planet through responsible business 
practices and 13 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. As a leading player in the 
power and environmental services sector, the Group will 
continue to support the government’s initiatives in achieving 
the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) and towards being a carbon neutral nation 
by 2050.
 The Sustainability Framework defines primarily, the 
implementation of our sustainability strategy across the 
Group’s business and our commitment to environmental 
responsibility with carefully considered goals, programmes 
and business partners. Integrating ESG impacts involve 
amongst others, mitigating climate change risks, managing 
our facilities and conducting our business activities to 
minimise environmental impact.  
 The Board acknowledges that the Company’s financial 
outcomes are linked to our ability to manage ESG risks and 
opportunities as much as we recognise that an inclusive 
society build on human dignity and the responsible use of 
human capital is essential for all of us to thrive. 
 The well-being of customers, employees and other 
stakeholders as well as the environment is crucial to 
sustaining the Company’s long-term performance and 
continued relevance. The Board considers the integration 
of ESG factors as a component of the Board’s fiduciary 
responsibility, and accountable therefore to the oversight 
and management of sustainability. 
 The Sustainability Report for 2024 (refer to pages 123 to 205 of 
this Integrated Annual Report) sets out Malakoff’s commitment 
to improving the Group’s sustainability practices so that we 
are more competitive, resilient and adaptable to change. The

Sustainability Framework for the year under review.

Corporate Governance Overview Statement
II. Board Composition
 Independent Non-Executive Directors (INED)
 There are nine directors on the Board comprising eight non-
executive directors (NED) and one executive directors who 
is the MD & GCEO of the Company. Six out of the eight 
NEDs are INED and the remaining two are non-independent 
non-executive directors (NINED). Two new INED joined the 
Company on 1 June 2024 and 11 March 2025 respectively 
while one NINED and the Independent Non-Executive 
Chairman resigned on 2 December 2024 and 1 January 2025 
respectively. In this respect, the Company fulfilled Practice 
5.2 of MCCG 2021 for Large Companies to have a majority 
of independent directors (ID). With the current Board 
composition of more than 50% IDs on the Board, it has also 
met the requirement of MMLR of Bursa Malaysia. 
 The Board composition includes directors with various 
backgrounds, credentials, experience, knowledge and skills. 
This enables the Board to provide insights, perspectives 
and independent judgement to lead and steer the Group’s 
business.
 Whilst it is important to promote diversity, the normal 
selection criteria of a director based on an effective blend 
of competencies, skills, experience and knowledge in areas 
identified by the Board remain a priority. The Board is 
committed to ensure that its composition not only reflects 
diversity, but will also have the right mix of skills and balance 
to contribute to the achievement of the Company’s goals and 
objectives. The Board believes that the Board size is optimal in 
terms of number, diversity and length of service/experience. 
This Board composition is able to support objective and 
independent deliberation, review and decision-making to 
allow for a more effective oversight of Management.
 The Board acknowledges that NEDs may hold external 
directorships and other business interests. The Board reviews 
the declarations made by Directors on the number and nature 
of their external directorships. The Board has in place a set 
of procedures for Directors’ compliance/declaration of their 
potential external Board appointment to ensure that there is 
no potential conflict in the pending appointment. The Board 
has also adopted a Conflict of Interest Policy to manage any 
conflict of interest issue.
 The Board recognises the important contributions of INEDs 
for good corporate governance. Board decisions are made, 
taking into account the views of the INEDs as they carry 
substantial weight in ensuring that strategies proposed by 
Management are deliberated and examined for the best 
interests of the shareholders and stakeholders.
 The Board, save for the INEDs, has determined that the 
IDs have fulfilled the criteria under the definition of an ID 
as stated in the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia and are able to 
maintain their independent and objective judgements, and 
contribute positively to the business strategies, operations 
and corporate governance of the Company and the Group.
 Tenure of Independent Directors (ID)
 Under the Company’s Policy on INED Tenure, the tenure of IDs 
is limited to nine years with a provision for re-appointment 
subject to annual shareholders’ approval up to twelve years 
of service. Based on the assessment carried out for FY2024, 
the Board was satisfied that the length of service of IDs 
does not impair independent and objective judgement to be 
exercised by the IDs and for them to discharge their fiduciary 
duties in the best interests of the Company and the Group. 
 The cumulative term of service of each IDs for FY2024 is 
summarised below:

competitive advantage. These divergences allow for

the Board including gender, age and ethnic diversity.
 The criteria, process and requirements to be observed by the BNRC and the Board in carrying out their responsibilities on

Corporate Governance Overview Statement
 Appointment of Directors
 Appointment of directors and senior management is based 
on objective criteria, merit and with due regard for diversity 
in skills, experience, age, ethnicity and gender. Directors 
appointed should be able to devote the required time to 
serve the Board effectively. The Board should consider the 
existing Board positions held by a director, including on board 
of non-listed companies. 
 In identifying candidates for appointment of directors, 
the Board does not rely solely on recommendations from 
existing directors, management or major shareholders. The 
Board will utilise independent sources to identify suitably 
qualified candidates as and when required. If the selection of 
candidates is based on recommendations made by existing 
directors, management or major shareholders, the BNRC 
would assess and provide justification on the basis of the 
recommendation. 
 The Board ensures shareholders have the information they 
require to make an informed decision on the re-election 
and re-appointment of director(s). This includes details of 
any interest, position or relationship that might influence or 
reasonably be perceived to influence, in a material respect of 
their capacity to bring an independent judgement to bear on 
issues before the Board, and to act in the best interests of 
the Company as a whole. 
 Re-election and Re-appointment of Directors
 In accordance with Article 105 of the Company’s Constitution, 
one-third of the Directors for the time being shall retire by 
rotation at an annual general meeting (AGM) of the Company 
provided always that all Directors shall retire from office at 
least once in every three years and be eligible for re-election 
at the AGM. A Director retiring at the AGM shall retain office 
until the close of the meeting whether adjourned or not.
 In accordance with Article 111 of the Company’s Constitution, 
Directors appointed to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition 
to the Board shall hold office until the conclusion of the next 
AGM and be eligible for re-election.
 The Board at its meeting held on 21 March 2025 endorsed 
the recommendation of the BNRC for the following Directors 
to be considered for re-election pursuant to the relevant 
Articles of the Constitution at the Company’s forthcoming 
19th AGM. All Directors named below have offered themselves 
for re-election at the said AGM:
Article 
105
Dr. Norida Abdul Rahman
Datuk Prakash Chandran Madhu Sudanan
Dato’ Mohamad Razif Haji Abd Mubin
Article

Puan Lim Tau Kien
 In assessing Directors’ eligibility for re-election and re-
appointment, the BNRC considers their competencies, 
commitment, contribution and performance based on the 
Board’s annual evaluation, fit and proper assessment on the 
directors within the scope of the Company’s Fit and Proper 
Policy, and their ability to act in the best interest of Malakoff. 
The Directors’ rotation list was presented to the BNRC for 
endorsement prior to its recommendation to the Board for 
approval.
 Fit and Proper Policy (F&P Policy)
 Pursuant to the F&P Policy adopted by Malakoff on 30 June 
2022 that sets out the fit and proper criteria and due diligence 
process for appointment and re-election of directors, the 
directors standing for re-election at the forthcoming 19 th 
AGM had completed the Fit & Proper Declaration Form for 
review by the BNRC and Board. It serves as a guide for the 
BNRC and Board in evaluating the director for re-election to 
the Board.
 Other than new appointment and re-election of directors, 
the fit and proper assessment on a director may also be 
conducted at any time the Company becomes aware of 
information that may materially compromise a director’s 
fitness and propriety.

 Annual Evaluation
 The Board conducts an evaluation on the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and each individual director annually. 
For the financial year under review, the Board and Directors’ evaluation was conducted by the Corporate Secretarial team. 
 The Board evaluation focuses on the following six key parameters:
 A set of questionnaires was circulated for the Board and Board Committees evaluation. The results of evaluations were 
summarised and presented to the Board on 21 March 2025. As a whole, the evaluation results for the financial year under 
review demonstrated that the Board met the performance criteria required for an effective and committed Board. 
 Based on the results of the annual evaluation of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors for the year under 
review, the Board is able to gauge and put in place appropriate actions to address areas for improvement. The evaluation 
confirmed the strength of the Board and the high performing boardroom culture. Priority areas and key findings have since 
been incorporated in the action plans that would further improve the Board performance in the new financial year.
 
 Directors’ Training
 The Board recognises the importance of continuous training for Directors and encourages all Directors to attend appropriate 
programmes, courses and seminars to stay abreast on the relevant business development and industry outlook. This is to ensure 
Directors are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties and responsibilities. In addition, the 
Company organises an induction programme and orientation for new Directors on board.
 Saved for Dato’ Mohamad Razif Haji Abd Mubin who was appointed on 11 March 2025, all Directors have completed the Mandatory 
Accreditation Programme (MAP) as prescribed by Bursa Malaysia Securities, comprising Part I (Director’s Roles, Duties and 
Responsibilities) and Part II (Sustainability and Related Roles of a Director).
 During the financial year under review, all Directors attended at least one training/seminar/workshop and the summary of which

 Remuneration Policy
 The Board has remuneration policies and procedures to determine the remuneration of directors and senior management, 
considering the demands, complexities and performance of the Company as well as skills and experience required. The policies 
ensure remuneration level is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals with the required credentials, 
skills, talent and experience in the Board and Board Committees.
 The remuneration policies and practices reflect the different roles and responsibilities of NEDs, executive directors and Senior 
Management. These policies and procedures are periodically reviewed by the BNRC.
 The remuneration recommendation to the Board for the Company’s Directors and Senior Management shall be based on the 
following considerations:
(i) levels of remuneration structure are sufficient to attract and retain the individuals needed to run the Company successfully 
at the Board as well as senior management level;
(ii) links rewards to both the Company and individual performances, responsibilities, expertise and complexity of the 
Company’s activities;
(iii) aligns the interests of directors, senior management and our stakeholders with the business strategy and long-term 
objectives of our Company;
(iv) information obtained from independent remuneration sources within similar industry.
 Directors’ Remuneration

remuneration package for the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) and MD & GCEO to the Board. The Board has overall 
responsibility to approve the remuneration for these positions.
(b) Remuneration of the NEDs
 The remuneration package for NEDs reflects the individual’s merits, valuable contribution and level of responsibilities. 
The fees payable to NEDs are reviewed and determined by the Board with the recommendation of the BNRC. Individual

Corporate Governance Overview Statement
I. Board Audit Committee (BAC)
 The BAC assists the Board in carrying out its oversight responsibilities by reviewing financial information and providing an 
unbiased review on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Group’s internal controls. 
 The BAC is made up of four members, all of whom are IDs. The BAC is chaired by an INED who does not hold chairmanship on 
the Board. The BAC members possess extensive experience in finance and energy industry who could effectively contribute to 
business strategy and corporate governance discussions with shrewd business acumen.
Name of BAC Members Designation
Puan Lim Tau Kien (Chairman)  
Appointed on 1 July 2024 and redesignated as Chairman on 15 January 2025) Independent Non-Executive Director
Datuk Rozimi Remeli (Redesignated as Member on 15 January 2025) Independent Non-Executive Director
Datuk Prakash Chandran Madhu Sudanan Independent Non-Executive Director
Datuk Wira Roslan Ab Rahman Independent Non-Executive Director
Datuk Ooi Teik Huat (Ceased on 2 December 2024) Non-Independent Non-Executive Director
 All BAC members are financially literate and have sufficient understanding of the Group’s business. This enables them to 
continuously apply a critical and probing view on the Group’s financial reporting process, transactions and other financial 
information, and effectively challenge Management’s assertions on the Company’s financials.
 The roles and responsibilities of BAC are as follows:
1. assist the Board in fulfilling its statutory and fiduciary responsibilities in examining and monitoring the Company and its 
subsidiaries’ management of business, financial risk processes, accounting and financial reporting practices;   
2. determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the administrative, operational and internal accounting controls of the Group 
and to ensure that the Group is operating in accordance with the prescribed procedures, code of conduct and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements;   
3. serve as an independent and objective party from management in the review of the financial information of the Company 
and Group presented by management for circulation to shareholders and the general public;   
4. provide direction and oversight of the internal and external auditors of the Company to ensure their independence from 
management; and
5. evaluate the quality of audits conducted by the internal and external auditors on the Company and Group.
 With the enhancements to COI disclosure for listed companies as mandated by Bursa Malaysia, the role of BAC is expanded 
to review and report to the Board, any COI situation together with the measures taken to resolve, eliminate or mitigate such 
conflicts.   
 The Company has a policy that requires a former partner of Malakoff’s external auditors to observe a cooling-off period of at 
least three years before his/her appointment as a member of the BAC. This requirement is included in the TOR of BAC. To date, 
none of the BAC members has been a former key audit partner of the Company. 
 The BAC report for the financial year 2024 has been reviewed by the BAC to ensure its compliance with the relevant regulatory 
requirements and guidelines.

Corporate Governance Overview Statement
 Review of External Auditors
 The BAC has policies and procedures to assess the suitability, 
objectivity and independence of the external auditors to 
safeguard the quality and reliability of audited financial 
statements. 
 Evaluation of the external auditors is conducted annually 
based on their experiences, capabilities, audit approach and 
independence prior to recommending their appointment 
or re-appointment to the shareholders for approval. The 
evaluation includes review on the auditors’ service levels and 
any significant changes to their scope of work to address 
new business developments, for recommendation of their 
re-appointment to the BAC. 
 External auditors are evaluated on their objectivity 
and independence, technical competency and ability, 
understanding of the Group’s businesses and industries, 
resources assigned and capability of the engagement team 
as well as making recommendations in areas in need of 
improvement. 
 The BAC considers the information presented in the Annual 
Transparency Report of the audit firm on matters covered 
therein including the audit firm’s governance, leadership 
structure and measures undertaken by the audit firm to 
uphold audit quality and manage risks.
 Policies are in place for any non-audit services proposal by 
external auditors to be presented to the BAC to ensure the 
auditors’ independence is maintained.

BAC Report section in this Integrated Annual Report.  
 Internal Audit
 The Group Internal Audit (GIA) supports the Board through the 
BAC in discharging its duties and governance responsibilities 
of maintaining a sound internal control system within the 
organisation. The internal audit function is considered an 
integral part of the assurance framework and GIA’s mission is 
to enhance and protect organisational value by providing risk-
based and objective assurance, advice and insight. At the same 
time, GIA also assists the BAC and Management to achieve 
the Company’s goals and objectives by bringing a systematic 
and disciplined approach in evaluating and improving 
the effectiveness of internal control, risk management, 
whistleblowing and governance processes within the Group.
 With its independent status within the Group, GIA reports 
directly and functionally to the BAC and administratively 
to the MD & GCEO. GIA is also independent of the activities 
and functions that it audits and performs its duties in 
accordance with the Internal Audit Charter, as approved by 
the BAC, which establishes the framework for the effective 
and efficient functioning of GIA. The BAC also reviews and 
approves the appointment and removal of the Chief Internal 
Auditor, performance evaluation, Annual Internal Audit Plan, 
budget and organisation structure of GIA to ensure that it 
is adequately resourced with competent staff to perform its 
role and function effectively.
 The standards and practices adopted by GIA are aligned with 
the International Professional Practices Framework issued by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors. As at 31 December 2024, 
the total number of personnel in GIA was nine including 
the Chief Internal Auditor. The name, credential and work 
experience of the Chief Internal Auditor of GIA are disclosed

Integrated Annual Report.
 Financial Reporting
 Financial procedures and standards have been put in place 
to assist the Board in discharging its duty of ensuring that

purposes of timely reporting of its financial statements. 
Ultimately, this results in better stakeholder communication 
enabling them to have informed assessment of Malakoff’s 
performance and future prospects.
 For the year under review, no accounting irregularities were 
reported by either internal or external auditors.
II. Risk Management and Internal Control
 The Board has established BRIC to oversee the Group’s overall 
risk management and integrity policies and frameworks, 
and to assess major investments by the Group. The BRIC 
consists of four members, with three members who are 
INED, with diverse background. Each BRIC member has vast 
management experience, in-dept knowledge of the industry 
and integrity.

(e) Discussed and reviewed the results of the annual assessment evaluated by the BAC and Management in respect of the 
quality of audit, covering the External Auditors’ performance, suitability and its independence as the Company’s External 
Auditors for FY2024. The results of the assessment for FY2024 were noted by the BAC and KPMG was recommended for 
re-appointment as the External Auditors of the Company for FY2024. The Board at its meeting held on 21 March 2025 
approved the BAC’s recommendation for re-appointment of KPMG, subject to the shareholders’ approval being obtained at 
the forthcoming 19 th  Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company; and
(f) Held two (2) private sessions with the External Auditors in February and November 2024, without the presence of the 
Management. The meetings provided an open and unrestricted forum for the External Auditors to discuss with the BAC the 
areas of concern and findings related to the Group’s financial statements for the attention of BAC.
 The fee for non-audit services provided by KPMG for FY2024 amounted to RM71,970 which was approved by the Chief 
Financial Officer in line with Clause 7.4.1 of the non-audit services policy of the Company. The non-audit services were 
mainly related to tax compliance services and agreed-upon procedures to verify compliance of financial covenants by certain 
subsidiaries of the Group.
 KPMG also, pursuant to the Company’s policy on non-audit services, had undertaken the necessary measures to ensure that 
each non-audit service engagement would not result in conflict of interest nor impair their independence and objectivity. 
Management had also ensured that necessary safeguards were in place when engaging KPMG to carry out non-audit services 
for the Group. With the measures taken by KPMG and Management, the BAC was satisfied that the non-audit services 
provided during the FY2024 complied with the applicable rules and standards of independence for auditors, as well as the 
provisions stipulated in the non-audit services policy.
 KPMG had provided a written assurance to the BAC that they had implemented a number of firm wide ethics and independence 
systems to monitor compliance with their policies in relation to independence and ethics and had been independent 
throughout the audit engagement for FY2024.

 The BAC had reviewed and recommended related party transactions (RPTs) and recurrent related party transactions (RRPTs) 
entered into with the Company’s related parties in accordance with the policies and procedures of the Company, for the Board’s 
approval, to ensure that the transactions were fair and reasonable, undertaken in the Company’s best interest and on normal 
commercial terms as well as not detrimental to the interest of the minority shareholders.
 
 The Group’s RPTs and RRPTs for the preceding 12 months up to each reporting quarter as well as the forecasted RPTs and RRPTs 
for the next 12 months period from the quarterly reporting period were also reported to the BAC and the Board on a quarterly 
basis. The reporting of these transactions by the Group was coordinated through the Corporate Secretarial Department with all 
the respective subsidiaries, departments and business units within the Group, before the same were collated and presented to 
the BAC and the Board. The threshold limits of the RPTs and RRPTs were also monitored accordingly to ensure compliance with 
the MMLR.
 The GIA also assists the BAC by conducting reviews of the Group’s RPTs and RRPTs to provide assurance that the transactions 
reported to the BAC were accurate, complete, in compliance with the MMLR and undertaken on arm’s length basis and on normal 
commercial terms.

value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight. At the same time, GIA also assists the BAC and Management 
to achieve the Company’s goals by bringing an objective and disciplined approach in evaluating and improving the effectiveness of 
internal control, risk management, whistleblowing and governance processes within the Group. This function serves as an important 
source of support for the BAC in identifying weaknesses or deficiencies in internal processes and to facilitate appropriate remedial 
measures to be taken by the Company.
The purpose, authority, responsibility, independence and objectivity of GIA are formally defined in the IA Charter, as approved by the 
BAC, which establishes the framework for the effective and efficient functioning of GIA. The standards and practices adopted by GIA 
are aligned to the International Professional Practices Framework issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors.
GIA has an independent status within the Group and is independent of the activities and functions that it audits. GIA reports directly 
and functionally to the BAC and administratively to the MD & GCEO. The BAC also reviews and approves the appointment and removal 
of the Chief Internal Auditor, performance evaluation, Annual IA Plan, budget and organisational structure of GIA to ensure that it is 
adequately resourced with competent staff to perform its role and function effectively and independently.

Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
MANAGEMENT’S & BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITY
The Management is accountable to the Board to ensure effective 
implementation of risk management and internal controls. The 
Management formulates and oversees the risk management 
policy, frameworks and guidelines, including their implementation 
across the Group. The risks are reviewed and actions to mitigate 
the identified risks are then recommended. The Management 
also assigns accountabilities and responsibilities at appropriate 
levels within the Group as well as ensuring that all the necessary 
resources are allocated to manage those risks.
The Board is responsible for the overall tone and culture towards 
an effective risk management and internal control system in the 
Group. The Board is also responsible for reviewing the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal 
control processes. The Group’s risk management process is 
designed such that all key risk areas are effectively managed to 
enable the Group to achieve its business objectives. The Board 
is aware that the risk management and internal control systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
the risk of material loss or the occurrence of unforeseeable 
circumstances.
MANAGING RISK
The Board acknowledges that risk management is fundamental 
in protecting and safeguarding the interests of the Group and 
its shareholders to ensure sustainable growth to the Group. The 
Group's risk management process is guided by the Enterprise 
Risk Management Policy and Framework (ERMPF) and ISO 
31000:2018 Risk Management Guidelines.
The Board Risk and Investment Committee (BRIC) oversees 
the Group’s risk oversight responsibilities and the overall risk 
management across the Group. At the management level, 
the Management Risk Committee (MRC) supports the BRIC in 
integrating risk management strategies as well as reviewing 
the application of risk management process across Malakoff 
Corporation Berhad, in accordance with the ERMPF. At the 
operational level, risks are managed at the respective power 
plants through the Plant Risk Committee (PRC). The ERMPF has 
been revised in 2020 to reflect the changes from the updated 
version of ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Guidelines. 
The risk management process can be summarised below:
Scope, Context, and Criteria
Risk Recording and Reporting
Risk Monitoring and Review
Risk Treatment
Risk Assessment
Risk Identification
Risk Analysis
Risk Evaluation
Figure 1: Risk Management Process
The Board of Directors (Board) of Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Malakoff or Company) is committed 
to maintaining an effective risk management and internal control system at Malakoff Corporation 
Berhad and its subsidiaries (Malakoff Group or Group). 
The Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control is made in accordance with Paragraph 
15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa 
Securities) and the revised guidelines on the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - 
Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers. This is also in line with the Malaysian Code on Corporate 
Governance (MCCG) 2021, which requires public listed companies to maintain a sound system of risk 
management and internal controls to provide assurance and safeguard shareholders’ investments, 
customers’ interests and company’s assets.

Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
The Group defines risk as event that could affect the achievement of its objectives. It is measured by the likelihood of the risk 
occurring and the impact if the risk occurs. The ERMPF ensures that the risk assessment process of identifying, analysing, evaluating, 
risk treatment and risk mitigation are in place to protect the Group from material losses. It will assist the Group in making decisions 
and prioritising the implementation of the risk mitigation plan.
 
The risk matrix below depicts the likelihood and impact parameters used to measure and assess the Group’s risk level:
Likelihood/Impact Insignificant Minor Moderate Major Catastrophic
Almost Certain 6 7 8 9 10
Likely 5 6 7 8 9
Possible 4 5 6 7 8
Unlikely 3 4 5 6 7
Rare 2 3 4 5 6
Figure 2: Risk Matrix
Risk Management Process
A Corporate Digital Assurance module is used in the Enterprise Risk Management System (ERMS) to enhance the Group’s risk 
management implementation. The scorecard owners, risk owners, control owners and action plan owners are required to provide 
assurances with respect to the status of all material risks, controls and management actions on a quarterly basis.
The assurances serve as proof that the owners have reviewed the registered controls and updated the Corporate Risk Scorecard 
System with the status of all material risks, controls and management actions.
In relation to the risk management process, the owners also certify that:
The risks, controls and 
management actions 
information within the 
Corporate Risk Scorecard 
are accurate and up-to-
date.
Where exposure is 
considered acceptable, 
they have documented and 
validated that the controls 
are in place and effective.
Where risks are assessed as 
unacceptable, management 
actions have been identified, 
including the owners and 
due dates to address the 
risks.
To the extent that risks are 
perceived to be not within 
their control (either directly 
or as delegated to the 
immediate Management 
team), it will be documented 
and escalated to the 
appropriate level of 
Management within the 
Group.
In addition, the owners also confirm that the risk management process has been complied with and the information for which they 
are responsible for under the Corporate Risk Scorecard fairly reflects the position of the Group.

Risk Governance
On a quarterly basis, the identified risks are presented and deliberated at the MRC meeting chaired by the Managing Director and 
Group Chief Executive Officer (MD & GCEO). The report is subsequently tabled to the BRIC for deliberation and recommendations to 
the Board. The Board notes the report on the risks and the actions taken by the Management to mitigate the risks. The overview of 
the Group’s risk reporting structure is set out below:

Figure 3: Risk Governance
Risk management is integrated into the Group’s day-to-day business activities, while risk-based evaluation is incorporated into its 
decision-making process. This demonstrates the emphasis placed by the Board on the risk management agenda and underlines 
the importance of a well-managed risk management program. In line with this, the MRC continues to reinforce risk management 
importance among employees to ensure continuous improvement at all levels.
Emerging Risks
Based on Global Risks Report 2024 published by World Economic Forum, issues like ESG and cybersecurity threat have triggered 
organisations to strategise and put more emphasis on these topics. In view of this, the risks related to these issues have been 
deliberated in the risk management process through the MRC and BRIC. In addition to this, the Group has implemented several 
measures in line with the ERMPF regarding its operations which can be summarised as follows:
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Assurance
 
The Group has zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption and has accordingly put in place the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery 
Management System (ABMS) to ensure that risks related to bribery and corruption are systematically managed. 
The objective of the system is to assist the Group in mitigating the risks of involvement in bribery whilst promoting trust and confidence 
in business dealings, as well as enhancing integrity among all employees. The Group’s ABMS has been audited and certified to ISO 
37001:2016 by SIRIM QAS International Sdn. Bhd. since 2020. One of the key components in the system is the development of the 
bribery risk register to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's current controls to mitigate bribery issues. Amongst 
the controls that have been established are the Whistleblowing Policy, Group Code of Conduct and Limits of Authority (LOA).
Monitoring of information and operational technology 
system, cybersecurity and threat.
Monitoring of  ESG issues by Management Sustainability 
Committee, BRIC and Board.

Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The key features of the Group’s control structure that provide 
reasonable assurance against the occurrence of events that could 
prevent the achievement of business objectives are as follows:
The Board
The Board of Malakoff Corporation Berhad provides direction 
and oversight on internal controls. The terms of reference and 
responsibilities are defined together with the Board Charter. The 
specific lines of responsibility, accountability and delegation 
of authority as approved by the Board to facilitate the Group’s 
operations are the obligations of the MD & GCEO and MRC.
Business Plan, Budget and Reporting
Malakoff Corporation Berhad develops annual business plans 
and budgets prepared by the Management and approved by the 
Board before the commencement of the new financial year.
The Board reviews the actual results against budget on a 
quarterly basis in conjunction with the public announcement 
of the Group’s quarterly financial results under the Main Market 
Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities.
The Board is also updated with the latest sustainability trends, 
progress of the Group’s ESG roadmap, key sustainability 
achievements and new developments within the sustainability 
space, covering material risks and opportunities, through annual 
ESG reporting from the Management.
Policies and Procedures
Documented internal policies and procedures are in place to 
ensure compliance with internal controls and the relevant rules 
and regulations. They are reviewed regularly to ensure that any 
gaps in controls are addressed  and where required, policies 
and procedures are revised to align with the prevailing business 
conditions.
Limits of Authority (LOA)
The LOA set out the level of authority under key business areas 
(financial and non-financial) of the Group. The authority limits in 
respect of organisational requirements such as procuring goods 
and services, cash transactions and contracting are clearly 
defined and documented. The limits are reviewed and updated 
regularly to reflect the current business environment, operational 
and structural changes, if any, of the Group.
Internal Audit 
The Group Internal Audit (GIA) provides assurance on the 
existence, adequacy and effectiveness of internal control, 
risk management, whistleblowing and governance processes 
designed to improve and add value to the Group. This function 
serves as an important source of support for the Board Audit 
Committee (BAC) in identifying weaknesses or deficiencies in 
internal processes and facilitating appropriate remedial measures 
to be taken by the Group.
GIA reports directly and functionally to the BAC and 
administratively to the MD & Group CEO. GIA is independent from 
the functions and activities that it audits and performs its duties 
in accordance with the Internal Audit Charter as approved by the 
BAC and the International Professional Practices Framework by 
the Institute of Internal Auditors.
Details of the internal audit function and activities are presented in 
the BAC Report on pages 250 to 256 of this Integrated Annual Report.
Whistleblowing
The Group’s Whistleblowing Policy sets out avenues for employees 
and third parties dealing with the Group with proper procedures 
to disclose cases of improper conduct such as criminal offences, 
fraud, corruption, breach of Group policies and Code of Conduct, 
or other malpractices.
A whistleblower is assured confidentiality of identity to the 
extent reasonably practicable. This includes protecting the 
whistleblowers from detrimental actions within the Group that 
may result from the disclosure of improper conduct, provided 
that the disclosure is made in good faith. The Whistleblowing 
Policy is also to ensure that fair treatment is provided to both the 
whistleblower and the alleged wrongdoer when a disclosure of 
improper conduct is made.
Disclosure of improper conduct can be made verbally or in writing 
to the Chairman of the BAC and the Chief Internal Auditor via 
letter or e-mail to [whistleblowing@malakoff.com.my].
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy
The  'Anti-Bribery  Policy'  was  initially  approved  and  adopted  on 
3  October  2019.  Subsequently,  the  policy  underwent a review 
and revision to include the term 'Anti-Corruption,' resulting in the 
updated policy named 'Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.' 
This revised policy was approved on 28 August 2023 to align with 
the requirements of ISO 37001:2016.
Integrated Annual Report 2024
261
COMMITMENT TO STRONG GOVERNANCE

---- Page 264 ----
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
The implementation of the policy will further strengthen the 
Group’s corporate governance and ensure commitment from all 
stakeholders to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct, 
integrity and accountability in all business activities and operations 
of the Group. This is also in line with Section 17A of the MACC 
Act 2018 (the Act), which requires commercial organisations to 
establish adequate procedures to avert corruption.
Joint Ventures and Associates
Malakoff Corporation Berhad ensures that investment and 
interest in material joint ventures and/or associates are protected 
by having board representation at the respective joint ventures 
and/or associates. The management of the joint ventures and/or 
associates are also responsible for overseeing the operations and 
performance of the joint ventures and/or associates.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
EFFECTIVENESS
The Board reviews the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control system through the following monitoring and 
assessment mechanisms:
• A quarterly review of the Group’s actual financial and 
operational performance against planned performance and 
other key financial and operational performance indicators.
• Risk, Process Improvement & Integrity Department presents 
the Risk Management Report to BRIC every quarter to provide 
an overview of the Group’s key risks and action plans for 
mitigating the risks. The BRIC provides its views, which are 
then communicated to the respective risk owners by the Risk, 
Process Improvement & Integrity Department. The report is 
then escalated to the Board upon deliberation by BRIC.
• BAC deliberates and discusses reports issued by the Group 
Internal Audit and external auditors pertaining to financial, 
operational, governance, risk management and internal 
control matters. The status of preventive and corrective 
actions for issues discussed is also updated in BAC to enable 
monitoring of the actions.
COMMENTARY ON ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS
The risk management and internal controls defined above have 
been in place for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of this statement for inclusion in the annual report.
In making this statement, the Board had received assurances from 
the MD & GCEO, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President 
of Corporate Services & Integrity Division, Head of Risk, Process 
Improvement & Integrity Department and Group Internal Audit 
that the risk management and internal control processes are 
operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects for 
the reporting period.
The Board is of the opinion that risk management and internal 
control are adequate and effective in providing reasonable 
assurance for the year under review.
There was no major internal control weakness identified during 
the year under review that may result in any material loss that 
would require disclosure in this statement.
REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control pursuant to the scope set 
out in Audit and Assurance Practice Guide (AAPG 3), Guidance 
for Auditors on Engagements to Report  on  the  Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control included in the Annual 
Report issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) 
for inclusion in the annual report of the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2024, and reported  to  the  Board that nothing 
has come to their attention that causes them to believe that the 
statement intended to be included in the annual report of the 
Group, in all material respects:
(a) has not been prepared in accordance with the disclosures 
required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of 
Listed Issuers; or
(b) is factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether 
the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management and Internal 
Control covers all risks and controls or to form an opinion on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control system, including the assessment and opinion 
by the Board and Management thereon. The auditors are also 
not required to consider whether the processes described to deal 
with material internal control aspects of any significant problems 
disclosed in the annual report will, in fact, remedy the problems.
This statement is made in accordance with the resolution of the 
Board dated 21 March 2025.

Directors’ Report 
For the Year Ended 31 December 2024
Other statutory information
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain 
that:
i) all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts, and
ii) any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business have been written down to an amount 
which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
i) that would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts in the Group and in 
the Company inadequate to any substantial extent, or
ii) that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
misleading, or
iii) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the 
Company misleading or inappropriate, or
iv) not otherwise dealt with in this report or in the financial statements that would render any amount stated in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
i) any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year and which secures 
the liabilities of any other person, or 
ii) any contingent liability in respect of the Group or of the Company that has arisen since the end of the financial year.
No contingent liability or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable 
within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially 
affect the ability of the Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.
In the opinion of the Directors, except for the compensation from settlement of final insurance claims amounting to RM92,825,000 
and impairment loss on investments in subsidiaries amounting to RM137,105,000 as disclosed in Note 29 financial statements, the 
financial performance of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 has not been substantially 
affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature nor has any such item, transaction or event occurred in 
the interval between the end of that financial year and the date of this report.
Significant and subsequent events
Significant and subsequent events during the year are disclosed in Note 40 to the financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
(d) Use of estimates and judgements
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with MFRS Accounting Standards requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
 There are no significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than the following:
(i) Residual values of power plant and machinery
a) Gas-fired power plant
 Estimating the residual values of power plant and machinery involves significant judgements, selection of 
variety of methods and assumptions that are normally based on market conditions existing at the balance sheet 
date. The actual residual values of the power plant and machinery however, may be different from expected. 
The Group’s subsidiaries considered and determined recoverable values of the power plant and machinery 
based on the valuations derived by the independent professional valuer using the significant assumptions as 
disclosed in Note 2.2.
b) Coal-fired power plant
 Estimating the residual values of the power plant and machinery involves significant judgements, selection 
of variety of methods and assumptions that are normally based on market conditions existing at the balance 
sheet date. The actual residual values of the power plant and machinery however, may be different from 
expected. The Group’s subsidiaries considered and determined the recoverable values of the power plant and 
machinery based on the expected discounted cash flows derived using the significant assumptions as disclosed 
in Note 2.2.
(ii) Intangible assets and investment in associate
 Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units is derived based on value in use of the cash-
generating units. The significant assumptions used to derive value in use are as disclosed in Note 6. 
(iii) Provision for decommissioning costs
 Estimating the provision for decommissioning costs involves significant judgements and assumptions. The actual 
costs, however, may be different from expected. The Group’s subsidiaries considered and determined the provision 
for decommissioning costs based on the valuations derived by the independent professional valuer using the 
significant assumptions as disclosed in Note 21.
(iv) Provision for concession assets
 Estimating the provision for concession assets involves significant judgements, selection of variety of methods 
and assumptions that are normally based on past costs incurred. The actual costs, however, may be different from 
expected. The significant assumptions used to estimate the provision are as disclosed in Note 22.

2.1 Securities
 At 31 December 2024, certain property, plant and equipment of the Group with a total carrying amount of RM8,173,867,000 
(2023: RM8,589,997,000) were charged as securities for debt securities issued by subsidiaries (see Note 19).
2.2 Residual values 
 Estimating the residual values of power plant and machinery involves significant judgements, selection of variety of 
methods and assumptions that are normally based on market conditions existing at the balance sheet date. The actual 
residual values of the power plant and machinery, however, may be different from expected.
 The residual values of power plant and machinery are as below:
Residual values
Power Purchase Agreement (“PPA”) Owner
Year of
 expiry
RM’
million
2024
RM’

2023
Gas-fired power plant
GB3 Sdn. Bhd. 2022 90.0 90.0
Prai Power Sdn. Bhd. 2026 25.0 50.0
Segari Energy Ventures Sdn. Bhd. 2027 170.0 170.0

Tanjung Bin Energy Sdn. Bhd. 2041 1,433.0 1,433.0
3,357.0 3,357.0
 In assessing the appropriateness of the residual values adopted, management considered the recoverable values of the 
power plant and machinery based on the following methods:
a) Valuation by an independent professional valuer for gas-fired power plant
 In the previous financial year, the residual values of the gas-fired power plants were reassessed based on valuation 
reports prepared by an independent professional valuer in December 2023. Based on assessment by the Group, the 
previous residual values remain appropriate except for the residual value of the Prai Power Sdn. Bhd. (“PPSB”) plant 
following an extension of its PPA period. The valuation by the independent professional valuer was derived using the 
following critical assumptions:
1) The plant and machinery will continue in their present use in the business over the economic life of the assets; 
2) Adequate potential profitability of the business, or continuing viability of the operation; and
3) The dismantling and removal of all equipment from the site at the end of the economic life of the assets will 
be the responsibility of the buyer.
Any change to the key assumptions will result in a different residual value recognised.

2.2 Residual values (continued)
b) The discounted cash flow method for coal-fired power plant
 The discounted cash flows were derived using the following critical assumptions:
1) The power plants will be able to operate for another ten (10) years at the end of the concession period, in view 
of:
i) the expected useful life of a coal-fired power plant;
ii) continuous stable demand for power;
iii) cheaper rate as compared to other power alternatives; and
iv) Tenaga Nasional Berhad’s continued reliance on Independent Power Producers.
2) An estimated tariff rate during the extension period which management deems to be reasonable based on the 
expected demand and the tariff rate at the end of the current PPAs;
3) Average despatch factors of 82% to 85% to reflect the future demand for power; and
4) The pre-tax discount rate of 17% per annum. 
 Any change to the key assumptions will result in a different residual value recognised.
2.3 Material accounting policy information
(a) Recognition and measurement
 Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
 Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that 
equipment. 
(b) Depreciation
 Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component 
of an item of property, plant and equipment from the date that they are available for use. Freehold land is not 
depreciated. Property, plant and equipment under construction are not depreciated until the assets are ready for 
their intended use. All spare parts which are expected to be used for more than one period are classified under 
inspection costs within property, plant and equipment. Spare parts will be depreciated from the date that they are 
used. 
 The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
• Buildings 5 – 20 years
• Inspection costs 1.5 – 10 years
• Power plants and machinery 5 – 31 years
• Office equipment and furniture 3 – 10 years
• Motor vehicles 5 – 10 years
• Computers 3 – 5 years

Notes to the Financial Statements
3. Right-of-use assets (continued)
3.1 Extension options
 Some leases of buildings contain extension options exercisable by the Group and the Company up to three years before 
the end of the non-cancellable contract period. Where practicable, the Group and the Company seek to include extension 
options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and 
the Company and not by the lessors. The Group and the Company assess at lease commencement whether they are 
reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group and the Company reassess whether they are reasonably 
certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within their control.
 The extension options of all leases are currently included in the lease terms as the Group and the Company assessed that 
they are reasonably certain to exercise the extension options, which is supported by the high historical rate of extensions 
exercised by the Group and the Company. Hence, there were no potential future lease payments not included in lease 
liabilities.
3.2 Judgements and assumptions in relation to leases
 The Group and the Company assess at lease commencement by applying judgement whether they are reasonably certain 
to exercise the extension options. Group entities consider all facts and circumstances including their past practice and any 
cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken, to help them determine the lease term.
 The Group and the Company also applied judgements and assumptions in determining the incremental borrowing rate 
of the respective leases. Group entities first determine the closest available borrowing rates before using judgement to 
determine the adjustments required to reflect the term, security, value or economic environment of the respective leases.
 
3.3 Securities
 At 31 December 2024, certain right-of-use assets of the Group with a total carrying amount of RM30,434,000 (2023: 
RM34,557,000) were charged as securities for debt securities issued by subsidiaries (see Note 19).
3.4 Material accounting policy information
(a) Recognition and measurement
 All right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.
(b) Lease and non-lease components
 At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group and the Company allocate 
the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component on the basis of their relative stand-
alone prices. However, for leases of properties in which the Group or the Company is a lessee, it has elected not to 
separate non-lease components and will instead account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease 
component.
(c) Recognition exemption
 The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term 
leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group and the Company 
recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term.

 Fair value of investment properties is based on valuations by an independent qualified valuer and derived using the market 
comparison approach. Sales price of comparable properties in close proximity is adjusted for differences in key attributes 
such as property size. The most significant input into this valuation approach is price per square foot of comparable 
properties.
4.4 Material accounting policy information
 Investment properties are measured subsequently at fair value, representing open-market values determined annually by 
independent qualified valuer with any changes therein recognised in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

5. Concession assets (continued)
5.1  Concession assets – Alam Flora Sdn. Bhd. (“AFSB”)
 AFSB, a subsidiary of the Group, entered into a Service Concession Agreement with the Federal Government of Malaysia 
(“Government”) and Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation (“Corporation”) to undertake the Collection 
Services and Public Cleansing Management Services in the state of Pahang, Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and 
Putrajaya for a period of 22 years commencing from 1 September 2011.
 Under the Service Concession Agreement, the Corporation shall pay AFSB monthly payment of agreed fees in consideration 
of AFSB’s obligations. The fees are subject to review on the seventh (7 th) year anniversary and subsequently on the 
fourteenth (14th) year anniversary of the concession. As at the reporting date, there is no change to the prevailing fees as 
negotiations with the Corporation to review the fees are still in progress. 
 Upon expiry of the concession period, AFSB shall hand over all assets purchased or obtained by the Company as required 
by the Corporation in operational conditions specified under the Service Concession Agreement.
5.2 Concession assets – Alam Flora Environmental Solutions Sdn. Bhd. (“AFES”) 
 AFES, a subsidiary of the Group, entered into an agreement with the Government and Corporation to undertake the 
refurbishment, operation and maintenance of incinerators built by the Government in Pulau Pangkor and Cameron 
Highlands for a period of 6 years commencing from 6 April 2017 and 21 September 2017, respectively. Under this 
agreement, the Government shall, through the Corporation pay AFES monthly payment fees based on the total tonnage 
of waste received at the plant. The agreement for the Pulau Pangkor incinerator has been extended in year 2022 for an 
additional three (3) years, expiring on 7 December 2025. Following the expiry of the agreement of Cameron Highlands 
incinerator on 23 July 2023, the Group had written off the Cameron Highlands incinerator in the previous financial year. 
5.3  Material accounting policy information
 Subsequent costs and expenditures relate to infrastructure and equipment costs arising from the commitment to the 
concession contract and are capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of these costs and 
expenditures will flow to the Group. All other repair and maintenance expenses that are routine in nature, are expensed 
and recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.

6. Intangible assets (continued)
 Intangible assets including goodwill arising from interest over Service Concession Agreement
 Initial measurement 
 The Group generates revenue from the integrated solid waste collection and cleansing public management services in the state 
of Pahang, Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya under the Service Concession Agreement (“SCA”) held by AFSB, 
the concession assets holder (see Note 5).
 The fair values of the Intangible Assets arising from the SCA were measured using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method 
(“MEEM”) under the income method. The underlying rationale in the MEEM was that the fair values of Intangible Assets represent 
the present value of the net income after taxes attributable to the Intangible Assets. The net income attributable to the 
Intangible Assets was the excess income after charging a fair return on all the assets that are necessary (contributory assets) 
to realise the net income. The contributory asset charges (“CAC”) were based on the fair value of each contributory asset and 
represent the return on the assets. The assumption in calculating the CAC was that the owner of the Intangible Asset “rents” 
or “leases” the contributory assets from a hypothetical third party in an arm’s length transaction in order to be able to derive 
income from the Intangible Assets. The present value of the expected income attributable to the Intangible Assets less CAC and 
taxes represents the value of the Intangible Assets.
 Management had applied the following key assumptions in deriving the present value of the net income after taxes attributable 
to the Intangible Assets at the acquisition date:
• Remaining useful life of SCA 13.75 years (in accordance with the SCA)
• Revenue Projected tariff rate revisions with an annualised growth rate of 2%
• Cost of sales Projected private contractor costs based on past experience 
•  Capital expenditures (“CAPEX”) Expenses on concession assets replacement costs for existing SCA business
•  Pre-tax discount rate 18.65%
 In applying the MEEM valuation methodology, the expected cash flows were discounted to their present value equivalent using 
a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as the time value of money. This was calculated by 
weighing the required returns on debt and equity in proportion to their assumed percentages. 
 Impairment testing for cash-generating unit containing goodwill
 Goodwill was allocated to AFSB following the completion of the acquisition of AFSB by the Group. The goodwill represents the 
cash-generating unit (“CGU”) within the Group at which the goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes. The 
CGU relates to collection and cleansing management services. The Group has exercised significant judgement in assessing the 
CGU’s recoverable amount using value in use.
 The impairment test of the above CGU was based on its value in use, determined by discounting future cash flows to their 
present values equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as the time value of 
money. This is calculated by weighing the required returns on debt and equity in proportion to its assumed percentages. The 
discount rate reflected the current market assessment of the time value of money and was based on the estimated cost of 
capital.

 Intangible assets including goodwill arising from interest over Service Concession Agreement (continued)
 Impairment testing for cash-generating unit containing goodwill (continued)
 The following table shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of value in use, as well as the significant 
assumptions used in the valuation model.
• Remaining useful life of SCA 8.75 years (in accordance with the SCA)
• Revenue Projected tariff rate revisions with an annualised growth rate of 2%
• Cost of sales Projected private contractor costs based on past experience 
•  CAPEX Expenses on concession assets replacement costs for existing SCA business
•  Pre-tax discount rate 18%
 The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the solid waste management 
industry and were based on external sources and internal sources (historical data). 
 Consequent to the assessment, the carrying amount of the CGU of RM303,643,000 exceeded the estimated recoverable 
amount of RM293,450,000, hence the Group recognised an impairment loss on goodwill amounting to RM10,193,000 in the 
profit or loss. Adverse changes in any of the key assumptions may result in further impairment losses to be recognised.
 Intangible assets arising from interest over Power Purchase (subsidiaries and associate), Power and Water Purchase 
(associate and joint venture), Water Purchase (joint venture) and Operation and Maintenance (subsidiaries) Agreements 
 The Group’s revenue is substantially derived from the generation and sale of electricity energy and generating capacity in 
Malaysia, which is governed by the Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) (together with the Independent Power Producer 
Licences (“IPP Licences”) issued by the Ministry of Energy, Water and Communications), Power and Water Purchase Agreements 
(“PWPAs”) and Water Purchase Agreement (“WPA”) held by the subsidiaries, associate and joint venture. The Operation and 
Maintenance Agreements (“OMAs”) held by certain subsidiaries engaged in operation and maintenance are associated with the 
Independent Power Producers within the Group.
 Upon acquisition of the subsidiaries, associates and joint venture, the Group has determined the expected cash flows to be 
generated from the PPAs, OMAs (together with the IPP Licences), PWPAs and WPA. 
 The PPAs and OMAs held by subsidiaries in Malaysia are recognised as a single asset in accordance with MFRS 138, Intangible 
Assets, in view that they are required for the generation, operation and maintenance, sale of electricity energy and generating 
capacity in Malaysia.
 As at 31 December 2024, there are three (3) PPAs (together with the respective IPP Licences) held by the Group’s power 
producing subsidiaries, namely Segari Energy Ventures Sdn. Bhd. (“SEV”), Tanjung Bin Power Sdn. Bhd. (“TBP”) and an associate, 
Kapar Energy Ventures Sdn. Bhd. (“KEV”) as well as three (3) OMAs held by the Group’s operation and maintenance subsidiaries, 
namely Malakoff Power Berhad (“MPB”) and Tanjung Bin O&M Berhad (“TBOM”). 
 The PWPAs and WPA held by associate and joint venture are recognised as part of the carrying amount in the investments in 
associates and joint venture.
 As at 31 December 2024, Hidd Power Company B.S.C. (c) (“HPC”), an associate holds one (1) PWPA and Saudi-Malaysia Water 
& Electricity Company Limited (“SAMAWEC”), an indirect joint venture holds one (1) PWPA and one (1) WPA.

 Intangible assets arising from interest over Power Purchase (subsidiaries and associate), Power and Water Purchase 
(associate and joint venture), Water Purchase (joint venture) and Operation and Maintenance (subsidiaries) Agreements 
(continued) 
 The PPAs, PWPAs, WPA and OMAs are the key documents that govern the underlying strength of the Group’s cash flows, 
which provide for, inter alia, the electricity tariff, supply, operations and maintenance and all other terms to be met by the 
subsidiaries, associates and joint venture. 
 Intangible assets arising from interest over Power Purchase (subsidiaries and associate), Power and Water Purchase 
(associate) and Operation and Maintenance (subsidiaries) Agreements

 The fair values of the Intangible Assets arising from the PPAs, PWPA, and OMAs were measured using the Multi-Period Excess 
Earnings Method (“MEEM”) under the income method. The underlying rationale in the MEEM was that the fair values of 
Intangible Assets represent the present value of the net income after taxes attributable to the Intangible Assets. The net income

to be able to derive income from the Intangible Assets. The present value of the expected income attributable to the Intangible 
Assets less CAC and taxes represents the value of the Intangible Assets.
 Management had applied the following key assumptions in deriving the present value of the net income after taxes attributable 
to the Intangible Assets at the acquisition date:
• Remaining useful life of PPAs/PWPA/OMAs 2 – 25 years (in accordance with the respective PPAs, PWPA and OMAs)
• Dependable Capacity (“DC”): 
 - Power  350 MW – 2,420 MW
 - Water 17,047 m³/hour
• Capacity Factor: 
 - Power  10% – 75% of DC
 - Water 91% – 99% of DC
• Net Output: 
 - Electrical (million kW/hour) 213 – 11,197
 - Water (thousand m³) 67,370 – 73,771
• Capacity Rate: 
 - Power (RM/kW/month) 11.35 – 50.00
 - Water (RM/m³/month) 1,222 – 1,339
• Fixed Operating Rate under Revenue  
(RM/kW/month) 4.00 – 10.50
• Variable Operating Rate under Revenue:  
 - Power (RM/kW/month)  0.013 – 4.775
 - Water (RM/m³/month) 58.20 – 116.40
• Fuel price (RM/mmBtu) 4.60 – 13.70
• CAC 17.77% – 28.00% of revenue
 In applying the MEEM valuation methodology, the expected cash flows were discounted to their present value equivalent using 
a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as the time value of money. This was calculated by 
weighing the required returns on debt and equity in proportion to their assumed percentages. The applied pre-tax discount rate 
ranges from 7.5% to 9% per annum.

 Intangible assets arising from interest over Power and Water Purchase and Water Purchase Agreements (joint venture)
 Initial measurement
 The Group’s revenue is also derived from the generation and sale of desalinated water and electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, which is governed by the PWPA and WPA. 
 The fair values of the Intangible Assets arising from the PWPA and WPA were measured using the MEEM under the income 
method. The underlying rationale in the MEEM was that the fair values of Intangible Assets represent the present value of the 
net income after taxes attributable to the Intangible Assets. The net income attributable to the Intangible Assets was the excess 
income after charging a fair return on all the assets that are necessary (contributory assets) to realise the net income. The CAC

an arm’s length transaction in order to be able to derive income from the Intangible Assets. The present value of the expected 
income attributable to the Intangible Assets less CAC and taxes represents the value of the Intangible Assets.
 Management had applied the following key assumptions in deriving the present value of the net income after taxes attributable 
to the Intangible Assets at the acquisition date:
• Contracted tariff Agreed tariff as per PWPA and WPA
• Residual value 10% of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Cost (“EPCC”) net of 
  decommissioning costs as the terminal value
•  CAPEX Expenses on power plants and machinery replacement 
 In applying the MEEM valuation methodology, the expected cash flows were discounted to their present value equivalent using 
a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as the time value of money. This was calculated by 
weighing the required returns on debt and equity in proportion to their assumed percentages. The applied pre-tax discount rate 
was 44% per annum.
 
 Interest over Power Purchase and Operation and Maintenance Agreements (subsidiaries)
 Interest over Power Purchase and Operation and Maintenance Agreements of subsidiaries have finite useful lives and are 
subject to impairment assessment only if there is an indication of impairment. There is no indication of impairment during the

 Interest over Power and Water Purchase Agreement in HPC (associate)
 Impairment testing for cash-generating unit containing goodwill and interest over Power and Water Purchase Agreement 
in HPC (associate)
 Goodwill was allocated to HPC following the completion of the acquisition of HPC by the Group. The goodwill represented the 
CGU within the Group at which the goodwill was monitored for internal management purposes. The CGU also included interest 
over PWPA in HPC. During the financial year, in the view that HPC’s PWPA is approaching expiry in year 2027 with no extension 
period expected based on latest assessment performed by the Group, an impairment assessment was carried out on the 
recoverable amount of its investment in HPC using value in use.
 The impairment test of the above CGU was based on value in use, determined by discounting future cash flows to their present 
values equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as the time value of money. This 
was calculated by weighing the required returns on debt and equity in proportion to its assumed percentages. The discount rate 
reflected the current market assessment of the time value of money and was based on the estimated cost of capital.
 The following table shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of value in use, as well as the significant 
assumptions used in the valuation model.
• Remaining useful life of PWPA 2.75 years (in accordance with remaining tenure of original PWPA)
• Plant availability Plant availability projected based on past experience
• Power and water despatch Power and water despatch projected based on past experience
•  Pre-tax discount rate 11.50%
 The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the power and water 
desalination industry and were based on external sources and internal sources (historical data).
 Consequent to the assessment, the carrying amount of the CGU of RM340,021,000 exceeded the estimated recoverable 
amount of RM302,494,000, hence the Group recognised an impairment loss amounting to RM37,527,000 in profit or loss (see 
Note 8). Adverse changes in any of the key assumptions may result in further impairment losses to be recognised.
 Interest over Power and Water Purchase Agreement and Water Purchase Agreement in SAMAWEC (joint venture)

of the amount is solely at the discretion of the subsidiaries. These contributions are accounted for as the Company’s net 
shareholders’ investments in its subsidiaries and are stated at cost.
7.3 During the financial year, the Company continued to assess the recoverability of its investments in subsidiaries which have 
10 years or less in the remaining tenure of their PPAs based on fair value less costs of disposal estimated using the market 
approach. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on inputs in the valuation techniques 
used.
 Consequent to the impairment tests carried out, the total carrying amount of certain investments in subsidiaries of 
RM6,561,000,000 (2023: RM7,215,000,000) exceeded the recoverable amount of RM6,423,895,000 (2023:

Notes to the Financial Statements
8. Investments in associates (continued)
8.1 Capital contribution to an associate is considered as a long-term source of capital to the associate, in which any repayment 
of the amount is solely at the discretion of the associate. These contributions are accounted for as the Group and the 
Company’s net shareholders’ investments in its associate and are stated at cost less impairment loss, if any.
8.2 During the financial year, the Group recognised an impairment loss on its investment in HPC of RM37,527,000 (2023: 
RM96,065,000) in profit or loss (see Note 6). 
8.3 During the financial year, the Group recorded a reversal of impairment loss on its investment in KEV of RM25,043,000 
(2023: RM162,403,000). The Group had in previous years recorded an impairment in KEV and carried the investment 
at RM215,353,000. Based on further assessment during the current financial year, the recoverable amount based on 
its value in use remained at RM215,353,000. Hence, the share of losses amounting to RM25,043,000 arising from the 
investment in KEV resulted in a corresponding reversal of impairment loss.
8.4 Material accounting policy information
 Investments in associates are measured in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any impairment

12.2 Global minimum top-up tax
 As at 31 December 2023, the government of Malaysia (“MY”) has enacted new legislation to implement the global minimum 
top-up tax. The Group does not expect to be subjected to any material top-up tax in relation to its foreign operations. 
However, since the newly enacted tax legislation in MY will only come into effect in year 2025, there is no current tax 
impact for the year ended 31 December 2024.
 The Group is currently performing a detailed assessment of the financial impact that may arise from the implementation 
of the global minimum top-up tax.

12.3  Temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting
 The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and 
accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.
12.4  Material accounting policy information
 Where investment properties are carried at their fair value, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured using 
the tax rates that would apply on sale of those assets at their carrying values at the reporting date unless the property is 
depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the property 
over time, rather than through sale. In all other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the 
expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

sukuk at the end of the seventh year from date of issuance and thereafter on each subsequent periodic distribution date;

18. Perpetual sukuk (continued)
 Details of the Sukuk Wakalah are as follows (continued):
c) The subsidiary has the right to defer the payment of the periodic distribution amount by giving the required deferral 
notice. Deferred periodic distribution, if any, will be cumulative but will not earn additional profits thus, there will be no 
compounding effect; and

Based on the underlying issuing terms, the perpetual sukuk has been classified as equity in the financial statements.
18.1 Material accounting policy information
 Perpetual sukuk is classified as equity as there is no contractual obligation to redeem the instrument. The perpetual sukuk 
is redeemable only at the option of the Company’s subsidiary. Profit distribution on perpetual sukuk is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity in the period in which it is declared.

 Provision for decommissioning costs is the estimated costs that the Group will have to incur in removing or dismantling the 
power plants at the end of their respective PPA terms. The present value is derived by discounting the decommissioning costs 
over the remaining useful lives of the power plants based on the appropriate discount rates.

21. Provision for decommissioning costs (continued)
21.1  Coal-fired power plants
 The provision for decommissioning costs for the coal-fired power plants was based on valuation reports prepared by an 
independent professional valuer in previous years. The decommissioning costs of coal-fired power plants estimated were 
derived using the following significant assumptions:
• All storage tanks will be emptied by the most economical means prior to the commencement of the decommissioning;
• All building contents, plant and equipment will be removed; and
• Pre-tax discount rates of 5.12% to 5.71% per annum. 
 During the current financial year, the Group has assessed and determined that the provision for decommissioning costs 
for coal-fired power plants remains appropriate.
21.2  Gas-fired power plants
 The provision for decommissioning costs for the gas-fired power plants was based on valuation reports prepared by an 
independent professional valuer in previous years. The decommissioning costs of gas-fired power plants estimated were 
derived using the following significant assumptions:
• All building contents, plant and equipment will be removed;
• All buildings and structures will be removed, including pile caps. Piles will be left on site; and
• Pre-tax discount rate of 3.87% per annum. 
 During the current financial year, the Group has assessed and determined that the provision for decommissioning costs 
for gas-fired power plants remains appropriate.
21.3 Material accounting policy information
 
 Provision for decommissioning costs which arises principally in connection with the power plants is measured by 
independent professional valuers, whereby the present value is calculated using amounts discounted over the existing 
PPAs. The liability is recognised (together with a corresponding amount as part of the power plants) once an obligation 
crystallises in the period when a reasonable estimate can be made. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as part 
of “finance costs”.

 The Group has contractual obligations to maintain the assets required to provide collection services and public cleansing 
services to a specified standard under the Service Concession Agreement (see Note 5). The provision has been made based on 
expected replacement costs at appropriate intervals, and was derived using the following significant assumptions:
• Equipment is due for replacement every 4 years;
• Bins and vehicles are due for replacement every 9 years;
• The model of certain vehicles will be standardised during the replacement; and
• Pre-tax discount rate of 4.60% per annum.
22.1 Material accounting policy information
 A provision is recognised based on the contractual obligations that the Group must fulfill as a condition of the Group’s 
licence to maintain the infrastructure to a specified standard and to restore the infrastructure which has deteriorated 
below specific conditions as stated under Service Concession Agreement. The liability is recognised once an obligation 
crystallises in the period when a reasonable estimate can be made. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as part 
of “cost of sales”.

34.3 Financial risk management
 The Group has exposure to the following risks from its financial instruments:
• Credit risk
• Liquidity risk
• Market risk
34.4 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from the individual characteristics of each customer. The 
Company’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from advances to subsidiaries and financial guarantees given to banks 
for credit facilities granted to subsidiaries. There are no significant changes as compared to prior periods.
 Trade receivables
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through the 
review of the receivables ageing. Credit evaluations are performed on significant customers requiring credit over a certain 
amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.

34.4 Credit risk (continued)
 Trade receivables (continued)
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk (continued)
 At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether any of the trade receivables are credit impaired. 
 The gross carrying amounts of credit impaired trade receivables are written off (either partially or full) when there is 
no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. 
Nevertheless, trade receivables that are written off could still be subject to the enforcement activities.
 There are no significant changes as compared to previous year.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables is represented 
by the carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.
 Concentration of credit risk
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group has a concentration of credit risk in the form of trade debts due from Tenaga 
Nasional Berhad and Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation, representing approximately 89% (2023: 
87%) of the total receivables of the Group. 
 The exposure of credit risk for trade receivables as at the end of the current and previous reporting periods by geographic 
region was solely domestic.
 Recognition and measurement of impairment losses
 In managing credit risk of trade receivables, the Group manages its debtors and takes appropriate actions (including but 
not limited to legal actions) to recover long overdue balances. Generally, trade receivables will pay within 30 days. The 
Group’s debt recovery process is as follows:
a) Above 30 days past due after credit term, the Group will start to initiate a structured debt recovery process which is 
monitored by the commercial team; and
b) Above 90 days past due, the Group will initiate a legal proceeding against the customer.
 The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure Expected Credit Losses (“ECLs”) of trade receivables. 
 Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past three years. The Group also considers differences 
between (a) economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, (b) current conditions 
and (c) the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. Nevertheless, the Group 
believes that these factors are not significant for the purpose of impairment calculation for the year.

 The allowance account in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses. Unless the Group is satisfied 
that recovery of the amount is probable, the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against the receivables. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and deposits with licensed banks and other licensed corporations
 The cash and cash equivalents and deposits are held with banks and financial institutions. As at the end of the reporting 
period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial 
position.
 These banks and financial institutions have low credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by 
government agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material.
 Other receivables
 Credit risk on other receivables are mainly arising from interest receivables, deposits paid for office buildings and fixtures 
rented. These deposits will be received at the end of each lease term. The Group manages the credit risk together with 
the leasing arrangement.
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the 
statements of financial position.

 Financial guarantees
 Financial guarantees issued are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at higher of:
• the amount of the loss allowance; and
• the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance 
to the principles of MFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain 
subsidiaries. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries to service their loans on an individual basis.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 The maximum exposure to credit risk amounts to RM1,459,302,000 (2023: RM1,841,409,000) representing the 
outstanding banking facilities of the subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period.
 The financial guarantees are provided as credit enhancements to the subsidiaries’ secured loans.

 Financial guarantees (continued)
 Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
 The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary’s financial position deteriorates 
significantly. The Company considers a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when:
• The subsidiary is unlikely to repay its credit obligation to the bank in full; or
• The subsidiary is continuously loss making and is having a deficit shareholders’ fund. 
 The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually using internal information 
available. 
 As at the end of the reporting period, there was no indication that any subsidiary would default on repayment.
 The financial guarantees have not been recognised since the fair value on initial recognition was not material.
 
 Related company loans and advances
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group and the Company provide loans and advances to related companies, which include subsidiaries, associates, 
related parties, joint ventures and related companies. The Group and the Company monitor the results of the related 
companies regularly, as well as their ability to repay the loans and advances on an individual basis.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the 
statements of financial position. 
 Related company loans and advances provided are not secured by any collateral or supported by any other credit 
enhancements. 
 
 Recognition and measurement of impairment loss 
 Generally, the Group and the Company consider related company loans and advances to have low credit risk. It is assumed 
that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a related company’s financial position deteriorates significantly. As 
the Group and the Company are able to determine the timing of payments of the related company’s loans and advances 
when they are payable, loans and advances are considered to be in default when the related companies are not able to 
pay when demanded. A related company’s loans and advances are considered to be credit impaired when:
a) the related company is unlikely to repay its loans or advances to the Company in full;
b) the related company’s loans and advances are overdue for more than 365 days; or
c) the related company is continuously loss making and has a deficit in shareholders’ fund.

34.5 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings.
 The Group maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by management to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.
 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis in relation to the Group’s and the Company’s 
financial liabilities could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.

34.6 Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other prices that 
will affect the Group’s financial position or cash flows.
 Currency risk
 The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, cash and cash equivalents and borrowings that are 
denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The currencies giving rise to 
this risk are Indonesian Rupiah (“IDR”), US Dollar (“USD”) and Australian Dollar (“AUD”). 
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group hedges certain of its foreign currency denominated loans and borrowings. The Group uses cross currency

one year after the end of the reporting period.

 Currency risk sensitivity analysis 
 Foreign currency risk arises from Group entities which have functional currencies other than Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”). A 
10% (2023: 10%) strengthening of the RM against the following currencies would have increased/(decreased) post-tax 
profit by the amounts shown below. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group 
considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in 
particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

 A 10% (2023: 10%) weakening of RM against the above currencies at the end of the reporting period would have had equal 
but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remained 
constant.
 Interest rate risk
 The Group’s fixed rate deposits and borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in 
interest rates. The Group’s variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in 
interest rates. Short-term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 In managing interest rate risk, the Group maintains a balanced portfolio consisting mainly fixed rated instruments. All 
interest rate exposures are monitored and managed proactively by the Group’s management. The Group has also entered 
into interest rate swap and cross currency interest rate swaps in order to hedge against the floating rate exposure. At 31 
December 2024, the cross currency interest rate swaps mature over the next year, matching the maturity of the floating 
rate bank loans.

 Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis
 Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
 The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
and the Group does not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. The 
Company also does not account for any fixed rate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
 At the reporting date, if the fixed rate financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss have been 1% (2023: 
1%) higher/lower, with all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit or loss would have increased/(decreased) by 
RM1,119,000 (2023: RM1,753,000) arising as a result of changes in the fair value of the financial assets classified as fair 
value through profit or loss.

34.7 Hedging activities
 Currency risk – Transactions in foreign currency
 The Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies 
in which sales, purchases, receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of the 
Group. The functional currency of Group companies is primarily the Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”). The currency in which these 
transactions are primarily denominated is the US Dollar (“USD”).
 The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based 
on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated 
in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged 
item using the hypothetical derivative method.
 In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
• the effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected 
in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; and
• changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.
 Interest rate risk
 To manage interest rate risk exposure, the Group partly enters into fixed-rate instruments and partly borrows at a floating 
rate and uses interest rate swaps as hedges of the variability in cash flows attributable to movements in interest rates. 
 The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based 
on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts.
 The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be effective in offsetting 
changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.
 In these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:
• the effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected 
in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in interest rates; and
• differences in repricing dates between the swaps and the borrowings.
 Cash flow hedge
 The Group applied the requirements of MFRS 9, Financial Instruments for hedge accounting. The Group has elected to 
account for the entire swap as a hedging instrument in its entirety. The forward element of these swaps is not separately 
accounted for from its spot element. Accordingly, the change in fair value of the entire swap is recognised in the hedging 
reserve in equity.
 The Group entered into various interest rate swap (“IRS”) and cross currency interest rate swaps (“CCIRS”) to hedge the 
interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk in relation to the variability in cash flows on the floating rate RM and USD loans.

 Level 2 fair value
 Derivatives
 The CCIRS instruments entered by a subsidiary in Malaysia are not actively traded therefore market-based prices are not 
readily available. The fair values of the instruments are calculated based on the present value of future principal and 
interest cash flows. The spot rates, forward rates and foreign exchange rates used to calculate present value are directly 
observable from the market.
 Other investments
 Fair value of other investments is determined by reference to statements provided by the respective financial institutions, 
with which the placements were entered into.
 Non-derivative financial liabilities
 Fair value of the long-term borrowings which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present 
value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting 
period.
 Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair values 
 There has been no transfer between Level 1 and 2 fair values during the financial year (2023: no transfer in either 
directions).
 Level 3 fair value
 Level 3 fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs for the financial assets and liabilities. 
 The following table shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values within Level 3, as the key

 On 24 September 2018, Allianz General Insurance Company (Malaysia) Berhad initiated the arbitration as a subrogated action, 
in the name of PPSB, against GE Entities, in relation to an incident on or about 18 July 2015 (“2015 Incident”) which resulted 
in damage to a gas turbine at PPSB’s 350MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine Power Plant situated in Prai, Penang (“Prai Power 
Plant”).
 PPSB alleged that GE Entities breached the duty to exercise reasonable care and skill to properly design, manufacture, supply 
and install a GE 109FA single shaft gas turbine at the Prai Power Plant. By reason of the alleged breach, PPSB claims for, among 
others, loss and damages in the sum of RM72,094,050 from GE Entities.
 In addition to filing their Defence on 22 April 2019, GE Entities filed a Counterclaim against PPSB alleging breach of:
a) the Settlement and Release Agreement dated 12 December 2012 (“SRA”) in relation to two incidents at the Prai Power

 In prior year, on 7 September 2023, Tuah Utama Sdn. Bhd. (“TUSB”) and Malakoff Technical Solutions Sdn. Bhd. (“MTSSB”), 
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company had completed the acquisitions of 70% equity interests in RP Hydro (Kelantan) 
Sdn. Bhd. (“RPHK”) and Rising O&M Engineering Services Sdn. Bhd. (“ROMES”) for a total cash consideration of RM35.0 million 
and RM0.7 million, respectively. In the 4 months to 31 December 2023, the subsidiaries contributed loss of RM158,000 with 
no revenue derived. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management estimates the consolidated loss for the

adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Members of Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Registration No. 200601011818 (731568-V)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements  
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Malakoff Corporation Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as 
at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, 
statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes 
to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 271 to 390. 
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the 
Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance 
with MFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (“MFRS Accounting Standards”), IFRS 
Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS Accounting Standards”) and the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) 
of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

Independent Auditors’ Report
To the Members of Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Registration No. 200601011818 (731568-V)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. The matters were  addressed in the context of our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters.
Group
Valuation of goodwill of Alam Flora Sdn. Bhd.
Refer to Note 6 – Intangible assets
The key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit
The Group has goodwill amounting to RM153 million arising from 
the acquisition of Alam Flora Sdn. Bhd. (“AFSB”) in 2019. During 
the year, the Group has performed an impairment assessment 
and recognised an impairment loss of RM10.2 million in profit or 
loss.
We focused on goodwill arising from the acquisition of AFSB 
as the carrying amount is material and the impairment test is 
sensitive to a possible change in assumptions.
There are significant judgements involved in forecasting and 
discounting of future cash flows, which is the basis of assessment 
of impairment over goodwill.
We performed the following audit procedures, among others:
• We evaluated the Group’s cash flow projections and the 
process by which they were developed. We compared the 
projections to business plans approved by the Board of 
Directors and also compared previous projections to actual 
results to assess the performance of the business and the 
accuracy of the forecasting;
• We obtained confirmation that the key assumptions were 
subject to oversight from the Directors;
• We evaluated and challenged the following key assumptions 
used in the cash flows projections:
- Revenue – we assessed the reasonableness of the estimated 
revenue in the projections based on past actual revenue 
recorded and read the clauses in the service concession 
agreement governing tariff rate revisions;
- Cost of sales – we assessed the reasonableness of private 
contractor costs used in the projections based on past 
actual costs incurred and incorporating inflationary factors; 
- Capital expenditures (“CAPEX”) – we compared CAPEX 
assumptions in the cash flows to the budget approved by 
the Directors; and 
- Discount rate – our own valuation specialist compared 
the discount rate used against other industry players and 
external sources.
• We assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the 
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reflected the risks inherent in the 
valuation of goodwill.
We have determined that there are no key audit matters in the audit of the separate financial statements of the Company to 
communicate in our auditors’ report.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in 
the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.

To the Members of Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Registration No. 200601011818 (731568-V)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon (continued)
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the annual report and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the annual 
report and, in doing so, consider whether the annual report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the annual report, we are required to report that fact. We 
have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with MFRS Accounting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the 
Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the 
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, 
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved 
standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Group and of 
the Company. 
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Directors.

To the Members of Malakoff Corporation Berhad (Registration No. 200601011818 (731568-V)) (Incorporated in Malaysia)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of 
the Group or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities 
or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible 
for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible 
for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and 
where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our auditors’ report because the adverse consequences 
of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not 
acted as auditors are disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements.
Other Matter
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in 
Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.
