Eco World Development Group Berhad (“EcoWorld 
Malaysia”, “ EcoWorld” or “the Group”) welcomes  
you to a pivotal chapter in our journey – the Integrated  
Annual Report 2023 (“IAR 2023”). More than a  
compilation of data and statistics, this report is a 
testament to our dedication to integrated reporting 
principles, offering a panoramic view of our performance 
and strides in value creation for stakeholders over the 
short-, medium-, and long- term.
Over the past year, our commitment to transparency and 
sustainability	has	driven	significant	progress	as	we	uphold	
the	five	pillars	of	People,	Planet,	Partnership,	Prosperity	
and Peace across our <IR> journey. The culmination of 
this effort is embodied in the IAR 2023, representing  
our full embrace of the <IR> principles-based framework. 
As we navigate the intricate landscape of sustained  
value creation, an integrated mindset becomes our 
guiding compass, connecting our performance with our 
vision of Creating Tomorrow & Beyond.

MATERIALITY
In FY2023, we reviewed our material sustainability 
matters to ensure alignment with Bursa Malaysia 
Securities Berhad’s latest Main Market Listing 
Requirements (“MMLR”) and Global Reporting Initiatives 
(“GRI”) Standards. We maintained the materiality 
matrix generated in the preceding year due to its 
continued relevance to our operations and stakeholders.  
Our	material	matters	reflect	our	current	and	potential	
risks and opportunities which have an impact on the  
value created for our stakeholders. The strategic  
approach to managing these material matters is 
addressed in this report consistent with our Sustainability 
Report 2023 (“sR 2023”). The Board validates and 
endorses these material matters. For more information

EcoWorld’s DnA 
EcoWorld’s DNA is a distinguishing aspect of the Group’s strategy. Our approach weaves together Design,  
Nature and Art into the very fabric of the sustainable developments that we create. Going beyond conventional  
concepts and construction, our developments integrate ESG elements thoughtfully and holistically, thereby  
contributing to the development of highly liveable low carbon cities.

Design – Innovative and Contemporary Living Concepts
Sustainability is incorporated from the conceptualisation stage of our projects.  
We integrate innovative design concepts with the needs of our customers into our project 
masterplans.
Green Infrastructure Design - Our projects prioritise green designs for environmental 
efficiency	while	meeting	customer	needs	with	innovative	concepts.
Emphasising placemaking – We foster vibrant communities where residents thrive  
and connect by integrating sustainable placemaking across our developments.
nature – Greening our Townships
Our townships stand out in terms of their sustainability, particularly in their preservation  
of	flora	and	fauna.	Characterised	by	attractive	greenery	and	scenic	landscapes,	they	are	
crafted to create a balance between the ecosystem and community.
nature Integration - We actively transplant mature trees in our developments, creating  
habitats for local wildlife, improving air quality and enhancing soil stability.
nurturing Biodiversity - Our parks and waterways attract various animal species through  
thoughtful plant selection.
sustainable Landscaping – We embrace sustainability by incorporating resilient native  
plants, minimising the need for frequent replacements and utilising water from detention 
ponds	and	bio	effluents	to	nurture	our	landscapes,	fostering	environmentally	conscious	
and sustainable ecosystems.
Community Building and Recreational opportunities - We foster community  
involvement through recreational opportunities and ecoconscious initiatives like  
conducting recycling campaigns, setting up recycling bins and encouraging  
environmental conservation.
Art – Embedding Aesthetic Architecture
Artistic considerations permeate every aspect of our designs, resulting in distinctive and 
appealing buildings and townships tailored to each era or theme.
Thematic Designs - Each of our developments has a distinct architectural style, with its 
own ambiance and aesthetic quality: from Straits Colonial, Victorian to Classical European 
and Modern Tropical.

EcoWorld has conducted a comprehensive assessment to identify climate-related 
risks and opportunities within our value chain. These evaluations span short-, 
medium- and long-term horizons and are categorised as transitional and  
physical risks.
We conducted a qualitative scenario analysis to evaluate the potential  
climate-related	impacts	on	EcoWorld’s	operations	and	financial	performance.	 
Two scenarios were considered, namely the ‘Paris Agreement’ (warming below 2°C) 
and ‘Worst-Case Scenario’ (4-5°C warming) in terms of global temperature rise  
by 2100.

10-YEAR GRoUp pERFoRMAnCE
Much has changed since we started in 2013. The world 
is not only evolving but transforming at a very rapid 
pace, especially with new technology. There have been 
prolonged periods of sectoral weakness, economic 
uncertainties and turbulence caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic. These challenges were further compounded 
by supply chain disruptions and cost escalations.
Accordingly,	 throughout	 this	 first	 decade	 we	 have	
had to strategise, adapt and reinvent how we should  
operate in a fast-changing landscape. With every  
challenge we asked ourselves - how can we do better 
as a developer? We pushed ourselves to become 
more creative. We were quick to embrace new ways of  
doing things and discover new ways of selling and 
marketing. We came up with new designs and created 
spaces that people want to live and do business in.
As a result, EcoWorld Malaysia achieved total  
cumulative sales of RM31.9 billion, averaging close 
to RM3.2 billion sales per annum, which not only met  
but consistently exceeded our annual sales targets.
The	Group’s	Profit	After	Tax	(“pAT”) from our Malaysian 
Operations grew tremendously, totalling RM1.5 billion 
in	 our	 first	 decade.	 Initial	 profits,	 which	 averaged	 
RM54	 million	 per	 annum	 in	 FY2014-2016,	 increased	 
to	 an	 average	 of	 RM260	 million	 per	 annum	 by	 
FY2021-2023. In FY2023 we achieved a record high  
PAT of RM285 million from Malaysian Operations.

Our results to-date is testament to the Group’s strategic 
decision to transform and evolve from our roots as a 
township developer.
Today, EcoWorld Malaysia is a multi-faceted real estate 
player with a diverse range of products and services 
across four revenue pillars to serve the residential (both 
landed and high-rise), commercial and industrial markets.
•	Eco Townships offer beautifully designed landed 
homes amidst lush greeneries and comprehensive 
lifestyle amenities in keeping with the Group’s mission 
of creating World-class Eco-living for our homeowners, 
residents and visitors alike.
 Projects include:
 Eco Majestic, Eco Forest, Eco Sanctuary,  
Eco Ardence and Eco Grandeur in the Klang 
Valley
 Eco Botanic, Eco Botanic 2, Eco Summer,  
Eco Spring and Eco Tropics in Iskandar Malaysia;  
and
  Eco Meadows, Eco Horizon and Eco Sun 
(upcoming) in Penang.
•	Eco Rise covers a growing range of high-rise residential 
developments within BBCC, Eco Sky, Eco Terraces,  
Eco Nest and Parque Residences, as well as our popular 
and affordable duduk apartments;
•	Eco Hubs	 comprise	shop	and	strata	offices,	as	well	
as retail spaces located within our townships and 
integrated developments across all 3 regions; and 
•		Eco Business Parks consist of EBP I, II, III (ongoing) and 
VI (upcoming) in Iskandar Malaysia, and EBP V in the 
Klang Valley, which are developed to serve the needs 
of 21st century industrialists, both local or international.
The increasing size and strength of each revenue pillar 
have	given	EcoWorld	Malaysia	the	flexibility	and	agility	
to adapt and adjust annual product launches to serve  
the market segment experiencing the most robust 
demand. This contributed in no small measure to the 
Group’s remarkable track record of achieving average 
annual	 sales	 in	 excess	 of	 RM3.6	 billion,	 whilst	 also	
increasing	 gross	 profit	 margins	 from	 pre-pandemic	 
levels of 19.1% in FY2019 to 24.2% in FY2023.

EcoWorld Malaysia is a brick-and-mortar company. 
However, in today’s world, there is great emphasis on 
technology. To drive productivity, as a group,  we initiated 
our digital transformation back in 2017, beginning  
with our frontline and marketing support functions.  
These efforts had a direct positive impact on sales,  
with improved lead generation and faster sales  
conversion. Digitalisation also resulted in substantial 
cost savings that have driven down both marketing and 
administrative expenses.
Today, continual digital transformation is an integral 
part of the Group’s modus operandi which has 
extended	beyond	office	and	backroom	functions	to	also	
cover site inspection and documentation processes.  
Apart from productivity gains, the successful integration 
of our e-Inspection & Test Plan (“eITp”) initiative across 
all	projects	 has	 improved	 site	 efficiency,	 reduced

VALUE
When	 we	 first	 started	 EcoWorld,	 many	 people	 said	 
“What’s so eco about you? What’s so eco about 
EcoWorld?” That was well before ESG became a  
trending issue.
As such, way back in 2014, we started a blueprint to 
define	what	ESG	meant	to	us.	We	started	a	Green	Council	
that is now a key driver of our sustainability initiatives 
groupwide. We asked ourselves, “What is the DNA of 
EcoWorld?” “What is our Core Value?” For us, the most 
important thing is how can we touch somebody’s life? 
How can we change their lives for the better? How do we 
transform their way of living? How do we bring hope to 
our community and to the less fortunate in our society?
Over the years, guided by these questions, we have 
continued	to	refine	and	redefine	how	we	can	operate	
responsibly and sustainably, in a manner that balances out 
our commitment to positively impact every stakeholder 
group whilst delivering good returns to our shareholders.

As we grew and matured as an organisation, led by our 
Sustainability Committee, we formalised many of our 
ESG processes and formulated policies to communicate 
our aspirations and commitments. Our sustainability 
reporting has also been elevated through adherence 
to the TCFD. Through TCFD, we are fostering a culture 
of accountability, ensuring that our stakeholders are 
informed about our climate-related initiatives and the 
measures we are taking to mitigate risks.
This year, the Sustainability Committee developed 
a	 roadmap	 for	 the	 Group	 to	 achieve	 Net	 Zero	 GHG	
emissions by 2050, in line with Malaysia’s commitment 
and our Climate Change Policy approved by our Board 
of Directors. The proactive measures we are taking to 
achieve a low-carbon future include the progressive 
solarisation of our sales galleries, establishment of Electric 
Vehicle (“EV”) charging hubs and utilisation of EV bikes 
with battery swapping stations at our larger townships.
Beyond	financial	metrics	and	environmental	stewardship,	
EcoWorld Malaysia remains deeply committed to societal 
improvement, evidenced in our unwavering support 
for the Eco World Foundation. In FY2023, we allocated  
RM4.2 million (of which RM1.5 million was contributed 
by our contractors and business associates) towards 
corporate social responsibility (“CsR”) initiatives.  
Our efforts were backed by our employees who 
volunteered a total of 2,041 hours to support these  
noble endeavours. From the Students Aid Programme  
to the refurbishment of schools and improvement of 
public amenities, our aim is to alleviate the challenges 
faced by underserved schools, students, families and 
communities.

EcoWorld Malaysia’s execution track record and ability 
to transform adversity into opportunity sets the stage for 
sustained growth in the years to come. Our Statement  
of Financial Position’s health, ample cash balances and 
low net gearing places us in very good stead to acquire 
more landbank for future growth.
I	am	confident	that	we	are	well-positioned	to	capitalise	 
on the many more promising opportunities that will  
unfold for the Group in the years to come. Even as we  
look back in celebration of what has been achieved,  
we look forward with excitement on how we will be 
growing, expanding and extending the range of  
products and services that we offer under each of our 
four revenue pillars.
noTE oF AppRECIATIon
On behalf of the Board, I want to express my appreciation 
to the entire EcoWorld community which includes  
our customers, business associates, bankers and 
shareholders for your unwavering support over the past 
decade, which we are sincerely grateful for.
To Team EcoWorld, your passion, dedication and 
teamwork have enabled the Group to consistently 
deliver outstanding results. The tenacity, perseverance 
and commitment to excellence and innovation you have 
demonstrated individually and collectively have played  
a pivotal role in shaping the success we celebrate today.
We would like to extend our gratitude to Dato’  
Noor	 Farida	 binti	 Mohd	 Ariffin	 who	 will	 be	 retiring	
from the Board in March 2024. Dato’ Noor has been 
our Independent Non-Executive Director for nine 
years since 2015, serving as the Chairperson of the 
Remuneration Committee and as a member of the  
Audit and Nomination Committees. Her warmth, 
compassion, wisdom and wit have enlivened many Board 
meetings and the deep insights she was able to offer 
from decades of public service in the diplomatic, legal 
and	judicial	arena	have	benefited	the	Group	immensely.
I also take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome  
to Mr. Ng Soon Lai @ Ng Siek Chuan, our new  
Independent Non-Executive Director, effective 22 June 
2023. With over 32 years of experience in the audit  
and	 financial	 services	 sectors,	 we	 look	 forward	 to	 
receiving his valuable contributions to the Board.
As we stand at the threshold of a new decade, we aspire 
to do even better by partnering with our stakeholders to 
deliver a brighter, more equitable and prosperous future 
for all. Together, let us strengthen the EcoWorld brand 
by working to deliver exceptional value, embracing 
innovation and sustainability as our guiding principles in 
our quest to create an Exceptional Tomorrow & Beyond.
Thank you for being on this journey with us.

EcoWorld Malaysia celebrated our 10 th anniversary in FY2023, a landmark  
coming-of-age moment for us as a property developer. The Group achieved  
RM3.6 billion sales in FY2023, exceeding our target of RM3.5 billion, with strong 
contributions by every market segment and geographic region.
DATo’ ChAnG KhIM WAh

Our Iskandar Malaysia projects performed especially  
well.	 Collective	 sales	 from	 our	 five	 Eco Townships 
and three Eco Business Parks reached an impressive 
RM1.59 billion in FY2023. Over the past decade, 
we have successfully sold more than 12,500 units of 
properties with cumulative values exceeding RM10.92 
billion in Iskandar Malaysia, which averages more than 
RM1 billion per annum from the southern region alone.
EcoWorld	Malaysia	has	also	expanded	and	diversified	
well beyond our roots as a township developer.  
With four sizeable revenue pillars now contributing 
strongly to sales, we were able to serve every segment 
of the residential, commercial and industrial markets. 
The performance of each revenue pillar in FY2023 is 
discussed below.
ECo BUsInEss pARKs
It was another record-breaking year for our industrial 
segment, with combined sales of RM1.04 billion 
achieved in FY2023, the highest ever recorded in 
a single year. Sales comprised a balanced mix of  
ready-built factories, customised built-to-suit industrial 
units and industrial lands. This pillar has seen  
exponential growth in recent years recording an 
overwhelming increase of 374% from FY2020, giving 
rise	to	a	4-year	compounded	annual	growth	rate	of	68%.

The residential segment, which remains the core of 
the Group’s business, recorded a combined total of  
RM2.05 billion in sales under the Eco Townships and Eco 
Rise pillars.
This year, EcoWorld recorded RM1.47 billion from sales 
of homes within our Eco Townships that were priced 
above	RM650,000,	representing	72%	of	residential	sales	
and 41% of total sales in FY2023. The sustained demand 
for our higher-end products is testament to the strength 
of the EcoWorld brand in the upgrader and aspirational 
segment as customers continue to be drawn to the 
EcoWorld DNA	exemplified	in	our	Eco Townships.
Meanwhile,	homes	priced	below	RM650,000	contributed	
RM577 million sales, mainly from the duduk series 
of apartments under the Eco Rise	 pillar.	 The	 first	 
two duduk launches in the Klang Valley, namely Huni 
D’ Eco Ardence and Se.Ruang D’ Eco Sanctuary are 
fully sold and expected to be completed and handed 
over in the 1st half of FY2024. Hana D’ Eco Ardence,  
our third in this series, was launched in FY2023 with  
strong take-up rates. Following the success seen in the 
Klang	Valley,	 we	 then	 introduced	 the	 first	 duduk 
apartments in Penang, Ceria D’ Eco Horizon and in 
Iskandar Malaysia, Sa.Young D’ Eco Botanic.
The unique value propositions offered by duduk of 
attainable pricing, highly matured locations with ample 
lifestyle retail, F&B as well as other recreational and 
family-friendly amenities complement the upgrader and 
luxury homes under our Eco Townships. This enables us 
to cater to every market segment within the residential 
space covering a broad range of price points across 
every generation.
Sales of commercial properties totalled RM515 million 
during the year, a 15% increase from FY2022 and 
33% above the average annual sales achieved from  
FY2020-2022. Sales in FY2023 mainly comprised 
properties launched across the Northern, Southern and 
Central regions such as Ceria Square at Eco Horizon,  
Eco Biz III at Eco Tropics, Hana Square at Eco Ardence 
and SilverSquare at Eco Majestic, amongst others.
The encouraging growth of this revenue pillar is  
testament to the success of the Group’s placemaking  
efforts	 in	 developing	 strata	 and	 shop	 offices	
complemented by ample lifestyle and recreational 
amenities. Increasingly more investors and business 
owners are drawn to our matured townships with its 
relatively	affluent,	diverse	and	fast-growing	population.	
Further, strong take-ups of our Eco Hubs products 
help create a virtuous transformative cycle as greater 
commercial vibrancy enhances the liveability of our 
townships,	benefitting	not	just	our	residents	but	also	the	
wider population living in the vicinity of our projects.

70% of industrial sales came from Iskandar Malaysia in 
FY2023. We kicked off the year with a strategic sale of 
92 acres of industrial land at EBP II to Haitian Group, 
a leading industrial equipment manufacturer from 
China specialising in the production of a wide range of 
energy saving, eco-friendly and high precision industrial 
machines and solutions.
Our concerted efforts to build up our network and 
actively pursue leads with industrialists have expanded 
our customer base to include more than 1,100 local 
and multinational players now operating at our business  
parks located across Iskandar Malaysia and the Klang 
Valley.
Meanwhile, riding on the robust demand from the 
industrial sector, we acquired 403.78 acres of land in  
Kulai, Iskandar Malaysia during the year, which is 
planned for the development of EBP VI. This will be our 
fifth	business	park,	targeted	for	launch	in	FY2025	with	 
an estimated gross development value (“GDV ”) of 
RM1.58 billion.

FInAnCIAL REVIEW
Malaysian operations
EcoWorld Malaysia recorded 
revenue of RM2.23 billion in FY2023, 
9.0% higher than in FY2022, whilst 
gross	profit	 was	 RM538.6	 million,	
an increase of 9.8% from FY2022. 
Gross	profit	margin	for	FY2023	was	
24.2% which is on par with the 24.0% 
recorded in FY2022.
The share of results from our 
Malaysian joint ventures - Eco 
Grandeur, EBP V, Eco Ardence, Eco 
Horizon and BBCC, was RM117.5 
million, a slight increase from 
FY2022.
The Group’s Malaysian operations 
recorded PAT of RM284.7 million in 
FY2023, the highest ever achieved 
to date. As compared to FY2022 it 
was 1.2% higher, mainly due to the 
increase	in	gross	profit	and	higher	
interest income earned.
With the increasing maturity of our 
development portfolio, we have 
entered a highly cash-generative 
phase of our project lifecycle.  
This contributed to the record 
RM1.36	 billion	 cash	 and	 bank	
balances (including short-term 
funds) as at 31 October 2023 even as 
total borrowings were pared down.  
As a result, the Group’s net gearing 
further reduced to 0.25 times,  
the lowest level attained in 10 years.
Premised on the above, EcoWorld 
Malaysia was able to further increase 
dividends to our shareholders,  
with	 a	 total	 of	 6	 sen	 per	 share	
declared for FY2023, up from 5 sen 
per share in FY2022 and 4 sen per 
share in FY2021.
Eco World International Berhad (“EWI”)
EWI achieved RM1.2 billion sales in FY2023 which generated substantial  
cash, enabling it to distribute an interim dividend of RM792.0 million and  
declare	a	final	dividend	of	RM144.0	million	for	the	year.	EcoWorld	Malaysia’s	 
share	of	the	interim	and	final	dividend	is	RM213.8	million	and	RM38.9	million	
respectively, totalling RM252.7 million in dividends received and receivable 
from EWI for FY2023.
A lower loss was recorded by EWI in FY2023, of which EcoWorld  
Malaysia’s	share	 of	 loss	 amounted	 to	 RM13.4	 million,	 69%	 lower	 than	 in	
FY2022. This was largely due to:
•	Higher interest income earned following repayment of advances by its  
UK	joint	ventures,	namely	EcoWorld-Ballymore	and	EcoWorld	London;
•	Foreign exchange gains from appreciation of the British Pound (GBP)  
against the Malaysian Ringgit;
•	EWI’s reversal of impairment on its investment in EcoWorld-Ballymore  
of	 RM64.7	 million	 following	 significant	 progress	 in	 monetisation	 of	
inventories during the year (offset by impairment losses on the amount  
due from EcoWorld London of RM91.0 million); and
•	Lower	finance	costs	as	a	result	of	full	settlement	of	all	borrowings	during	 
the year.
GRoUp REsULTs InCLUDInG EWI
Following EWI’s reduction in the number of its future projects and continued 
deferral	of	new	launches	given	weak	property	market	conditions	in	the	UK,	
EcoWorld Malaysia reassessed the carrying values of its investment in EWI.  
As a result, an additional impairment of RM82 million was recognised in 
FY2023. This takes into consideration the higher weighted average cost of 
capital	applied	in	the	assessment,	in	view	of	further	increases	in	UK	interest	
rates during the year.
Notwithstanding the share of EWI’s loss and the impairment of the  
Group’s investment in EWI, the Group recorded a PAT of RM189.3 million for 
FY2023, an increase of 20% from FY2022.
This year, EcoWorld 
recorded RM1.47 billion 
from sales of homes 
within our Eco Townships 
that were priced above 
RM650,000, representing 
72% of residential sales 
and 41% of total sales in 
FY2023.

As at 31 October 2023, the Group’s future revenue 
remains healthy at RM3.49 billion, which provides us with 
clear	near	and	mid-term	earnings	and	cashflow	visibility.	
Accordingly, the Board is maintaining EcoWorld Malaysia’s 
FY2024 sales target at RM3.50 billion. This will enable 
the Group to focus on pursuing sustainable growth by 
improving absolute returns from our valuable landbank 
(whether via margin improvements or higher yield  
per sq ft of land developed). Our aim is to extend the 
life of our matured landbank to reap the rewards of our 
investments in value creation, thus improving our capacity 
to continue rewarding our shareholders with good 
dividend payments in the years to come.
For FY2024, we will continue diversifying our revenue 
stream across all four pillars. We will be bringing  
another duduk series to Iskandar Malaysia with  
Santai D’ Eco Spring . Meanwhile, Klang Valley will see 
more duduk launches, namely Riang D’ Eco Majestic 
and Se.Duduk D’ Kajang.
Se.Duduk D’ Kajang	 is	an	exciting	first	for	our	duduk 
apartments to be launched outside the Group’s Eco 
Townships. The land is situated in a matured locale that 
already enjoys the comprehensive lifestyle amenities 
associated with the duduk brand. Based on positive 
pre-marketing response, we believe the project will be 
a success which will open up interesting possibilities for 
further growth of the Eco Rise pillar beyond our own 
developments.
Under	 the	 Eco Hubs pillar we are revamping the 
commercial and retail space at BBCC to introduce a  
new F&B hub, Tuah 1895. This will add to our leasing 
portfolio which we have been gradually building up 
over the years within our townships and integrated 
developments.
The Group’s Eco Business Parks pillar is slated to 
continue experiencing strong demand, with a further 
boost expected from the Government’s New Industrial 
Masterplan 2030 launched in 2023. Prospects for 
Iskandar Malaysia are especially bright backed by 
extensive improvements in infrastructure, especially 
the ongoing construction of the Johor Bahru-Singapore 
RTS	link.	The	RTS	link,	once		completed,	will	significantly	
reduce commute time between the two cities and  
boost economic and commercial activities in the southern 
state. This will drive increased demand not just for 
industrial properties but also commercial and residential 
properties as well.
On the international front, EWI targets to sell out all its 
remaining stocks in FY2024 and distribute the excess 
cash generated (net of amounts required for its pared 
down operational requirements) back to shareholders. 
As at 31 October 2023, EWI has approximately  
RM850 million of completed and nearly-completed 
stocks that are available for sale, of which its effective 
share	is	approximately	RM650	million.
The potential receipt of more dividends from EWI in 
FY2024 will further add to EcoWorld Malaysia’s cash 
reserves and strengthen our capabilities to acquire  
new landbank.

EcoWorld Malaysia’s remaining landbank is

403.78 acres in Kulai, Iskandar Malaysia for the planned 
development of EBP VI	and	 6.92	 acres	 in	 Kajang,

Our plans for the remaining lands, which span three key

and	 flexibility	 to	 target	 product	 launches	 based	 on	
market needs and strength of demand. Meanwhile,

KEY CApITALs
Property development and its business operations rely on a wide range of resources and capital. These encompass 
both tangible and intangible forms of capital that are integral to the functioning of EcoWorld’s business model.  
These	assets	play	a	crucial	role	in	the	creation	of	value,	encompassing	both	financial	gains	and	non-financial	benefits.
Value Created by Capitals
  F    Financial Capital 
The investments that we hold extend beyond just properties where they are a strategic portfolio  
encompassing residential, industrial, commercial and township domains. Combined with our technological 
infrastructure,	this	capital	serves	as	the	basis	for	sustained	profitability	and	productivity,	driving	the	success	 
of our core business segments into the long-term.
Our	financial	capital	consists	of	our	total	cash	balances	and	short-term	funds	of	 
RM1.4 billion, RM8.9 billion in assets, RM2.5 billion in borrowings and RM4.8 billion  
in	shareholders’	fund.	Through	our	business	activities,	our	financial	capital	generated	 
RM2.2 billion in revenue and RM189.3 million in PAT. This reduced our net gearing  
to	0.25	times	which	allowed	us	to	boost	dividends	to	our	shareholders	to	6	sen	per	share	
in FY2023, up from 5 sen per share in FY2022.
   M    Manufactured Capital 
Our commitment to manufactured capital is seamlessly integrated into EcoWorld’s strategic investments to  
drive	business	growth.	It	signifies	more	than	physical	assets	where	it	is	a	meticulous	synergy	of	elements	that	 
foster success across our core business segments.
Our manufactured capital consists of our landbanks used for the development of  
our four revenue pillars: Eco Townships, Eco Rise, Eco Hubs and Eco Business Parks 
which	generated	RM3.6	billion	in	sales	in	FY2023.	With	3,400	acres	remaining,	 
we plan to diversify development across the four revenue pillars and to acquire more 
landbank.
   I    Intellectual Capital 
EcoWorld’s pursuit of excellence extends beyond the tangible. We consistently invest in advancing our  
knowledge and expertise, adopting a strategic, long-term approach to talent management. This investment  
in intellectual wealth propels our business with prudence and foresight.
We	implemented	10	new	systems,	67	automated	processes	and	45	business	
reengineering initiatives, resulting in a reduction in processing time from 2,835 to  
646	minutes.	Through	stringent	cyber	security	measures,	we	ensured	zero	breaches.	
We enhance our understanding of sustainable landscaping through biodiversity 
assessments at Eco Grandeur, contributing to our natural capital and facilitating the 
seamless integration of biodiversity into our design processes.
   s    social and Relationship Capital 
In forging enduring connections, we cultivate social and relational ties with our communities, business  
associates, regulators, employees and partners that empower us to develop sustainable projects and  
manage properties to create long-term value.
Engaging consistently with key stakeholders allows us to address their concerns  
(refer to Stakeholder Relationship on page 32). We allocated 100% of our procurement 
budget to local suppliers and vendors. Additionally, we allocated RM4.2 million  
in CSR programmes, with RM1.5 million raised from our business associates,  
benefiting	5,409	individuals	through	community	enrichment	initiatives.
   h    human Capital 
Our people are the dynamic pillar of our operations where their strength and commitment propels us forward.  
By placing emphasis on our people, we cultivate a workplace culture where collaboration and innovation not  
only	thrive	but	define	our	path	to	success.
Our 1,083 skilled employees form our valuable human capital. We invested  
RM524,474 in upskilling resulting in a 37% reduction in turnover and an 85% employee 
satisfaction score.
   n    natural Capital 
Natural capital to us transcends conventional landscaping. It represents a harmonious integration of  
sustainability practices within our developments. Beyond aesthetics, it is a pledge to enhance biodiversity,  
crafting spaces that coexist with nature and leaving an enduring green legacy for generations.
The Group’s 15% reduction in Scope 2 GHG emissions contributes to the global 
decarbonisation initiative, creating societal value. Our responsible waste management 
and recycling programmes also reduces environmental impact. At present,  
green spaces make up 22% of our developed lands which enhances property 
aesthetics, elevating market value.

In	 our	 rigorous	 materiality	 assessment	 process	 for	 FY2023,	 we	 meticulously	 identified	 and	 prioritised	 the	 
sustainability matters integral to EcoWorld. This strategic undertaking empowers us to not only formulate targeted 
sustainability strategies but also to adeptly integrate sustainability risks and seize emerging opportunities.  
By understanding and prioritising these material matters, we ensure a focused approach that aligns with our commitment 
to long-term value creation.
Moreover, our active engagement with stakeholders serves as a dynamic compass, enabling us to stay attuned to  
their evolving expectations. Through this ongoing dialogue, we not only create immediate value for our stakeholders 
but also mitigate the risk of long-term value erosion while fostering enduring value for EcoWorld.
1. Review
We reviewed our material matters 
and benchmarked them against 
Bursa Malaysia’s Sustainability 
Reporting Guide and industry best 
practices, assessing those that 
had potential impact in creating 
and preserving value for our 
stakeholders
2. Rank
We prioritised matters 
that were most material

*Renamed material matters
In the year under review, a thorough examination 
revealed the continued relevance of our material matters 
and the materiality matrix from FY2022 to both our 
current business operations and stakeholder interests. 
Recognising	the	 need	 for	 continued	 refinement,	 
we undertook the strategic initiative to rename three key 
material matters. This intentional adjustment is aimed  
at achieving a more precise alignment with Bursa 
Malaysia’s prescribed common material matters, as well 
as staying attuned to shifts in the economic landscape 
and prevailing industry trends.
Our commitment to excellence extends beyond the 
status quo, ensuring that our materiality framework 
evolves in concert with both regulatory expectations 
and the dynamic pulse of the industry. By recalibrating 
these material matters, we not only fortify our alignment 
with industry standards but also enhance the clarity and 
relevance of our sustainability strategy, thereby increasing 
our resilience in an ever-evolving business landscape.

oUR KEY RIsKs AnD  
IMpACTs
The	Group’s	financial	performance	and	operations	are	subject	to	various	risk	factors	that	could	affect	our	value	creation	
strategy. To proactively manage and mitigate these risks, we systematically identify and assess them, taking measures 
to	safeguard	our	business	and	the	value	we	generate. 
ACQUIsITIon oF UnsUITABLE LAnD
Description
 Land bank is crucial for the success and sustainability of  
the Group’s operations. Acquisition of land with high  
organic carbon such as peatland, primary forest reserves 
and/or land with high conservation value, may render 
financial	institutions	not	willing	to	consider	financing	the	
acquisition based on ESG criteria.
Land with hidden adverse topography or encumbrances 
as	well	as	over-priced	land	may	erode	the	Group’s	profit	
margin, causing eventual losses or even cash being  
tied up for long periods of time.
Impact to Value Creation
•		Adverse	impact	on	economic	performance	and	returns	 
on investment
•	Delay	in	project	launches	and	development	plans
Capitals Impacted
Material Matters
Mitigation Actions
 1.   Avoid acquisition of land with high conservation value 
including peatland and primary forest reserves for  
future developments.
2.   Conduct comprehensive feasibility and market studies.
3.   Prepare detailed business projection with due 
consideration	given	on	cashflow,	payback	period	and	
internal rate of return.
4.   Conduct studies on site accessibility, land condition, 
topography of the area and statutory requirements  
(e.g. condition of land use).
5.   Perform analysis on property trends, historical cost data 
and screened information obtained from local agencies 
and neighbouring developments.
6.			Engage	experienced	consultants	at	inception	stage	to	
perform due diligence including land searches.
LIQUIDITY
Description
 The Group’s operation is supported by funds generated 
from property sales and a combination of equity and 
borrowings.	Sufficient	liquidity	will	allow	the	Group	to	fund	
its development, overheads as well as pursue strategic 
opportunities such as acquisitions of new land banks for 
new development projects, investment in joint venture 
companies and ventures into new technologies that would 
bring an edge to the Group.
Impact to Value Creation
•			Insufficient	funding	can	impede	both	the	funding	of	
existing and future development projects, causing delays 
or deferment of project completion and new launches
•		Affect	the	Group’s	ability	to	service	loan	repayments	
•		Adverse	impact	on	the	Group’s	credit	rating	
Capitals Impacted
Material Matters
Mitigation Actions
	1.			Group	treasury’s	regular	cash	flow	forecasting	helps	
to anticipate liquidity needs and manage resources 
proactively to avoid potential shortfall. 
2.			Maintain	adequate	financial	facilities	to	allow	the	Group	
access to ready funds as and when required.
3.   Maintain close relationships with key bankers to 
understand their lending appetite and priorities and 
explore new funding opportunities in the capital market. 
4.			Undertake	continuous	financial	planning	to	consider	
contractual	obligations,	financial	impact	and	liquidity	
requirements, as well as optimising assets to ensure 
healthy	cash	flow	while	ensuring	all	financial	covenants	
are complied with. 
5.   Monitoring gearing ratio constantly through effective 
credit utilisation to ensure leverage is within acceptable 
levels and aligns with the Group’s growth aspirations  
and repayment capabilities. 
6.			Enhance	liquidity	through	continuous	monetisation	of	
unsold completed stocks into cash.
7.			Exercise	financial	discipline	to	achieve	cost	effectiveness	
through	ongoing	digitalisation	for	process	efficiency	and	
effectiveness, ultimately resulting in cash preservation. 
8.			Continue	to	strengthen	the	Group’s	financial	performance	
to ensure long-term sustainable growth through 
increased contributions from all business units of  
all regions.

Why is this Important?
Climate change presents an unparalleled threat to 
our planet, impacting ecosystems, communities and 
economies. Managing our carbon footprint contributes 
to the mitigation of adverse effects of climate change, 
paving the way for a more resilient and sustainable future.
EcoWorld is aligned with Malaysia’s targets to 
reduce GHG emissions per the Paris Agreement, 
encompassing a pledge to achieve a 45% reduction in 
overall carbon intensity across the economy by 2030, 
ultimately culminating in net zero emissions by 2050.  
The Malaysian government actively encourages 
private sector involvement, underscoring the urgency 
and collective responsibility to transition towards a  
low-carbon economy. Additionally, with an increased 
shift in the global investment landscape, climate 
change has also emerged as the predominant factor 
influencing	investment	decisions.
our Approach
The Group instituted a robust climate governance 
structure through the GOC to enhance the effectiveness 
of our approach in addressing climate change risks.
Towards net Zero – our Decarbonisation pathway
In	 FY2023,	 the	 Group	 developed	 its	 Net	 Zero	2050	
Roadmap, outlining Scope 2 emission reduction targets 
for 2025 and 2030, along with overarching milestones. 
The roadmap was formulated through an analysis 
of climate change impacts, assessing associated 
risks and opportunities. We align with global climate 
actions,	 adopting	 UN	 SDGs	 and	 TCFD	 reporting	
recommendations.

and	the	relocation	of	our	corporate	office	to	occupy	a	
more	streamlined	space	and	substantially	reduced	floor	 
space	within	a	GBI-certified	building	at	the	Stride,	BBCC.
GhG Emissions Management 
In FY2023, our overall GHG emissions totalled  
10,191 tCO 2e. Scope 1 emissions stemming from fuel 
consumption reached 595 tCO 2e in FY2023. 58% of 
the total emissions was attributed to Scope 2 emissions 
arising from electricity consumption. We began including 
Scope 3 emissions derived from employee commuting 
and business travels in FY2022 and in FY2023 we  
have expanded our Scope 3 emissions reporting to 
include waste generated. The total Scope 3 emissions 
amounted	to	3,673	tCO2e. 
We recorded a steady increase in our absolute energy 
consumption since 2021 by 17%. This increase can be 
attributed to operations returning to normal after the 
movement control order during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Note: 
1. Scope 2 emissions data represents the energy consumption at sales 
galleries in project sites from Eco North, Eco Central and Eco South 
including	our	main	office	at	Setia	Alam.	In	FY2023,	Eco	Meadows	has	
been	excluded	from	our	reporting	scope.	FY2021	and	FY2022	figures	
have	be	restated	to	exclude	consumption	from	commercial	tenants.
2. Scope 2 emissions calculations uses the location-based method  
as outlined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Emission factors 
were sourced from the National Energy Commission: Grid Emission 
Factor	2019	for	operations	in	Peninsular	Malaysia.
3. Scope 1 and 3 emission factors were sourced from the UK Government’s 
GHG	Conversion	Factor	2023.	Calculation	methodologies	were	based	
on the GHG Protocol Scope 1 and 3 Guidance. 
4.  For the calculation of the Group’s Scope 3 emissions for employee 
commute and business travel, we employed the distance-based method.
5.  Emissions from waste generated were calculated using the  
waste-type-specific	method,	specifically	accounting	for	disposed	and	
recycled construction waste. The analysis encompassed emissions  
from 13 out of the 18 types of construction waste generated at 
EcoWorld, utilising conversion factors outlined in the UK Government’s

and have also launched a new recycling 
station at Eco Galleria in June 2023 in 
conjunction with World Environment  
Day. The items that were recycled 
included plastic, glass, paper, cardboard, 
textile and e-waste. We also organised 
various activities, such as a Cooking  
Oil to Soap Workshop, to promote 
sustainable practices and demonstrate the 
possibilities of recycling and upcycling.

Why is it Important?
Implementation of sound environmental monitoring at our construction sites is integral to prevent, minimise and 
mitigate negative impacts on the environment. It also ensures compliance with environmental plans, permits and  
other regulations.
our Approach
High-volume air sampler used to monitor 
particulate matter at our construction sites
Noise monitoring near residential areas
Adherence to construction activity 
timings
Utilisation	of	jack-in	piles	as	a	
replacement for the drop hammer in 
the piling method
Utilisation	of	noise	hoardings
Monthly noise monitoring at 
township development areas
Erosion and sediment Control
Our erosion and sediment control management comprises soil 
erosion minimisation, sediment prevention control, runoff and 
stormwater	 flow	 control.	 We	 adhere	 to	 the	 Guideline	 for	 Erosion	
and Sediment Control established by the Department of Irrigation  
and Drainage Malaysia.
Construction of sedimentation ponds
Installations of silt fences
Slope stabilisation monitoring
Earth drain monitoring
Installation of check dams
Air Emissions Control
Effective air quality management at construction sites is crucial for 
safeguarding public health. We ensure compliance with Malaysia 
Ambient Air Quality Standards and mitigate environmental impact  
by reducing air pollution.
Monthly monitoring of emissions to comply with the permissible 
limit set by the DOE
Extraction of water from detention ponds to wash tyres of vehicles 
entering and exiting the construction site for dust control
noise Control
We implement various noise reduction and control measures in line 
with the Occupational Safety and Health (Noise Exposure) Regulation 
2019 and Guideline for Environmental Noise Limits and Control at our 
construction sites.
For detailed information on the sediment, air emissions and 
noise control measures, refer to EcoWorld’s Sustainability Report 
FY2023, page 57.

Bird Biodiversity Assessment
We carried out a bird diversity assessment to identify  
the local and migrant bird species that occur in 
and around the site. We recorded a total of 83 bird 
species	during	 the	 study	 with	 13	 confirmed	 to	 be	
migrants indicating rich bird diversity in the township.  
With an improved knowledge on the bird diversity at 
Eco Grandeur, we aim to better plan the formation of 
lakes, ponds, waterways and monsoon drains in the 
development and increase our efforts in improving the 
overall food web to support a healthy ecosystem.
Fish Biodiversity Assessment
A	 study	 on	 the	 fish	 biodiversity	 in	 waterbodies	 of	 
Eco Grandeur was also conducted during the  
reporting period. This study provided information 
on the Group’s waterscape planning and design to 
ensure sustainable habitats for the aquatic elements at 
the township. We found a high number of introduced 
species which may increase disruption of the ecological 
process. As such, the Group has aimed to enrich the 
pond	to	host	peat	swamp	native	fish	species.
Insect Biodiversity Assessment
The Group also studied the insect diversity at Eco Grandeur 
with	a	focus	on	the	butterfly,	damselfly	and	dragonfly	species.	 
We	recorded	a	total	of	45	butterfly,	8	damselfly	and	22	dragonfly	
species. This data acts as a baseline for bioindicator insects.  
The Group is looking into landscape enrichment to increase the 
level of insect biodiversity throughout Eco Grandeur.

BIoDIVERsITY
Why is it Important?
Preserving diverse plant and animal life not only supports sustainable societies but also enhances the aesthetic  
appeal and liveability of our development projects, striking a harmonious balance between the built and natural  
environment. Biodiversity is integral to the soil health of our townships, playing a vital role in carbon sequestration and 
groundwater recharge.
our Approach
In FY2023, we maintained our biodiversity conservation initiatives by avoiding the sourcing of land with high 
conservation value, including peatlands and primary forest reserves for township developments. Our development 
projects are designed to preserve the landscape’s natural vegetation, drainage patterns and water bodies.
This year, we conducted a biodiversity assessment at our largest township, Eco Grandeur, as part of our initiative  
to achieve aspirations under the Biodiversity Masterplan 2018-2028. This assessment allows the Group to  
understand the diversity of species, ecosystems and habitats within the vicinity of the township, contributing to the 
enhancement of our landscape planning and design.

 Code of Conduct and Ethics
 In creating a robust corporate culture that fosters 
high standards of ethical conduct, transparency 
and accountability, the Board has adopted several 
policies, programmes and codes to guide Directors,

Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme (“ACC 
Programme”), the ABC Policy, the Directors’ Code  
of Conduct and Ethics (“Code for Directors”) and  
the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics for 
Employees (“Code for Employees”). 
 The ACC Programme, which is based on the  
Guidelines on Adequate Procedures issued 
under Section 17A(5) of the Malaysian  
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009 (Amended 
2018), was launched on a Group-wide basis in year 
2020. The ACC Programme is reviewed annually  
to assess the effectiveness of anti-corruption  
efforts implemented by the Group. 
 The ABC Policy was last revised on 23 March 2023 
to formalise the inclusion of the joint ventures  
and associate companies. The Code for Directors  
was	 last	 revised	 on	 26	 October	 2023	 to	 reflect	 
the relevant updates under the revised Guide on 
Code for Company Director & Company Secretary. 
 During FY2023, the Directors of the Company

working environment where employees and/or 
stakeholders may report any incident of alleged 
improper	conduct	 confidentially	 without	 fear	 of	
reprisal to the WC. The Whistleblowing Policy 
outlines the procedures for dealing with matters 
lodged by whistleblowers. The Whistleblowing 
Policy and written procedures were revised by 
the	Board	on	26	October	2023	to	align	with	the

sustainable	and	profitable	returns	while	minimising	
risks.
 EcoWorld’s investment philosophy is rooted in 
the principles of value investing, which prioritise

 sustainability
 The Board and Management are dedicated 
to advancing sustainability throughout the 
Group’s activities and the communities it serves.  
The implementation of the Group’s business 
sustainability practices has been overseen by the 
Sustainability Committee since the year 2017.  
The Sustainability Report 2023 (“SR 2023”) and  
the	 Sustainability	 Statement	 on	 pages	 46	 to	 69

 The NC assists the Board in the evaluation of the 
performance of the Board, Board Committees and 
individual Directors as well as in the consideration 
of potential candidates for appointment to the 
Board. The NC consists exclusively of Independent 
Directors. 
 Following the retirement of Mr. Tang Kin Kheong 
and Dato’ Haji Obet Bin Tawil at the 49th Annual 
General Meeting of the Company (“AGM”),  
Mr. Ng Soon Lai @ Ng Siek Chuan was appointed 
to the Board on 22 June 2023. The Board now

who is the Alternate Director of Tan Sri Liew,  
is not taken into account in computing the Board 
composition.

 Dato’	Noor	Farida	Binti	Mohd	Ariffin	who	will	reach	
a tenure of 9 years at the forthcoming 50 th AGM  
will not be seeking re-election, in line with Practice 
5.3 of the MCCG, which does not encourage 
Independent Directors to serve for more than  
9 years. The Board will continue to source for 
a suitable candidate to replace her as soon as 
possible to ensure compliance with Practice 5.2  
of the MCCG, which requires the Board to comprise 
a majority of Independent Directors.  
 As the Board is still undergoing a period of 
refreshment in line with Practice 5.3 of the MCCG, 
the Board is of the view that the engagement of 
independent experts to perform a formal and 
objective Board evaluation as required under 
Practice	6.1	of	the	MCCG	should	be	deferred	until	
the composition of the Board has been stabilised. 
Further details on the annual Board evaluation 
conducted by the NC are set out in the NC Report 
on	page	96	of	this	IAR.	
 The composition, authority, duties and 
responsibilities of the NC and the summary of  
work carried out to discharge its duties for FY2023  
are	set	out	in	the	NC	Report	on	pages	92	to	96	 
of this IAR.
III.  REMUnERATIon
 Remuneration policies and procedures for Directors 
and C-Suite Management Personnel are developed, 
reviewed, revised and implemented by the RC, 
which consists exclusively of Independent Directors. 
 Since the year 2020, the Group has departed from 
Practice 8.2 of the MCCG which requires disclosure 
of the remuneration of the top 5 Senior Management 
personnel on a named basis in bands of RM50,000 
as the Board is of the view that such information,  
if disclosed, raises personal security concerns on 
the part of the Senior Management personnel and 
could result in employee poaching by competitors. 
The alternative form of disclosure (on an unnamed 
basis in bands of RM50,000) is outlined in the  
CG Report which is available on the Company’s 
website at www.ecoworld.my. 
 The detailed composition, authority, duties and 
responsibilities of the RC and the summary of 
work carried out to discharge its duties for FY2023  
are detailed in the RC Report on pages 97 to 98  
of this IAR.

the detailed duties and responsibilities of the  
AC as well as a summary of the work performed to 
fulfil	its	duties	for	FY2023,	are	described.
 Assessment of suitability, objectivity and 
Independence of the External Auditors
 The AC is responsible for the audit quality as well 
as the suitability, objectivity, effectiveness and 
independence of external auditors in establishing 
the	standards	and	reliability	of	the	audited	financial	
statements and conducts an assessment annually. 
The AC ensures that any non-audit services  
provided	 by	 external	 auditors	 do	 not	 conflict	 
with their principal role as auditors and that the  
non-audit	 fees	 incurred	 are	 not	 significant	 
(constitute less than 50% of the total amount of  
audit fees payable to the external auditors).
 The Board has in place an External Auditors 
Assessment Policy (“EAA Policy”) which outlines 
the necessary guidelines and procedures in 
evaluating the performance of the external auditors.  
A minimum of 3 years cooling-off period has to be 
observed before a former partner of the external 
audit	firm	can	be	appointed	as	a	member	of	the	
AC. The EAA Policy is available on the Company’s 
website at www.ecoworld.my. 
 During its meeting held on 14 November 2023, 
the AC assessed the performance, competency, 
independence, technical capabilities and resource 
sufficiency	 of	 the	 external	 auditors.	 As	 part	 of	
the assessment, the AC referred to the Annual 
Transparency Report issued by our external auditors, 
Baker Tilly Monteiro Heng PLT (“Baker Tilly”).  
Based	 on	 the	 assessment,	 the	 AC	 was	 satisfied	
with the independence and performance of Baker 
Tilly and recommended to the Board to put forth  
a proposal for the re-appointment of Baker Tilly at 
the forthcoming 50th AGM. 
 Assessment of the Internal Audit Function
 The AC is also responsible for assessing the internal 
audit function, including reviewing the adequacy 
of scope, functions, competency, resources, and 
independence carried out by the Group Corporate 
Governance (“GCG”) team.
 The internal audit plan was reviewed and approved 
by the AC. GCG would report to the AC on its audit 
findings	on	a	quarterly	basis.

assessment,	the	AC	was	satisfied	with	the	overall	
performance of GCG in FY2023.
 In FY2023, the AC also engaged the Institute of 
Internal Auditors Malaysia (“IIAM”) to perform an 
external Quality Assurance Review (“QAR”) on  
GCG by virtue of self-assessment undertaken by 
GCG with independent validation by IIAM on the 
self-assessment result. The AC noted that based  
on the QAR, GCG has been assessed to have 
generally conformed with all applicable standards 
of the Institute of Internal Auditors (“IIA”).
II.  RIsK MAnAGEMEnT AnD InTERnAL ConTRoL 
FRAMEWoRK
 The Board is responsible for ensuring both the 
adequacy and integrity of the Group’s internal  
control systems and the existence of a sound 
framework for internal controls and risk  
management.
 The Board has in place an effective Enterprise Risk 
Management (“ERM”) framework that outlines the 
Group’s risk management system including risk 
identification,	assessment,	management,	mitigation,	
monitoring and governance. 
 The Risk Management Committee (“RMC”)  
comprises Senior Management, oversees risk 
management matters within the Group and reports 
to the AC on a half-yearly basis on the Group’s 
aggregated	risk	position	and	significant	risk	issues.	
The RMC ensures that the implementation of 
the RMPG is properly carried out throughout the  
Group by Management. Additionally, the RMC 
also conducts an annual review of the Group’s risk 
parameters to ensure that changes in circumstances 
of	risk	appetite	are	accurately	reflected	in	the	risk	
parameters.
 GCG undertakes the internal audit function and 
assists the AC in assessing the effectiveness of the 
Group’s governance, risk management and internal 
control processes. The Integrity Team is responsible 
for the effective operation of the ACC Programme. 
 
 The RMC comprises the following members:

2023)
Divisional General Manager, 
Eco South
Lim Eng Tiong Divisional General Manager, 
Group Contracts Division
Ong Yew Leng General Manager,  
Digital Technology Services 
 The Group’s ERM framework is based on the  
ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Guidelines 
where its elements have been integrated into 
the Group’s RMPG, which was approved by the  
Board in June 2018. The Group’s risk management 
process and the communication of these risks have 
been laid out in the RMPG.
 The Group’s Risk Appetite Statement was issued  
during	the	financial	year	ended	31	October	2022.	 
This statement clearly outlines the amount of risk  
the Group is willing to take, or the Group’s risk 
capacity. It was issued to provide clear guidelines 
on the risk parameters that must be observed in 
the attainment of the Group’s strategic goals and 
targets. 
 During FY2023, the Board revised the Group’s 
Risk Appetite Statement to incorporate elements 
of climate change risk and adjusted the risk  
parameters	 to	 better	 reflect	 the	 Group’s	 risk	 
appetite. The RMPG document was also revised  
to align with the Group’s latest risk parameters and 
Risk Appetite Statement. 
	 EcoWorld	 recognises	 the	 critical	 significance	 of	
adhering to internal control processes. The Group 
has established the Quality Management System 
(“QMS”) and Environment Management System 
(“EMS”), both of which have received successful 
accreditation from SIRIM since the year 2014, 
aligning with the ISO 9001:2015 standard for  
QMS and ISO 14001:2015 standard for EMS.  
A	 clearly	 defined	 set	 of	 business	 operations	and	
processes has been implemented and maintained  
to foster consistent practices. In our relentless

Internal audit function 
The GCG is the in-house internal audit function  
established to provide independent and objective 
assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the governance, risk management and internal 
control systems and processes implemented by the  
Management. GCG reports functionally to the AC.  
All GCG members are independent of the activities 
it audits and from the day-to-day operations of the 
business	 units,	 and	 free	 from	 conflicts	 of	 interest	 or	
any relationships that could affect their objectivity and 
independence as internal auditors.
The AC reviews GCG’s resource requirements,  
authority and functionality, and staff competency on an 
annual basis to ensure that the internal audit function  
is adequately and appropriately resourced and  
equipped to carry out its duties effectively.  
The	 qualifications	 of	 the	 Head	 of	 GCG	 and	 the	
departmental resources are comprehensively outlined  
in the CG Report, which can be accessed on the 
Company’s website at www.ecoworld.my. 
GCG conducts its internal audits in accordance with  
the approved internal audit annual plan 2023  
(“IAAP23”) approved by the AC in September 2022. 
The IAAP23 was developed based on a risk-based 
approach while the COSO Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework Principles was used to assess the adequacy 
and effectiveness of internal controls. The IAAP23 also 
took into consideration the Group’s key strategies,  
AC’s and Management’s feedback on their areas of 
concerns and potential risks.
GCG is guided by the Audit Charter and Audit 
Methodology approved by the AC, while its processes 
and activities are governed by the Group’s Code and 
Conducts and Business Ethics and the International 
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal  
Auditing laid down in IPPF, a conceptual framework 
promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors (“IIA”).
The Quality Assurance and Improvement Programme 
(“QAIP”) continues to be used to assess the quality of 
the audit works against the International Standards 
promulgated by IIA. During FY2023, GCG adopted a 
Self-Assessment with Independent Validation (“SAIV”) 
for a 5-yearly QAR exercise. The QAR Team from IIAM 
concluded that the works performed by GCG had 
generally conformed to the mandatory elements and 
standards	 of	 the	 IPPF.	 The	 AC	 was	 satisfied	 with	 the	
overall performance of GCG. 
The works carried out by GCG for FY2023 included the 
following:
• Developed the risk-based IAAP23 for FY2023 
and revised the IAAP23 accordingly, taking 
into consideration of the latest developments  
surrounding the business operating environment, 
and the needs to address uncertainties and concerns 
arising from current audits.
•		 Reviewed and tested the system of internal control 
on key operating processes based on the approved 
internal audit annual plan using a risk-based  
approach and progressively issuing detailed internal 
audit reports to the AC; 
•		 Follow-up audits were conducted to determine the 
status of previous audit recommendations;
•	 During FY2023, GCG completed 13 assurance 
assignments which covered key processes at 
support units and business units across the Northern, 
Southern and Central regions. These reports  
together with follow-up reports were tabled at the 
quarterly AC meetings for deliberation;
•		 Reviewed RPTs on a quarterly basis to ensure that 
those transactions were on terms not more favourable 
than those generally available to the public; and 
•		 Reviewed recurring RPTs on a quarterly basis in 
accordance with the guidelines set out in the circular 
to shareholders for recurrent RPTs of a revenue or 
trading nature. 
The total cost incurred in maintaining the internal  
audit function for FY2023 was RM0.84 million  
(FY2022: RM0.70 million), comprising mainly salaries, 
bonuses, medical allowances, staff trainings, travelling 
and accommodation expenses and subsistence 
allowances for audit assignments.

responsibilities of the NC. The proposed 
changes were recommended to the Board

(c) The NC Report was reviewed and issued for

(“IAR”).
Board Composition
The Board
To	ensure	 the	 Board	 efficiently	 discharges	 its	 duties,	 
the NC annually reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board. 
Following the changes to the Board composition in 
FY2023 as noted below:
•	 retirement of Mr. Tang Kin Kheong and  
Dato’ Haji Obet Bin Tawil as Independent Directors  
on 30 March 2023; and
•	 appointment of Mr. Ng Soon Lai @ Ng Siek Chuan  
as Independent Director on 22 June 2023, 
the Board now comprises 11 Directors, with a majority 
of Independent Directors and the percentage of 
women	 Directors	 is	 36%.	 Datuk	 Heah	 Kok	 Boon	 
who is the Alternate Director to Tan Sri Dato’ Sri 
Liew Kee Sin, is not taken into account in computing  
Board composition.
The NC noted the intention of Dato’ Noor Farida Binti 
Mohd	Ariffin	(“Dato’	Noor	Farida”)	to	retire	and	not	seek	
re-election at the forthcoming 50 th AGM to be in line 
with Practice 5.3 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate 
Governance (“MCCG”), which does not encourage  
the tenure of an independent director to exceed a term 
limit	of	9	years.	Hence,	she	will	hold	office	as	Director	 
until the conclusion of the forthcoming 50 th AGM.  
In view of the retirement of Dato’ Noor Farida at the 
forthcoming 50 th AGM, the NC will source for new 
candidate(s) to ensure compliance with MCCG and  
to enhance the composition of the Board. 
Independent Directors
According to Practice 5.3 of the MCCG, the tenure of 
an independent director shall not exceed a cumulative 
term	limit	of	9	years.	Upon	completion	of	the	9	years,	 
an independent director may continue to serve on 
the board as a non-independent director. If the board  
intends to retain an independent director beyond  
the 9-year tenure (but shall not exceed 12 years),  
it should justify and seek annual shareholders’ approval 
through a two-tier voting process subject to prior 
assessment by the NC. 
With the retirement of Dato’ Noor Farida at the 
forthcoming 50 th AGM, the number of Independent 
Directors	will	reduce	from	6	to	5,	which	is	50%	of	the	 
total number of Directors on the Board. Hence, will  
not comply with Practice 5.2 of the MCCG whereby 
a majority of the Board must comprise Independent 
Directors. The Board will source for new candidate  
to replace Dato’ Noor Farida before the end of the  
next	financial	year	to	ensure	compliance	to	the	MCCG.
Board Diversity
The Board recognises that diversity in perspective,  
skills, experience, expertise, age and gender as well as 
the requisite independence among Board members 
ensures the competitive advantage of the Group in 
the industry. As such, the Board adopted an Equality, 
Diversity and Inclusion (“EDI”) Policy with the aim of 
maintaining a Board comprising Directors from a  
diverse blend of backgrounds for its successful 
functioning. The Fit & Proper Policy was also adopted 
to serve as a guide to ensure all Directors of the  
Group have the necessary character, experience,  
integrity, competence, and time to effectively discharge 
their role as Directors of the Group. Both the Fit &  
Proper Policy and the EDI Policy are available on the 
Company’s website at www.ecoworld.my.

In appointing Directors, certain factors are considered 
by the NC. These include background, knowledge,  
fit	and	proper	criteria	(integrity,	competency,	experience	
and commitment), potential contribution to the Group,  
the current composition of the Board and Board 
Committees, the current and future needs of the 
Group, boardroom diversity, tenure of each Director,  
any	 existing	 or	 potential	 conflict	 of	 interest,	 and	 for	
appointment as Independent Directors, the candidates’ 
independence. This is in line with the Group’s practice 
of being an equal opportunity employer where all 
appointments are strictly based on merit.  
For the recommendation on re-election of retiring 
Directors, a satisfactory evaluation based on  
performance and contribution to the Board is required. 
The assessment and recommendation of the NC and 
the Board on the proposed re-election of the retiring 
Directors at the forthcoming 50th AGM are set out in  
the explanatory notes to the Notice of the 50 th AGM.  
The	profiles	of	the	retiring	Directors	are	set	out	in	the	
Board	Profiles	on	pages	70,	73	and	75	of	this	IAR.
Board Evaluation 
The Board has deferred the engagement of  
independent experts to perform a Board evaluation 
as mentioned on page 85 of this IAR. For FY2023,  
the NC continued to carry out the annual assessment  
and evaluation of the Board and Board Committees 
in terms of its effectiveness in areas including 
responsibilities, composition, decision-making and 
boardroom activities. This also included reviewing its 
performance in addressing the Company’s material 
sustainability risks and opportunities.  
The Board and Board Committees were assessed 
collectively, based on structure, processes and 
responsibilities. The individual Directors self-assessed 
their commitment, integrity, skills, contribution, 
performance, character and personality, as well as 
understanding of the Group’s environmental, social 
& governance strategy. With regards to Independent 
Directors, their independence was also assessed. 
The NC had on 14 November 2023 reviewed the 
questionnaires in the performance evaluation forms to 
ensure that they remained relevant.
The evaluation results were reviewed by the NC.  
Upon	 assessing	 the	 results,	 the	 NC	 concluded	 that	
they	 were	 generally	 satisfied	 with	 the	 effectiveness	
of the Board as a whole as well as the effectiveness of  
various	 committees.	 The	 NC	 was	 also	 satisfied	 with	 
the contribution and performance of each Director,  
the Chairman of the Board, the current size and 
composition of the Board as well as their skill sets,  
and the independence of the Independent Directors. 
The Corporate Governance Report sets out the details 
of the processes and criteria used in the evaluation as 
well as the evaluation results, which is available on the 
Company’s website at www.ecoworld.my.

Remuneration policy and procedures for Directors and C-suite Management personnel
The Director’s and C-Suite Remuneration Policies are guided by these principles:
The remuneration packages for both Executive Directors 
and C-Suite Management Personnel reward both 
corporate and individual performance and comprise 
both	fixed	and	variable	elements.	The	remuneration	is	
competitive and consistent with industry standards as  
well as the complexity of the business and the role. 
Executive Directors do not deliberate on their own 
remuneration and excuse themselves from the meeting 
during the relevant agenda. 
The remuneration packages of the Non-Executive 
Directors	 comprise	 a	 fixed	 fee,	 meeting	 allowances	
and	 benefits	 that	 are	 not	 linked	 to	 financial	 results.	 
The	 remuneration	 packages	 are	 structured	 to	 reflect	
the roles, responsibilities, experience required and  
time demanded in discharging their duties and 
responsibilities. The remuneration payable to the 
Non-Executive Directors is subject to the approval 
of shareholders at the AGM. Directors who are also 
shareholders will abstain from voting at the AGM to 
approve their own remuneration. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy and the C-Suite 
Remuneration Policy are available on the Company’s 
website at www.ecoworld.my.  
Remuneration of Directors and Top 5 senior 
Management personnel 
The remuneration of Directors on a named basis for 
FY2023 is disclosed in the CG Report which is available 
on the Company’s website at www.ecoworld.my. 
As explained in the Corporate Governance Overview 
Statement, the Board has decided not to apply Practice 
8.2 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 
which requires the disclosure of the remuneration of  
the top 5 Senior Management personnel on a named 
basis in bands of RM50,000. The alternative form of 
disclosure is set out in the CG Report which is available 
on the Company’s website at www.ecoworld.my.

RISk MAnAGEMEnt & IntERnAl COntROl 
The Board of EcoWorld Malaysia is pleased to present our Statement on Risk Management and  
InternalControlforthefinancialyearended31October2023.TheStatementisinlinewithParagraph
15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia and in compliance with the  
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers endorsed 
byBursaMalaysia. 
The Group has also complied with Principle B of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 
2021 which requires the Board of a listed issuer to establish and maintain a sound risk management  
frameworkandinternalcontrolsystem. 
BoARD REsponsIBILITY  
The Board is responsible for maintaining a sound risk 
management framework and internal control system  
to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the  
Group’s	 assets.	 The	 Board	 affirms	 the	 importance	 of	
establishing the tone at the top. This involves setting 
the leadership culture and reinforcing its commitment 
towards maintaining effective risk management and 
internal control, and its responsibility towards the 
governance of risk and all the actions of the Board 
Committees with regards to the execution of delegated 
oversight responsibilities, in order to safeguard 
shareholders’	investments	and	the	Group’s	assets.  
As such, a governance structure has been established 
by the Board to ensure the effective stewardship of  
risk management and internal control within the  
Group at all levels. This includes fraud risk, corruption  
risk and climate-related risks and opportunities.  
The Board is assisted by the Audit Committee (“AC ”),  
which is empowered by its terms of reference to ensure 
independent oversight of internal control and risk 
management. 
Due to inherent limitations in any system of internal  
control and risk management, the Board recognises  
that the Group’s risk management framework and  
internal control system are designed to manage or  
mitigate, rather than eliminate, risks that may hinder the 
Group from achieving its goals and business objectives. 
Hence, the system provides reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against any occurrence of material 
misstatement,	loss	or	fraud. 
MAnAGEMEnt RESPOnSIBIlItY 
The Management assists the Board in the 
implementation of the Group’s policies and  
procedures on risk management and internal control 
by identifying, evaluating, measuring, monitoring 
and	reporting	 risks	 as	 well	 as	 any	 deficiencies	 and	 
non-compliance, with timely and proper remedial  
actions taken as and when required.
Management’s responsibilities in relation to risk 
management and internal control are:
Implementing and executing  
Board-approved policies;
Assuring effective implementation of the risk 
management framework and internal control system 
through design, implementation and monitoring; 
Identifying and assessing risks that are pertinent to 
the Group’s business objectives and strategies;
Developing policies and processes to  
manage risks in accordance with the  
Group’s strategic vision and overall risk appetite;
Executing corrective measures to rectify  
compliance	deficiencies	as	directed	 
by the Board; and
Promptly apprising the Board of any changes  
to risks and the corresponding remedial  
actions undertaken.

 Risk Management Framework 
 The Group’s Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) 
framework, which is incorporated into the Risk 
Management Policy and Guidelines approved by 
the Board, provides a structured and consistent 
approach to risk management across the Group.  
The ERM framework facilitates effective and 
continuous	identification,	assessment,	management,	
monitoring and reporting of these risks to  
provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
achievement of the Group business objectives. 
The framework is subject to continuous review and 
improvement, in response to changes in the risk 
profiles	while	remaining	aligned	with	the	Group’s	
overall	business	strategy. 
 Risks are categorised according to strategic, 
operational,	financial	and	compliance	matters	based	
on the Group’s business objectives. Fraud Risk 
Management (“FRM”) has also been embedded 
progressively	into	the	framework.  
 The Group’s risk management framework, 
benchmarked against the ISO 31000:2018 Risk 
Management – Guidelines, is customised to suit 
the Group’s business and operating environment, 
embedding both ERM and FRM into key activities, 
initiatives	and	processes	of	the	Group.  
 The ERM framework adopted by the Group consists 
of	 five	 elements	 as	 detailed	 below.	 It	 has	 been	
structured by aligning to the strategy, processes, 
people, technology and knowledge with the 
purpose of evaluating and managing risks, thereby 
creating	value	for	the	Group. 
 The risk organisational structure of the Group is 
illustrated in Diagram below:
ERM Framework Element Description 
Risk Governance  Establish an approach to develop, support and embed risk strategy and 
accountability.
Risk Assessment Identify and analyse risks (including fraud risk) across the Group.
Control Activities Develop	and	deploy	control	activities	to	mitigate	the	risk	identified. 
Information & Communication Continuous communication to obtain information to support risk 
management. 
Monitoring Activities Report, monitor and conduct activities to provide insight on risk  
management	strengths	and	weaknesses.

---- Page 105 ----
 The Risk Management Committee (“RMC”)  oversees 
risk management matters within the Group.  
The Committee is responsible for the effectiveness 
and adequacy of the Group’s risk management 
system, framework, policy, risks and controls 
associated with the Group’s operations and 
compliance	with	applicable	laws	and	regulations. 
 Members of the RMC constitute senior management 
from	all	 business	 units	 and	 relevant	 Head	 Office	
support units. The RMC is chaired by the Chief 
Financial	Officer	who	reports	to	the	AC	on	behalf	
of the RMC. A risk coordinator assists the RMC  
by acting as the focal point for all risk management 
activities	within	the	Group. 
 RMC meetings are held on a quarterly basis and  
their meeting minutes presented at the AC’s 
quarterly	meetings	for	comments	and	clarifications.	
The RMC also reports the Group’s aggregated risk 
position	and	significant	risk	issues	to	the	AC	on	a	
half-yearly basis.
  	 Day-to-day	 risk	 management	 responsibilities	 
reside with the respective business units and 
support units, where action plans are developed  
and implemented to manage and mitigate risks.
 Risk Management Process 
 The risk management framework establishes the 
context of risk in relation to the Group’s business  
and	 sets	 out	 the	 process	 for	 risk	 identification,	
assessment and management with continuous 
monitoring, review and communication. A risk 
template	capturing	 all	 key	 risks	 identified	 with	
detailed assessments and respective mitigating 
controls to be implemented, or already implemented, 
is reviewed by the heads of business units and 
support	units,	to	manage	these	risks. 
 All key risks are consolidated and presented for 
deliberation at quarterly RMC meetings where 
significant	risk	management	matters	discussed	are	
recorded in the minutes of meeting. These minutes 
are shared with the AC every quarter, enabling 
members	of	the	AC	to	discuss	and	seek	clarification	
on	risk	management	matters	on	a	timely	basis. 
	 Key	 findings	 on	 significant	 risk	 issues	 and	 the	
activities of the RMC are presented to the AC at  
least	twice	a	year. 
 Risk Appetite and tolerance 
 The appropriate risk appetite and corresponding 
risk parameters of the Group and its joint ventures 
are established by the Board via the RMC. Integral 
to the ERM framework, risk appetite sets the tone 
for risk taking in general and provides direction in 
assessing whether the Group is operating within 
acceptable	limits	in	achieving	its	strategic	objectives. 
	 Defined	 risk	 parameters,	 aligned	 to	 the	 Group’s	 
risk appetite, provide a guide for consistent 
evaluation of risks and prioritise risk mitigation 
actions.	 Both	 financial	 and	 non-financial	 risk	
parameters are reviewed by the Management 
and RMC as the need arises, ensuring that the 
risk	parameters	reflect	changes	in	risk	appetite	or	
circumstances in a fair and timely manner.
II kEY RISkS 
	 Risk	 identification	and	assessments	are	conducted	
on an ongoing basis for existing, new and 
emerging	risks	to	evaluate	their	impact	on	financial	
performance and operations across the Group.  
The management of our key risks can be found on 
“Our Key Risks and Impacts” on page 42. 
III IntERnAl COntROl 
 The Group has established a system of internal 
control that provides effective governance and 
oversight of internal control, comprising a set of 
mechanisms	and	 processes	 for	 the	 identification,	
assessment and management of key risks faced  
by the Group. The system of internal control is 
reviewed and updated when there are changes  
to the business environment and/or regulatory 
guidelines, while the processes are tested 
periodically to ensure the effectiveness and 
efficiency	of	internal	control	procedures.  
 These structured processes have been in place  
for	 the	 financial	 year	 ended	 31	 October	 2023	
and up to the date of approval of this Statement  
on Risk Management and Internal Control.  
The key elements of the Group’s system of internal 
control are:
 Board Committees 
 The Board discharges its duties with the 
assistance of several board committees, namely 
the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee, 
Remuneration Committee, Investment Committee 
and Whistleblowing Committee. These board 
committees are governed by their respective terms 
of	reference	which	outline	specific	duties	to	review	
and consider all matters within their scope of 
responsibility. 
 Associate-controlled entities and jointly-controlled 
businesses over which the Group does not have 
complete management authority are exempted 
from the Group’s internal control system. Board 
representation in these entities ensures that the 
Group’s interests are safeguarded.

GOVERNANCE

---- Page 106 ----
 Governance and Reporting Structure 
 The formal organisational structure of the Group 
clearly	 defines	 the	 lines	 of	 reporting	 and	 the	
accountabilities and responsibilities of respective 
functions within the Group. In addition, the Board 
and its various board committees are governed by 
well-defined	terms	of	reference. 
  Policies and Procedures 
 Elements of internal control have been embedded 
and documented in the form of policies and 
operating procedures of the Group which are 
continually	reviewed	 and	 updated	 to	 reflect	
changes in the business environment. Accountability 
and responsibility for key processes have been 
established	in	standard	operating	procedures. 
  Code of Conduct and Business Ethics 
 On 2 May 2014, the Group issued a Code of  
Conduct and Business Ethics (“CCBE”) for 
employees and business representatives such as 
vendors,	 suppliers	 and	 contractors,	 to	 reflect	 the	
Group’s commitment to a strong culture of integrity 
and ethical values. The CCBE, last updated on  
17 March 2020, is reviewed as and when necessary 
to remain relevant in addressing any ethical issues 
that	may	arise	within	the	organisation. 
 All employees are required to acknowledge that 
they have read and understood the CCBE upon 
commencement of employment and subsequently 
on an annual basis. The directors’ Code of Conduct 
and Ethics (“CCE”) is embedded into the Board 
Charter,	 with	 its	 first	 adoption	 of	 CCE	 in	 2014.	 
Both the Board Charter and the CCE were last 
updated	on	26	October	2023.	CCE	is	reviewed	as	
and when necessary to maintain its relevance.
 Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy 
 The Group adopts a zero-tolerance approach 
to bribery and corruption in all its forms and is  
committed to conducting business with the highest 
standards of ethics and integrity. The Group 
established its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Policy (“ABC policy”) on 9 March 2020 which  
prohibits all forms of bribery and corrupt 
practices, in line with Section 17A of the Malaysian  
Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009. The Policy 
was	last	updated	on	23	March	2023  with	further	
refinement.
 The Group has made it mandatory for all employees 
to read the ABC Policy and to take an annual online 
assessment test to gauge their understanding 
of the subject. In addition, all business partners 
including consultants and contractors are required 
to acknowledge and comply with the Policy.  
For more information, please refer to page 54 within 
the	Sustainability	Statement.  
 Whistleblowing Policy 
 The Group established a Whistleblowing Policy  
which outlines the Group’s commitment to allow, 
support and encourage employees and other 
stakeholders to raise concerns in a responsible, 
transparent	and	 confidential	 manner	 without	
being subject to victimisation or discriminatory 
treatment. These concerns entail any wrongdoings, 
malpractices or illegal activities within the Group. 
The	policy	was	last	revised	on	22	June	2023.  
 A Whistleblowing Committee comprising three 
independent non-executive directors is prepared  
to investigate any suspected misconduct, 
improprieties	or	 breaches	 related	 to	 financial	
reporting, compliance or violations of the Group’s 
CCBE and ABC Policy as well as protect those  
who	step	forward	to	report	such	activities. 
 A periodic educational newsletter titled ‘Integrity 
Observer’ on the themes of integrity, anti-bribery 
and anti-corruption is circulated among employees, 
serving as a reminder or refresher to employees  
on the Do’s and Don’ts, and the matters that should 
be	reported	to	the	WC	and/or	the	Integrity	Team.  
 Group Performance Review 
 Senior management meetings are conducted 
quarterly	to	discuss	financial	performance,	business	
development, operational and corporate matters  
of the Group. In addition, comprehensive  
information	on	the	Group’s	financial	performance,	
achievement of KPIs and progress of key projects 
are presented by Senior Management to the  
Board on a quarterly basis for an open and 
transparent	communication	and	update. 
 limits of Authority 
 The Group has established the Limits of Authority 
(“LoA”)	 to	 provide	 a	 well-defined	 framework	 
of authority and accountability assigned and 
delegated to each approving authority within the 
organisation. The LOA is reviewed periodically  
and	updated	to	reflect	changes	in	the	organisation. 
  Financial Budgeting 
 The Group manages the performance of its  
business units by establishing annual business plans 
and	budgets	at	the	start	of	each	financial	year	to	
track and assess actual performance against the  
set targets. These annual business plans and  
budgets are prepared by Senior Management and 
approved	by	the	Board.

strategies to attract skilled, competent and right 
talents to join the Group. Continuous on-the-job 
trainings and talent development programmes  
are conducted to ensure the employees are 
adequately	trained	and	fit	to	carry	out	their	duties	 
and responsibilities. Annual performance appraisal 
is in place to ensure employees meet the set 
expectation and maintain high competency and 
capability levels, while at the same time get  
rewarded accordingly.  
 Workplace safety and health 
 The Group is committed towards the well-being 
of its workforce by upholding high standards of 
occupational safety and health at construction sites 
and all business premises. 
 Periodic health and safety audits are performed, 
including checks on contractors to enforce 
for compliance of safety regulations on-site.  
Any	hazards	arising	are	identified	at	an	early	stage	
and appropriate measures are taken to reduce 
these dangers and minimise safety incidents at  
the	workplace.  
	 The	 Group	upholds	well-defined	health	and	safety	
policies and procedures, and constantly raises 
awareness on health and safety through training 
initiatives. 
 Regular building maintenance and physical 
checks on Group facilities are also performed at all 
offices	and	sales	galleries	to	ensure	the	safety	of	 
employees and visitors. For more information,  
please	 refer	 to	 pages	 44	 and	 63	 within	 the	
Sustainability	Statement.  
 	 Information Technology Management and  
Cyber Security 
 Comprehensive management information systems 
are in place to enable the Management to make 
business decisions in an accurate and timely 
manner via data capturing, compilation, analysis  
and	reporting	of	relevant	data	across	the	Group. 
 The Group runs a team of Information Technology 
(“IT”) professionals comprising in-house and 
outsourced specialists who implement IT security 
policies and procedures based on relevant data 
security standards and industry-recommended 
practices. Independent, external assessments 
are conducted semi-annually to ensure that the 
IT systems are robust, effective and continuously 
improved	to	reinforce	the	Group’s	cyber	resilience.  
 
 Software and human lines of defence are  
deployed against ever-evolving cyber threats and 
challenges. Layers of new controls are regularly 
enforced and proactively monitored to protect 
the Group’s critical business systems. Employee 
awareness of IT risks and cyber security are 
also	essential,	 so	 regular	 educational	 briefings,	
awareness emails, roadshows and phishing tests  
are held to ensure employees continue to stay 
vigilant	of	cyber	threats. 
 Another element of systems control is the  
Group-wide digital transformation programme 
which aims to minimise the risks from human 
intervention	and	improve	process	efficiency	through	
wider use of system automation. Group services 
and businesses will be digitalised by replacing  
non-digital processes and older digital technology 
with	new	digital	technology. 
 Investor Relations 
	 The	 Group	 conducts	 quarterly	 results	 briefings	
following	 the	 release	 of	 Group	 financial	 results,	 
and holds regular meetings to provide corporate 
updates	 for	 the	 investment	 and	 financial	 
communities. These meetings provide an  
opportunity for fund managers, investment analysts 
and	bankers	 to	 seek	 clarification	 from	 Senior	
Management. 
 Sustainability and ESG 
 The Group’s Sustainability Committee (“sC”) was 
established in 2017 to assist the Board in the 
implementation of the Group’s sustainability goals 
and initiatives. It is chaired by the Chief Executive 
Officer	and	 comprises	 key	 senior	 management	 
across all disciplines, regions of operation and 
support functions. The Board is the ultimate 
authority over the Group’s sustainability strategy 
and governance, reviewing and approving all 
sustainability-related	policies	and	initiatives. 
 An independent non-executive director is a  
member of the SC to provide sustainability insights, 
both from a governance standpoint and the 
perspective of external stakeholders, to enhance  
the	Board’s	oversight	of	sustainability	matters.  
 The SC reports to the Board on a half-yearly basis in 
relation to the Group’s sustainability initiatives and 
the holistic approach taken to identify and manage 
material sustainability matters that constitute the 
Group’s ESG risks and opportunities. For more 
information,	 please	 refer	 to	 page	 46	 within	 the	
Sustainability Statement and the Sustainability 
Report 2023 which can be downloaded from the 
Group’s	corporate	website.

VI REVIEW BY ThE BoARD
 After considering the assurances of the Chief 
Executive	 Officer	 and	 Chief	 Financial	 Officer,	 
the Board is of the opinion that the risk 
management processes and system of internal 
control are adequate and sound to provide 
reasonable assurance to protect and safeguard the  
shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets. 
This includes addressing key risks impacting the 
Group	for	 the	 financial	 year	 under	 review	 and	
through the date of approval of this Statement  
on	Risk	Management	and	Internal	Control. 
	 During	 the	 financial	 year,	 no	 major	 internal	 
control	issue	was	identified	that	may	result	in	any	
material loss or uncertainty that would require 
disclosure	in	this	Annual	Report. 
 All major risks affecting the Group will be 
continuously monitored with necessary measures 
taken to mitigate them. The Group’s risk  
management and system of internal control will be 
constantly reviewed and strengthened to ensure 
its adequacy and effectiveness in safeguarding 
shareholders’	investments	and	the	Group’s	assets.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the directors took reasonable 
steps to ascertain that action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance  
for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that there were no known bad debts and that adequate allowance had 
been made for doubtful debts.
At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances which would render it necessary to write  
off any bad debts or render the amount of allowance for doubtful debts in the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company inadequate to any substantial extent.
CURRENT ASSETS
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the directors took reasonable  
steps to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including 
their values as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an  
amount which they might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances which would render the values attributed  
to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
VALUATION METHODS
At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances which have arisen which render adherence 
to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate.
CONTINGENT AND OTHER LIABILITIES
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(i) any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year  
which secures the liabilities of any other person; and
(ii) any contingent liabilities in respect of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the  
financial year.
In the opinion of the directors, no contingent or other liability of the Group or of the Company has become  
enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable, within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year 
which will or may affect the ability of the Group or of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.
CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report  
or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the  
financial statements misleading.
ITEMS OF A MATERIAL AND UNUSUAL NATURE
In the opinion of the directors,
(i) the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the financial year were not substantially  
affected by any item, transaction and event of a material and unusual nature; and
(ii) no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen in the interval between the end of  
the financial year and the date of this report which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of  
the Group and of the Company for the financial year in which this report is made.

NOTES TO THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.3 New MFRS and amendments/improvements to MFRSs that have been issued, but are yet to be 
effective (Continued)
2.3.1 The Group and the Company plan to adopt the above applicable new MFRS and amendments/
improvements to MFRSs when they become effective. A brief discussion on the above significant 
amendments/improvements to MFRSs that may be applicable to the Group and the Company are 
summarised below.
 Amendments to MFRS 16 Leases
 The amendments clarify how an entity should subsequently measure the leaseback liability that  
arise in a sale and leaseback transaction. Although MFRS 16 includes requirements on how to 
account for a sale and leaseback at the date the transaction takes place, it has not specified how to 
measure the sale and leaseback transaction when reporting after that date.
 The amendments add subsequent measurement requirements for the right-of-use assets and lease 
liability arising from a sale and leaseback transaction by clarifying that a seller-lessee in a sale and 
leaseback transaction shall apply paragraphs 29 to 35 to the right-of-use asset arising from the 
leaseback and paragraphs 36 to 46 to the lease liability arising from the leaseback. The amendments 
will not change the accounting for leases other than those arising in a sale and leaseback transaction.
 Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements
 The amendments include specifying that an entity’s right to defer settlement of a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period must have substance and must exist at the end of 
the reporting period; clarifying that classification of liability is unaffected by the likelihood of the  
entity to exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period; clarifying how lending conditions affect classification of a liability; and clarifying 
requirements for classifying liabilities an entity will or may settle by issuing its own equity instruments. 
 In another amendment, an entity is required to disclose its material accounting policy information 
rather than significant accounting policies. The amendments, amongst others, also include  
examples of circumstances in which an entity is likely to consider an accounting policy information 
to be material to its financial statements. To support this amendment, MFRS Practice Statement 2 
was also amended to provide guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting 
policy information disclosures. The guidance and examples provided in the MFRS Practice 
Statement 2 highlight the need to focus on entity-specific information and demonstrate how the 
four-step materiality process can address standardised (or boilerplate) information and duplication 
of requirements of MFRSs in the accounting policy information disclosures. 
 The latest amendments to MFRS 101 clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply  
within 12 months after the reporting period affect the classification of a liability. As such,  
the amendments specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect 
the classification of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date. Instead, the amendments 
require an entity to disclose information about these covenants in the notes to the financial statements.
 Amendments to MFRS 121 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
 The amendments respond to stakeholder feedback and concerns about diversity in practice in 
accounting for a lack of exchangeability between currencies. 
 Applying the amendments, entities will be applying a consistent approach in determining if a 
currency can be exchanged into another currency. These amendments provide guidance on the spot 
exchange rate to use when a currency is not exchangeable into another currency and the disclosures 
entities need to provide to enable users of financial statements to understand the impact on the 
entities’ financial performance, financial position and cash flows as a result of a currency being not 
exchangeable into another currency.
 Except for the requirement to disclose material accounting policy information as required by 
the amendments to MFRS 101, the initial application of the above applicable new MFRS and 
amendments/improvements to MFRSs is not expected to have material impact to the current and 
prior years financial statements of the Group and of the Company.

2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)
2.4 Functional and presentation currency
 The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of  
the primary economic environment in which they operate (“the functional currency”). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”), which is also the Company’s functional 
currency, and has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated. 
2.5 Basis of measurement
 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except as otherwise disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements. 
2.6 Use of estimates and judgement
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRSs requires the use of certain critical 
accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during the financial year. It also requires the Group and the Company 
to exercise judgement in the process of applying their accounting policies. Although these estimates  
and judgements are based on the Group’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results 
may differ.
 The areas where assumptions and major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting 
period that have significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  
and liabilities within the next financial year, or areas involving judgements that have most effect on the 
amounts recognised in the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 Unless otherwise stated, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all financial years 
presented in these financial statements of the Group and of the Company.
3.1 Basis of consolidation and economic entities
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its  
subsidiaries. The financial statements of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same financial year as 
the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar 
circumstances.
(a)  Subsidiaries and business combinations
 Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entities and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entities. 
 The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from 
the date the Group obtains control until the date the Group loses control of the subsidiaries. 
 The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations from the  
acquisition date.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.1 Basis of consolidation and economic entities (Continued)
(a)  Subsidiaries and business combinations (Continued)
 For a new acquisition, goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the following:
•  the fair value of the consideration transferred, calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair 
value of assets transferred (including contingent consideration), the liabilities incurred to former 
owners of the acquiree and the equity instruments issued by the Group. Any amount that relates 
to pre-existing relationships or other arrangements before or during the negotiations for the 
business combination, that is not part of the exchange for the acquiree, will be excluded from the 
business combination accounting and be accounted for separately; plus
• the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at  
the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date (the choice 
of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis); plus
• if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the previously 
held equity interest in the acquiree; 
over
• the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities (including contingent 
liabilities) assumed at the acquisition date. 
 When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss at 
the acquisition date.
 Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the 
Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
 If the business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures the previously held  
equity interest in the acquiree to its acquisition-date fair value, and recognises the resulting gain or 
loss, if any, in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition 
date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit 
or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings on the same basis as would be required if the 
acquirer had disposed of the previously held equity interest.
 If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting  
period in which the business combination occurs, the Group uses provisional fair value amounts for 
the items for which the accounting is incomplete. The provisional amounts are adjusted to reflect 
new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, 
including additional assets or liabilities identified in the measurement period. The measurement 
period for completion of the initial accounting ends as soon as the Group receives the information 
it was seeking or learns that more information is not obtainable, subject to the measurement period 
not exceeding one year from the acquisition date.
 Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of  
the former subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to 
the former subsidiary. Any gain or loss arising from the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. 
 If the Group retains any interest in the former subsidiary, such interest is measured at fair value at  
the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an associate, a joint venture or a 
financial asset. 
 Changes in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control  
are accounted for as equity transactions. The difference between the Group’s share of net assets 
before and after the change, and the fair value of the consideration received or paid, is recognised 
directly in equity.

(b) Associates and joint ventures
 Associates are entities, including unincorporated entities, in which the Group has significant  
influence, but not control, over financial and operating policies. 
 Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the  
arrangements have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually 
agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, where decisions about the activities undertaken by  
the joint venture require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
 Associates or joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using  
the equity method unless it is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is 
classified as held for sale). 
 Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised  
at cost. Thereafter, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit  
or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, after adjustments to  
align its accounting policies with those of the Group.
 Goodwill relating to an associate or a joint venture is added to the carrying amount of the investment. 
 Any excess of the Group’s share of the fair value of the associate’s or joint venture’s identifiable  
net assets over the cost of the investment is not deducted from the carrying amount of investment 
and is instead recognised as income in the determination of the Group’s share of the associate’s or 
joint venture’s profit or loss for the period in which the investment is acquired. 
 When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate or a joint venture, the carrying 
amount of that interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued  
except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation or has made payments on 
behalf of the investee. 
 Should the associate or joint venture subsequently report profits, the Group only resumes the 
recognition of its share of such profits after it equals the share of losses previously not recognised.
 After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise 
an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associates or joint ventures.  
The Group determines at the end of each financial year whether there is any objective evidence 
that its investment in each associate and joint venture has been impaired. If this is the case,  
the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount  
of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.  
Any reversal of impairment is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the recoverable amount 
of the investment subsequently increases. 
 Investments in associates or joint ventures are stated in the Company’s statement of financial  
position at cost less impairment losses, unless the investment is classified as held for sale (or included 
in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale).
 The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment  
ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, or when the investment is classified as held for sale. 
When the Group retains an interest in a former associate or joint venture and the retained interest is 
a financial asset, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair value 
is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition in accordance with MFRS 9. 
 The difference between the carrying amount of an associate or a joint venture at the date the  
equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from 
disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture is included in the determination of the 
gain or loss on disposal of the associate or joint venture.

(b) Associates and joint ventures (Continued)
 When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture but continues to  
use the equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss  
that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income.
(c) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
 Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from  
intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
 When the Group transacts with an associate or a joint venture, profits and losses resulting from  
these transactions are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent 
of the interests in the associate or joint venture that are not related to the Group. 
 The unrealised profits on transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent that there is no evidence  
of impairment.
3.2 Foreign currency transactions and operations 
(a) Translation of foreign currency transactions 
 Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currencies of the  
Group entities at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
 At the end of each reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are  
retranslated at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. 
 Foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary items are  
recognised in profit or loss except for monetary items that are designated as hedging instruments in 
either a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation. 
 When settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, exchange differences are recognised in profit or 
loss in the separate financial statements of the parent company or the individual financial statements 
of the foreign operation. In the consolidated financial statements, the exchange differences are 
considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised initially in 
other comprehensive income until its disposal, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassified 
to profit or loss.
(b) Translation of foreign operations 
 In the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities of foreign operations denominated 
in a functional currency other than the presentation currency are translated into the presentation 
currency at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated 
at exchange rates ruling at the transaction dates.
 Exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. If the 
foreign operation is not a wholly-owned subsidiary, the relevant share of the translation difference is 
allocated to non-controlling interests.
 When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is 
lost, the realised cumulative foreign exchange translation reserve related to that foreign operation is 
reclassified to profit or loss.

 For a partial disposal not involving loss of control of a subsidiary, the relevant share of the  
cumulative foreign exchange translation reserve is reattributed to non-controlling interests. 
 For partial disposals of associates or joint ventures that do not result in the Group losing  
significant influence or joint control, the realised cumulative foreign exchange translation reserve is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
3.3 Financial instruments
 Financial instruments are recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when,  
the Group and the Company become a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
(a) Initial recognition
 Except for the trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, financial 
instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or 
financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. 
 Transaction costs attributable to a financial asset or financial liability carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. 
 Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or where the Group  
expects the period between when the promised goods are transferred and when the customer pays 
will be one year or less are measured at the transaction price determined under MFRS 15.
(b) Subsequent measurement
 The Group and the Company categorise the financial instruments as follows:
(i) Financial assets
 The financial assets are classified in the following categories:
(a) Amortised cost
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets consist of debt instruments that are  
held for collection of contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent solely  
payments of principal and interest. These financial assets are measured at amortised cost. 
 Accordingly, the Group and the Company classify the financial assets as financial assets 
measured at amortised cost.
 Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective  
interest method and are subject to impairment.
 The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment is in accordance with  
Note 3.10 to the financial statements. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss 
when the financial asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
(b) Fair value through profit or loss (“FVPL”)
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets consist of financial assets designated 
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.
 Accordingly, the Group and the Company classify the financial assets as FVPL.
 Financial assets at FVPL are carried in the statements of financial position at fair value with 
net changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

3.3 Financial instruments (Continued)
(b) Subsequent measurement (Continued)
 The Group and the Company categorise the financial instruments as follows: (Continued)
(ii) Financial liabilities
 The Group classifies its financial liabilities as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
 Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest  
rate (“EIR”) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the financial  
liabilities are derecognised and through the EIR amortisation process.
(c) Financial guarantee contracts 
 A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments  
to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when 
due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
 Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, net of transaction  
costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. 
 Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of the  
loss allowance determined using the general 3-stage approach as described in Note 3.10(a)(i)  
to the financial statements and the amount initially recognised, and where appropriate, 
the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15.
(d) Derecognition 
 A financial asset or a part of it is derecognised when, and only when: 
(i) the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset expire, or
(ii) the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party and 
either:
(a)  the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or 
(b)  the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of  
the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 
 On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount (measured at  
the date of derecognition) and the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less  
any new liability assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.
 A financial liability or a part of it is derecognised when, and only when, the obligation specified in  
the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. On derecognition of a financial liability,  
the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid, including any non-cash 
assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.
(e) Offsetting of financial instruments
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statements  
of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts 
and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
 In accounting for a transfer of a financial asset that does not qualify for derecognition, the entity  
shall not offset the transferred asset and the associated liability.

3.4 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
(a) Recognition and measurement
 Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment 
losses is set out in Note 3.10(b) to the financial statements.
 Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any  
other costs that are directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended 
use, as well as any costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which 
they are located. The cost of self-constructed assets also includes cost of materials, direct labour,  
and any other direct attributable costs but excludes internal profits. For qualifying assets, borrowing 
costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowing costs in Note 3.16 to  
the financial statements.
 Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as  
part of that equipment. 
 When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,  
they are accounted for as a separate item of property, plant and equipment.
(b) Subsequent costs
 The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
the future economic benefits associated with the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and 
maintenance are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
(c) Depreciation
 Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated.
 All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis by allocating  
their depreciable amounts over their remaining useful lives at the following rates:
 Buildings  2% - 13%
 Motor vehicles 16% - 20%
 Office equipment and fittings 10% - 33%
 Office renovation, site office equipment and communication equipment 10% - 20%
 The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of each  
financial year and adjusted as appropriate.
(d)  Derecognition
 An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future  
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition  
of the asset is recognised in profit or loss.
3.5 Leases
 At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is,  
or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period  
of time in exchange for consideration.

NOTES TO THE

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.5 Leases (Continued)
 (a) Lessee accounting
 At the lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability  
with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee.
 The Group presents right-of-use assets as part of the property, plant and equipment and  
lease liabilities in Notes 5 and 21, respectively, in the financial statements.
 The right-of-use asset is initially recognised at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease 
liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial 
direct costs incurred and an estimated cost to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentive 
received.
 The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from  
the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end 
of the lease term. If the Group expects to exercise a purchase option in a lease agreement, the right-
of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. 
 The annual depreciation rates of the Group’s right-of-use assets are as follows:
 Signboards 12%
 Motor vehicles 33%
 Buildings  16% - 80%
 The depreciation starts from the commencement date of the lease. In addition, the right-of-use asset 
is reduced by any impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.  
The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses is in accordance with  
Note 3.10 to the financial statements.
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid 
at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot  
be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments include fixed 
lease payments, less any lease incentives and any exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee  
is reasonably certain to exercise that option.
 The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in rate,  
or if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of lease term, or when a lease contract is modified and 
the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease. When the lease liability is remeasured 
in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset,  
or is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced  
to zero.
 The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and  
non-lease components as a single lease component.
 The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases 
and leases of low value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these 
leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(b) Lessor accounting 
 When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance  
lease or an operating lease. In determining the classification of each lease, the Group assesses 
whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the 
underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease. If not, then it is an operating 
lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is 
for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.5 Leases (Continued)
(b) Lessor accounting (Continued)
 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sub-lease as  
two separate contracts. The sub-lease is classified as a finance or an operating lease by reference to 
the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the 
Group applies the exemption described in Note 3.5(a) to the financial statements, then it classifies 
the sub-lease as an operating lease.
 If the Group is a lessor in a finance lease, it derecognises the underlying asset and recognises a  
lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Finance income is recognised 
in profit or loss based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net 
investment in the finance lease.
 If the Group is a lessor in an operating lease, the underlying asset is not derecognised but is 
presented in the statements of financial position according to the nature of the asset. Lease income 
from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies MFRS 15 to  
allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.
3.6 Investment properties
 Investment properties are properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both. 
Investment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as 
investment properties.
 Investment properties are initially measured at cost, which includes transaction costs. After the initial 
recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses.
 Investment properties are derecognised when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The gain or loss 
arising from the retirement or disposal of an investment property is determined as being the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit 
or loss in the period of retirement or disposal.
3.7 Inventories
 Inventories comprising properties held for sale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated 
costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
 Land held for property development
 Land held for property development consists of land where no significant development activities  
have been carried out or where development activities are not expected to be completed within the 
normal operating cycle. Cost includes cost of land and attributable development expenditures. 
 Land held for property development will be reclassified to properties under development when  
significant development work has been undertaken and is expected to be completed within the normal 
operating cycle.
 Property under development and completed properties 
 Property under development consists of the cost of land and all costs that are directly attributable  
to development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities, including 
common costs such as the cost of constructing mandatory infrastructure, amenities and affordable houses 
(net of estimated approved selling prices) and other related costs. 
 The cost of unsold completed properties is determined on a specific identification basis.

3.8 Contract assets/liabilities
 A contract asset is recognised for the excess of revenue recognised over progress billings and deposits  
or advances received from purchasers of properties. 
 When progress billings and deposits or advances received from purchasers of properties exceed  
revenue recognised, the Group recognises a contract liability for the difference.
 The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment losses on contract assets is in accordance 
with Note 3.10 to the financial statements.
3.9 Cash and cash equivalents  
 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank balances and deposits and other short-term, 
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
 For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of  
bank overdrafts and exclude deposits which have maturity of more than three months.
3.10 Impairment of assets
(a) Impairment of financial assets and contract assets
 Financial assets measured at amortised cost, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts are 
subject to the impairment requirement in MFRS 9 to account for expected credit losses. Expected 
credit loss (“ECL”) is the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a default 
occurring as the weights.
 The Group measures loss allowance as follows:
(i) General 3-stage approach
 At each reporting date, the Group measures loss allowance for other receivables and  
cash and bank balances at an amount equal to credit losses that result from default events that 
are possible within the next 12 months (“12-month ECL”) if credit risk on a financial instrument 
has not increased significantly since initial recognition. 
 For other financial instruments, a loss allowance at an amount equal to credit losses over the 
remaining life of the exposure (“lifetime ECL”) is required.
(ii) Simplified approach for trade receivables and contract assets
 The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by MFRS 9 to measure the loss  
allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL at each reporting date.
 When determining whether credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial 
recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information 
that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and 
qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit 
assessment and including forward-looking information. 
 Generally, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is 
more than 30 days past due.

(a) Impairment of financial assets and contract assets (Continued)
 The Group considers a financial asset to be in default (or credit-impaired) when contractual  
payment of the financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and 
supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. 
Nevertheless, in other cases, the Group may also consider internal and external information that 
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. Those information includes 
instances where:
• the counterparty is in significant financial difficulty;
• the counterparty is in breach of financial covenants;
• the lender of the counterparty having granted to the counterparty a concession that the lender 
would not otherwise consider; and
• it is becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial  
reorganisation.
 Impairment losses (or reversal) are recognised in profit or loss. 
 The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent 
that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines 
that the counterparty no longer have assets or a source of income that could generate sufficient  
cash flows to repay the amount owing.
(b) Impairment of non-financial assets
 The carrying amounts of non-financial assets (except for inventories, contract assets and deferred  
tax assets) are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. 
 If any such indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. 
 For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other non-financial assets or cash-generating units (“CGUs”). 
 The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. In determining the fair value less costs of disposal,  
recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified,  
an appropriate valuation model is used.
 Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of  
asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of a CGU or 
groups of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to those 
units or groups of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit or 
groups of units on a pro-rata basis.  
 Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss, except for assets that were previously revalued 
with the revaluation surplus recognised in other comprehensive income. In the latter case,  
the impairment is recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous 
revaluation.

3.10 Impairment of assets (Continued)
(b) Impairment of non-financial assets (Continued)
 An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. An impairment loss is 
reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. An impairment loss is reversed only to 
the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised 
previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is measured at revalued 
amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
3.11 Current versus non-current classification
 The Group classifies assets and liabilities in statements of financial position as current and non-current.  
An asset is classified as current when it is:
• expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in a normal operating cycle;
• held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• expected to be realised within twelve months after the financial year; or
• a cash or a cash equivalent which is not restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability  
for at least twelve months after the financial year.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is classified as current when:
• it is expected to be settled in a normal operating cycle;
• it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
• it is due to be settled within twelve months after the financial year; or
• there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after  
the financial year.
The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively.
3.12 Share capital
 Ordinary shares
 Ordinary shares are equity instruments and are classified as equity. An equity instrument is a contract  
that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. 
Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against 
equity. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are declared.

3.13 Employee benefits
(a) Short-term employee benefits
 Short-term employee benefit obligations in respect of wages, salaries, social security contributions, 
annual bonuses, paid annual leave, sick leave and non-monetary benefits are recognised as an 
expense in the financial year in which the employees have rendered their services to the Group.
(b) Defined contribution plans
 As required by law, the Group contributes to the Employees Provident Fund, the national 
defined contribution plan and the Central Provident Fund, Singapore’s defined contribution plan.  
Such contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss in the financial year in which the 
employees render their services.
3.14 Provisions
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of  
a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the  
obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
 Provisions are determined by discounting expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects  
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding 
of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
3.15 Revenue and other income 
(a) Revenue
 The Group recognises revenue that depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange 
for those goods or services. 
 Revenue recognition of the Group is applied based on each contract with a customer or on a 
combination of contracts with the same customer (or related parties of the customer). For practical 
expediency, the Group applies revenue recognition to a portfolio of contracts (or performance 
obligations) with similar characteristics in the property development business if the Group reasonably 
expects that the effects on the financial statements would not differ materially from recognising 
revenue on each individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. 
 The Group measures revenue from sale of good or service at its transaction price, being the amount 
of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised 
good or service to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf  of third parties such as goods 
and service tax, adjusted for the effects of any variable consideration, constraining estimates of 
variable consideration, significant financing components, non-cash consideration and consideration 
payable to customer.
 Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised by reference to each distinct performance 
obligation in the contract with customer, i.e. when or as a performance obligation in the contract with 
customer is satisfied. A performance obligation is satisfied when or as the customer obtains control 
of the good or service underlying the particular performance obligation, which the performance 
obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time.

(a) Revenue (Continued)
 Financing components 
 The Group has applied the practical expedient of not adjusting the promised amount of consideration 
for the effects of a significant financing components if the Group expects the period between the 
transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer to be one 
year or less.
(i) Property development
 The Group develops and sells lands, residential and commercial properties. 
 Contracts with customers may include multiple distinct promises to customers and these are 
accounted for as separate performance obligations. Where the stand-alone selling prices are 
not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margins.
 Revenue from the sales of properties under development is recognised as and when the 
control of the property is transferred to the customer. Based on the terms of the contract and 
applicable laws, control is transferred over time as the Group’s performance does not create an 
asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment 
for performance completed to-date. 
 Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of that performance obligation, which in turn is determined by the 
proportion that property development costs incurred for work performed to-date bear over 
the estimated total property development costs (an input method). 
 Revenue from the sale of completed properties is recognised at a point in time when control 
of the property is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group will collect the 
consideration to which it is entitled.
 Based on the Group’s customary business practice, the customers’ legal fees are borne by  
the Group. Revenue is recognised net of customers’ legal fees. 
 The Group determines that sales of properties under Help2Own scheme contain a significant 
financing component. Consequently, the amount of the promised consideration is adjusted 
for the time value of money and the related interest income is recognised using the effective 
interest method over the term of the deferment.
 The Group also determines that its sales of properties under Stay2Own scheme includes a 
variable amount. Revenue from these sales is recognised only to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will  
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently 
resolved.
 For residential properties and commercial properties, the Group’s obligations are to rectify 
any defects that become apparent within the relevant defect liability period. No provision for 
rectification costs has been made as at the end of the financial year, as there has been no  
known material defects reported and only minimal costs have been incurred in the past.
(ii) Management fees
 Management fees are recognised over time as services are rendered based on time elapsed. 
Credit term of the management fee billed is 30 days.

(iii) Sales of other goods
 Revenue from the sale of other goods is recognised at a point in time when control of the  
goods is transferred to the customer, being the time when the customer accepts the delivery 
of the goods.
 Revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of any discounts.
 Sales are made with a credit term ranging from 30 to 60 days, which is consistent with market 
practice and therefore, no element of financing is deemed present. A receivable is recognised 
when the customer accepts delivery of the goods. 
 Where consideration is collected from customer in advance for sale of good, a contract liability 
is recognised for the customer deposits. Contract liability would be recognised as revenue 
upon sale of good to the customer.
(iv) Dividend income
 Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
(b) Other income
(i) Interest income
 Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
(ii) Rental income
 Rental income, net of lease incentives granted, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease. 
3.16 Borrowing costs
 Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying 
assets are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
 Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying 
assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended 
use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time the assets are substantially ready for their 
intended use or sale.
 The Group begins capitalising borrowing costs when the Group has incurred the expenditures for the 
asset, incurred the borrowing costs and undertaken activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its 
intended use or sale.
 Income earned on the temporary investment of borrowed funds pending disbursement for expenditure  
on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

3.17 Income tax 
 Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in profit 
or loss except when it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other 
comprehensive income.
(a) Current tax
 Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the financial 
year, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the financial  
year, adjusted for any over or under recognised current tax expense in respect of previous 
financial years.
(b) Deferred tax
 Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position. 
 Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 
 Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax 
losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and unused tax credits, to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax 
losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and unused tax credits can be utilised. 
 Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of assets 
and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
 Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is 
able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments 
and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable 
profits to utilise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the 
foreseeable future. 
 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit 
of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
 Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the 
extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax assets to  
be utilised.
 Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
 Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or 
loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
 Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend 
to settle their income tax recoverable and income tax payable on a net basis or their tax assets and 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

(c) Goods and services tax (“GST”) and sales and service tax (“SST”)
 GST in Malaysia was abolished and replaced by SST on 1 September 2018.
 Revenue is stated net of any SST collected.
 GST or SST paid on goods and services purchased are recognised as part of the cost of purchase 
of such goods and services, unless the GST is recoverable from the tax authority, in which case the  
GST paid is recognised as a receivable.
3.18  Earnings per share
 The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) data for its ordinary shares. 
 Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year. 
 Diluted EPS is determined by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of any dilutive potential ordinary 
shares. 
3.19 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
 A contingent liability or contingent asset is a possible obligation or asset that arises from past events  
and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future 
event(s) not wholly within the control of the Group and of the Company. 
 Additionally, contingent liabilities include a present obligation that arises from past events where: 
(a) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to 
settle the obligation; or 
(b) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 
Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the statements of financial position.
3.20 Fair value measurements 
 The fair value of an asset or a liability, except for share-based payments and lease transactions,  
is determined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The measurement assumes 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in 
the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
 For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
3.20 Fair value measurements (Continued)
 When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far  
as possible. Fair value is categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input  
used in the valuation technique as follows:
Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group  
and the Company can access at the measurement date.
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3:  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the event or 
change in circumstances that caused the transfers.
3.21 Operating segments
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief 
operating decision maker. The Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the chief operating decision 
maker that makes strategic decisions.
3.22 Contract acquisition costs
 Contract acquisition costs are incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Contract 
acquisition costs are recognised as an asset when the Group expects that those costs are recoverable 
through property development revenue earned from the customer. 
 These costs are amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the 
properties to which the asset relates. 
 The Group has applied the practical expedient to recognise contract acquisition costs as an expense when 
incurred for contracts with an amortisation period of one year or less.
 Impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract 
acquisition costs asset exceeds the remaining consideration that the Group expects to receive for the 
specific contract that the costs relate to (after deducting additional costs required to be incurred in relation 
to the contracts).
4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 Significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have a 
significant effect in determining the amounts recognised in the financial statements include the following:
4.1  Impairment assessment of investment in joint ventures (Note 10 to the financial statements)
 The Group assesses its investment in joint ventures at the end of the reporting period for any objective 
evidence that the investment may be impaired as a result of one or more events that have occurred.  
Where there is objective evidence of impairment, the Group determines its share of the present value of  
the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the joint venture. In estimating the present 
value of the estimated cash flows, the Group applies a suitable discount rate and make assumptions 
underlying the cash flow projections such as future sales of development properties and future costs  
of development
 Cash flows projected based on those inputs or assumptions may have a significant effect on the Group’s 
and the Company’s financial positions and results if the actual cash flows are less than expected.

4.2 Capitalisation of borrowing costs (Note 7 to the financial statements)
 Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or development of qualifying inventories  
are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. The Group begins the capitalisation of borrowing  
costs when it has incurred the borrowing costs and continues to undertake activities that are necessary 
to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. When each phase of the development is ready for its 
intended sale, the Group ceases the capitalisation of the borrowing costs incurred on that phase.
 Significant judgement is required to determine whether the activities meet the criteria of an active 
development that benefits future development phases.
4.3 Recognition of property development revenue (Note 26 to the financial statements)
 The Group recognises property development revenue in profit or loss based on the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations. The progress towards complete satisfaction of 
performance obligations is determined by the proportion that property development costs incurred for 
work performed to-date bear over the estimated total property development costs. 
 In determining the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations, significant 
judgement is required in the estimation of property development costs incurred to-date, total property 
development revenue (including estimated variable consideration) and total development costs,  
as well as the recoverability of the development projects. The estimated total revenue and development 
costs are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events. In making this 
judgement, the Group relies on past experience and the work of specialists.
4.4 Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries (Note 8 to the financial statements)
 The Company assesses impairment of its investment in subsidiaries whenever the events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. Where such 
indication exists, the Company determines the recoverable amount based on present value of the estimated 
future cash flows expected to be generated by the subsidiaries. In estimating the present value of the 
estimated cash flows, the Company applies a suitable discount rate and make assumptions underlying the 
cash flow projections such as expected revenue from sales of properties.
 Cash flow projected based on those inputs or assumptions may have a significant effect on the Company’s 
financial positions and results if the actual cash flows are less than expected.

Fair value     54,527  54,527
The fair value of the freehold land is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy according to the criteria stated 
in Note 3.20 to the financial statements. The fair value has been derived using the sales comparison approach. 
Sales prices of comparable land in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property 
size. The most significant input into this valuation approach is the price per square foot of comparable land. 
The fair value has been determined from a valuation performed by a registered independent valuer having 
appropriate recognised professional qualification and experience in the location and category of the property 
being valued.
The investment property had been charged to secure banking facilities granted to the Group (Note 20 to the 
financial statements).

Less: Accumulated impairment losses     (452,063)  (358,513)
    3,089,225  3,183,225
Arising from an assessment of the underlying value of subsidiaries, the Company noted that the recoverable 
amount of a subsidiary was lower than its carrying amount in view of recent adverse conditions impacting  
the subsidiary. The recoverable amount of the investment was computed based on the Company’s estimated 
future cash flows expected to be generated by the subsidiary taking into consideration the expected revenue 
from sales of properties and development costs of the properties.
Accordingly, an impairment loss of RM94,000,000 (2022: RM185,000,000) was recognised in profit or loss.
During the financial year, the Company redeemed a portion of RCPS in a subsidiary amounting to RM450,000, 
which was previously impaired. Accordingly, the impairment loss was reversed. The redemption of RCPS did  
not alter the Company’s percentage ownership in the subsidiary.

 There were no dividends paid by the joint ventures during the financial year ended 31 October 2022.
 Review for impairment of EWI
 As at 31 October 2023 and 31 October 2022, the Group’s quoted investment in a joint venture, EWI, was 
assessed for impairment as the market value (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was less than its carrying amount.  
The recoverable amount of the investment was computed based on the Group’s share of the estimated future  
cash flows expected to be generated by EWI, taking into consideration the expected revenue from sales of 
properties and development costs of the properties. 
 Based on the assessment, an impairment loss of RM82,000,000 (2022: RM81,000,000) had been recognised  
in profit or loss during the financial year. The pre-tax discount rates used range from 9% to 14% (2022: 10%  
to 12%).
 Significant restrictions
 The joint ventures cannot distribute their profit unless approvals are obtained from the respective joint venture 
partners.

40. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
 The Group’s and the Company’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from their operations 
and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 
The Group’s and the Company’s overall financial risk management objective is to minimise potential adverse 
effects on the financial performance of the Group and of the Company.
 Financial risk management is carried out through risk review, internal control systems and adherence to the 
Group’s and the Company’s financial risk management policies. The Board regularly reviews these risks and 
approves the policies covering the management of these risks. The Group and the Company do not trade in 
derivative instruments.
(a)  Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and the Company that may arise on outstanding  
financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligations. The Group and the Company are 
exposed to credit risk from their operating activities (primarily trade receivables and financial guarantees) 
and from their investing activities, including deposits with banks and other financial instruments.
 The Group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is managed through the application of 
credit approvals for material contracts. If necessary, the Group may obtain collaterals from counter-parties 
as a means of mitigating losses in the event of default.
 As at the end of the financial year, the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk are 
represented by:
(i) the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position; 
and
(ii)  the corporate guarantees and undertakings provided by the Group and the Company to banks to 
secure:
• the borrowings of certain subsidiaries, joint ventures and the associate; and
• the repayment by certain joint ventures of monies due, owing, unpaid or outstanding to the other 
joint venture partners.
 The Group and the Company monitor the financial performance (including the timeliness of loan  
repayments) of the subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates on an on-going basis.
 The maximum credit risk that the Group and the Company are exposed to from corporate guarantees and 
undertakings provided amounted to:
     2023  2022  
    RM‘000 RM‘000
Group     2,712,420  3,010,572
Company    5,069,785  5,379,483
 The above represents the maximum amounts that the Group and the Company could be obliged to pay if 
the guarantees were called on.

NOTES TO THE  
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
40. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(a)  Credit risk (Continued)
 Generally, the Group and the Company consider the financial guarantees to be of low credit risk as  
the guarantees are provided as credit enhancement to the subsidiaries’, joint ventures’ and associates’ 
secured borrowings.
 As at the reporting date, there were no losses arising from the financial guarantees and undertakings 
provided by the Group and the Company.
 The fair value of the above financial guarantees has not been recognised since the fair value on initial 
recognition was not material.
 Trade receivables and contract assets
 As at the reporting date, the Group was not exposed to credit risk that is significantly concentrated on a 
single counterparty or groups of counterparties.
 The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECL prescribed by MFRS 9, which permits  
the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables and contract assets.
 To measure the ECL, trade receivables are grouped according to the number of days past due.  
The determination of ECL also incorporates economic conditions during the period, historical data,  
current conditions and forward-looking information on economic conditions over the expected settlement 
period of the receivables and contract assets. The Group believes that changes in economic conditions over 
the expected settlement periods would not materially impact the calculation of impairment of receivables 
and contract assets.
 The information about credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets is as  
follows:
     2023  2022  
    RM‘000 RM‘000
Group

40. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(a)  Credit risk (Continued)
 Other receivables and other financial assets
 For other receivables and other financial assets (including cash and cash equivalents and refundable 
deposits), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with counterparties  
with high credit rating.
 At the reporting date, the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk arising from  
other receivables and other financial assets are represented by the carrying amount of each class of  
financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position.
 The Group and the Company consider the probability of default upon the initial recognition of an 
asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout  
each reporting period. The Group and the Company assess whether there are any significant increase 
in credit risk. Such assessment includes assessing available reasonable and supportive forward-looking 
information of the counterparty and compare the risk of a default occurring as at the reporting date with the 
risk of default as at the date as initial recognition.
 The Group and the Company provide advances to joint ventures and subsidiaries. Certain advances  
to joint ventures and subsidiaries are repayable on demand. For such advances, expected credit losses 
are assessed based on the assumption that repayment of the advances is demanded at the reporting date.  
If the joint venture and subsidiary do not have sufficient liquid reserves when the loan is demanded,  
the Group and the Company will consider the expected manner of recovery and recovery period of the 
advances.
 Other than the credit-impaired amount due from subsidiaries, the Group and the Company consider these 
financial assets to be of low credit risk, for which no material loss allowance is required.
(b)  Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial  
obligations when they fall due. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arise primarily 
from mismatch in the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure 
to liquidity risk arise principally from trade and other payables, loans and borrowings.
 The Group’s and the Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding  
and flexibility through the use of stand-by facilities. The Group and the Company maintain sufficient  
liquidity and available funds to meet daily cash needs, while maintaining controls and security over cash 
movements.
 The Group and the Company use a set of processes to obtain maximum benefits from its flow of funds,  
such that they are efficiently managed to maximise income from investment and minimise cost on  
borrowed funds. The Group’s treasury/finance department ensures that there are sufficient unutilised  
stand-by facilities, funding and liquid assets available to meet both short-term and long-term funding 
requirements.

40. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)
(c) Interest rate risk
 Interest rate risk is the risk of fluctuation in fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and of the  
Company’s financial instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates.
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from their long-term loans and 
borrowings and bank overdrafts amounting to:
 Group  Company
  2023  2022  2023  2022   
  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000
Floating interest rate:
Loans and borrowings and bank overdrafts  993,045  1,757,550  340,000  645,000
 Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk
 At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 25 basis points lower/higher, with all other variables held 
constant, the Group’s and the Company’s profit net of tax and total equity would have been higher/lower by:
 Group  Company
  2023  2022  2023  2022   
  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000
Interest rate risk   1,153  1,994  646  1,225
 The assumed movement in basis points for this interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently 
observable market environment.
41. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
 The methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
(a) Cash and deposits, receivables and payables
 The carrying amounts of cash and deposits, current receivables and payables are reasonable  
approximation of fair values due to their short-term nature.
 The fair value of land acquisition liabilities classified as non-current liabilities is estimated by discounting 
future cash flows using lending rates for similar types of arrangements.
(b) Short-term funds
 Fair value of short-term funds is determined based on its quoted price.
(c)  Loans and borrowings (including bank overdrafts)
 The carrying amounts of the current portion of loans and borrowings are reasonable approximation of  
fair values due to the insignificant impact of discounting.
 The carrying amounts of long-term floating rate loans are reasonable approximation of fair values as the 
loans will be re-priced to market interest rate on or near reporting date.
 The fair value of fixed rate loans and borrowings are estimated by discounting future cash flows using 
lending rates for similar type of arrangements.

42.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 The primary objective of the Group’s and of the Company’s capital management policy is to ensure that they 
maintain a healthy capital ratio in order to support their businesses, enable future development and maximise 
shareholders’ value.
 The Company reviews and manages the capital structure of each group entity regularly and makes adjustments  
to address changes in the economic environment and risk characteristics inherent in their business operations. 
These initiatives may include equity capital raising exercises and adjustments to the amount of dividends 
distributed to shareholders.
 The Group and the Company monitor capital using the net gearing ratio of the Group, which is net debt  
divided by total equity attributable to owners of the Company. Net debt comprises loans and borrowings,  
hire purchase liabilities and bank overdrafts less short-term funds, and cash and deposits. This ratio is used  
to assess the appropriateness of the Group’s and of the Company’s debt levels.
 At the end of the financial year, the gearing ratios for the Group are as follows:
  Group
     2023  2022  
    RM’000  RM’000
Loans and borrowings (Note 20)     2,531,603  2,783,299

Total equity attributable to owners of the Company    4,773,527  4,738,471
Net gearing ratio     0.25  0.31
 The Company and certain subsidiaries are required to comply with debt equity ratios in respect of their term 
loans, bridging loans, Sukuk, medium term notes and revolving credit facilities. The Group has complied with 
these debt equity ratios.

AUDITORS’ REPORT  
TO THE mEmBERS OF ECO WORLD DEVELOPmENT GROuP BERHAD (Incorporated in malaysia)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Eco World Development Group Berhad, which comprise the 
statements of financial position as at 31 October 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of  
comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company 
for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies, as set 
out on pages 113 to 196.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the  
Group and of the Company as at 31 October 2023 and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the 
financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International  
Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, 
Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence 
Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the  
IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Group
Impairment assessment of investment in joint ventures (Note 4.1 and Note 10 to the financial statements)
The Group’s policy is to assess its investment in joint ventures at the end of the reporting period for any objective 
evidence that the investment may be impaired as a result of one or more events that have occurred. Where there is 
objective evidence of impairment, the Group determines its share of the present value of the estimated future cash 
flows expected to be generated by the joint venture. In estimating the present value of the estimated cash flows,  
the Group is to apply a suitable discount rate and make assumptions underlying the cash flow projections such as future 
sales of development properties and future costs of development.
The Group has performed an impairment assessment on an investment based on its share of the present value of  
the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the joint venture. During the financial year, an impairment 
loss of RM82,000,000 was recognised on investment in the joint venture.
We focused on this area because the Group’s determination of recoverable amount requires the exercise of  
significant judgement to be made by the Directors especially in determining the discount rates to be applied in the 
recoverable amount calculation and assumptions supporting the underlying cash flow projections.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Key Audit Matters (Continued)
Group (Continued)
Impairment assessment of investment in joint ventures (Note 4.1 and Note 10 to the financial statements) 
(Continued)
Our audit response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• discussing with the Group the appropriateness of the recoverable amount and the valuation methodology  
adopted by the Group;
• comparing the Group’s key assumptions against our understanding gathered from the review of component 
auditors’ work papers, discussion with component management and external data, if any; and
• testing the mathematical accuracy of the impairment assessment.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs (Note 4.2 and Note 7 to the financial statements)
The Group’s policy is to capitalise borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the development of qualifying 
inventories as part of the cost of those assets. The Group’s policy is to begin the capitalisation of borrowing costs  
when it has incurred the borrowing costs and continues to undertake activities that are necessary to prepare the asset 
for its intended use or sale.
We focus on this area because there is significant judgement required to be made by the Directors in the basis  
adopted in the capitalisation of borrowing costs.
Our audit response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• discussing with the Group the nature of any infrastructure, technical and administrative works that were carried out 
on future phases and sighting to relevant supporting documents, if any;
• reading selected loan agreements to note the purpose of loans; and
• checking the calculation of borrowing costs capitalised by reading the inputs used in the calculation such as interest 
rates and principal amounts.
Recognition of property development revenue (Note 4.3 and Note 26 to the financial statements)
The Group’s policy is to recognise property development revenue in profit or loss based on the progress towards 
complete satisfaction of performance obligations. The progress towards complete satisfaction of performance 
obligations is to be determined by the proportion that property development costs incurred for work performed 
to-date bear over the estimated total property development costs.
We focused on this area because significant judgement is required to be made by the Group, in particular with regards 
to determining the progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations, the extent of the property development 
costs incurred, the estimated total property development revenue (including estimated variable consideration)  
and costs, as well as the recoverability of the development projects. The estimated total revenue and costs are affected 
by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events.

Our audit response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• understanding the Group’s process in preparing or updating project budget and the calculation of the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations;
• comparing the Group’s major assumptions to contractual terms, our understanding gathered from the analysis of 
changes in the assumptions from previous financial year and discussing with project managers;
• discussing with the Group and understanding the estimates made by the Group in relation to delivery period of 
selected projects;
• discussing with the Group the reasonableness of computed progress towards complete satisfaction of  
performance obligations for identified projects against architect or consultant certificate; and
• checking the mathematical computation of revenue recognised for selected projects during the financial year.
Company
Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries (Note 4.4 and Note 8 to the financial statements)
The Company’s policy is to assess impairment of its investment in subsidiaries whenever the events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. Where such indication 
exists, the Company is to determine the recoverable amount based on present value of the estimated future cash 
flows expected to be generated by the subsidiaries. In estimating the present value of the estimated cash flows,  
the Company is to apply a suitable discount rate and make assumptions underlying the cash flow projections such as 
expected revenue from sales of properties.
During the financial year, an impairment loss on investment in a subsidiary of RM94,000,000 was recognised in  
profit or loss.
We focused on this area because the Company’s determination of indication of impairment and impairment  
assessment requires the exercise of significant judgement.
Our audit response:
Our audit procedures included, among others:
• discussing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology at recoverable amount as adopted by the Company;
• understanding the key assumptions used by the Company in relation to cash flow projection; and
• testing the mathematical accuracy of the impairment assessment.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  
information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and  
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to 
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears 
to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or 
the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors of the Company are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s internal control;
• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the directors;

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
(Continued)
• conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern;
• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to 
bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated 
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which 
we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 8 to the financial statements.
Other Matters
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the contents 
of this report.
