In anticipation of the Netherlands' transposition of 
the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) into national law, Shell has for the first time 
in this report included a Sustainability Statements 
section (pages 341-440), prepared on a voluntary 
basis in accordance with the CSRD and European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). 
The Sustainability Statements section forms an 
integral part of the management report. [A]
The CSRD requires certain European and non-European 
companies (including Shell plc due to its listing on Euronext 
Amsterdam) to make disclosures on environmental, social 
and governance topics in accordance with the ESRS. We 
have applied the structure proposed in the ESRS, adopted 
"incorporation by reference" and sought to integrate the 
disclosures in other sections of this report where appropriate 
and permitted. Section headers in the Sustainability Statements 
follow the structure of the ESRS. Terms and definitions used in 
the text are defined by Shell unless explicitly stated otherwise.
[A] The consolidated management report, as referenced in the CSRD, includes the 
strategic report and governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts.

---- Page 5 ----
In 2024, we continued to do what Shell does best, 
connecting energy and people.
In total, we served around 33 million customers at Shell-branded retail 
sites every day, and around 1 million business customers across more 
than 70 countries. We used the power of our people, brand, technology 
and trading network to provide our customers with the oil and gas they 
need today. At the same time, we increasingly helped them to make
low-carbon choices, from biofuels to charging for electric vehicles.
In this second year under our Chief Executive Officer, Wael Sawan, 
Shell went from strength to strength. We improved Shell's operational 
performance, and made good progress against the financial and 
climate targets and ambition we set out at our Capital Markets Day 
in 2023 and in our Energy Transition Strategy 2024.
We demonstrated that our strategy to deliver more value with less 
emissions is producing strong results, and compelling shareholder 
returns. By the beginning of 2025, we had announced $3 billion 
or more in buybacks for 13 consecutive quarters.
New projects
Shell has pioneered ways to provide energy for more than a century. 
As the energy system and energy mix keep evolving, we will continue 
to provide the energy people need through the complex transition to 
low-carbon energy.
We will help to keep the world moving with oil and gas, while 
developing the low-carbon alternatives our customers need to 
decarbonise. To that end, we have built on our leadership positions in 
[A] Based on a five-year average 2016–2020 for Brent Charlie emissions, and the highest 
expected emissions for Penguins.
liquefied natural gas (LNG) and deep-water oil and gas production with 
some important new projects. We announced a final investment decision 
for Manatee, an undeveloped gas field in Trinidad and Tobago, which 
will have a key role in providing gas to the country's Atlantic LNG facility. 
Our deep-water Whale platform in the Gulf of America started 
production in January 2025. At its peak, we expect that Whale will 
produce around 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, enough to fuel 
the daily journeys of 2.7 million cars in the USA. It will operate with 30% 
lower carbon intensity over its life cycle than Vito, another US deep-water 
platform. In February 2025, our next-generation Penguins facility started 
production in the North Sea. It will produce mostly oil but also enough 
gas to heat around 700,000 UK homes a year, with around 30% lower 
operational emissions than its predecessor, Brent Charlie [A].
Less emissions
We kept our focus on reducing emissions as we worked to become a 
net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. In 2024, we achieved our 
short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the products we 
sell, compared with 2016. We achieved this mainly by reducing sales 
of oil products and growing power sales.
By the end of 2024, we had achieved 60% of our target to halve 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared 
with 2016 levels. 
We continued to transform our business. In January 2024, we 
announced the decision to stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet 
fuel and diesel at the Wesseling site of our Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rheinland, Germany, and to produce premium oils instead. In April 
2024, we opened our bioLNG liquefaction plant in Germany, which 
can produce enough bioLNG to fuel around 5,000 LNG trucks a year.
Technology and innovation
Innovation remains vital for a successful transition to low-carbon 
energy. In 2024, we spent around $500 million on projects that 
contributed to decarbonisation, almost half of our total spending on 
research and development. In December, I saw some of that work for 
myself when I visited the Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam in the 
Netherlands. I was especially excited to see how our research is 
building on Shell's leadership in gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology, 
something we pioneered almost half a century ago.
Today, the Pearl GTL gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar uses natural gas to 
produce an alternative fuel to conventional diesel for transport, as well 
as oils and lubricants. We have also used GTL technology to develop 
immersion cooling fluids for data centres. These fluids reduce costs, 
energy consumption and emissions compared with conventional 
cooling. This will be increasingly important as the growth in artificial 
intelligence leads to greater use of energy-intensive data centres.
Now our scientists in Amsterdam are researching how to use that 
same GTL technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel made 
from renewable power and captured carbon on a commercial scale. 
In another exciting development for the energy transition, they are also

looking at how to produce synthetic methane, made from renewable 
hydrogen and captured carbon, to decarbonise the production of LNG.
We are creating the business case for other pioneering solutions, such 
as carbon capture and storage, which will be critical for the energy 
transition. In 2024, we took a final investment decision for two projects 
in Canada that will capture and store carbon from our Shell Energy 
and Chemicals Park Scotford in Alberta. These build on the success 
of our Quest CCS project in Canada which has captured more than 
9 million tonnes of CO₂ since 2015.
The Northern Lights joint venture with Equinor and TotalEnergies in 
Norway is developing the world's first project to offer commercial 
carbon transport and storage as a service. The first CO2 shipments 
are expected in 2025.
Unique capabilities
Our strengths go way beyond production. Through our integrated 
portfolio, we can buy and blend energy products to meet our customers' 
needs. We can use our unique capabilities, including trading, to connect 
energy to our customers through the energy transition.
For example, we became one of the world's largest traders and 
suppliers of sustainable aviation fuel in 2024. We achieved this 
because of our long-term agreements with producers, the strength 
of our customer relationships, and strategic investments in logistics 
around key terminals and airports.
In 2024, we continued to build an organisation with an outstanding 
brand, as well as outstanding people, and trading, technology and 
innovation capabilities. Today, we sell nearly three times the energy 
products that we produce, meeting our customers' demand for oil 
and gas and low-carbon products through our integrated model.
Working together
We believe that the energy transition will be achieved by governments, 
companies like Shell, and customers all working together. Governments 
need to put in place effective policies to progress the energy transition, 
and energy producers need to help develop the solutions of the future. 
The transition also requires demand from customers who are willing to 
pay for low-carbon energy. We are playing our part. I am confident 
that Shell can continue to bring its deep experience to help advance 
the energy transition.
In 2024, we demonstrated that you can still be sure of Shell. As a 
customer, you can be sure that Shell will provide you with the right 
products and solutions today and through the energy transition. And 
as an investor you can be sure that this is the right management team 
with the right strategy, setting Shell up for success in the years to come.

In 2024, the world experienced continued geopolitical 
volatility. The Russia-Ukraine war entered its third year 
and conflict escalated in the Middle East, bringing 
personal tragedy to many. It was a time of political 
change, with elections in more than 60 countries.
Energy security and affordability rose higher on political agendas, even 
as the share of renewable energy grew. This came into sharp focus 
during Europe's winter of 2024. Wind and solar power reached record 
levels in the region, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) played a critical 
role in keeping homes and businesses running when there was not 
enough wind or sunlight.
With global demand for energy increasing, coupled with the challenge 
of climate change, Shell continues to focus on its strategy to deliver 
more value with less emissions. We believe the world needs to 
maintain secure and affordable energy supplies while moving to
low-carbon energy. 
In 2024, my second year as Chief Executive Officer, I am proud of 
the progress we have made in putting our strategy into action. I want 
to thank everyone at Shell for their contribution. We are growing 
shareholder returns, while working to reduce emissions from our 
operations and products. We are positioning Shell to win through the 
energy transition on our journey to become a net-zero emissions energy 
business by 2050.
Integrated energy company
Our strategy aims to grow our world-leading LNG business, which 
provides flexibility alongside renewable energy, and a lower-carbon 
alternative to coal. We expect that supplying LNG will be the biggest 
contribution we will make to the energy transition over the next 
decade, as we help to build the energy system of the future.
Building on our deep knowledge and strong partnerships, we are also 
responsibly producing the oil that will be needed for decades to come, 
with a focus on cost and carbon competitiveness. We intend to be the 
most customer-focused energy marketer and trader in the world, 
providing people with the energy they need to power their lives and 
businesses. We are developing commercial models for low-carbon 
solutions, such as biofuels. My vision is for Shell to become the world's 
leading integrated energy company, delivering impact at scale, 
connecting energy and people, matching supply to demand. 
We have set out to transform Shell into a more focused and more 
competitive energy business, and I am pleased to say that in 2024, 
we moved forward at pace in that direction. Following our principles 
of performance, discipline and simplification, we have made good 
progress against the targets and ambition we presented at our Capital 
Markets Day in 2023 and in our Energy Transition Strategy 2024.

More value
In 2024, we achieved our target to reduce structural costs* by $2-3 
billion by the end of 2025, against 2022, one year ahead of time. 
We continued to make disciplined investments, and difficult choices, 
such as pausing construction of our biofuels plant in Rotterdam, the 
Netherlands, to assess the most commercial way forward. 
We are building a strong track record of performance. Shell reported 
the second-highest cash flow from operations in our history in 2024, 
outperforming our target for free cash flow growth. By the end of the 
year, we had delivered at the top end of our target to distribute 
30-40% of cash flow from operations to our shareholders*, mainly 
through buybacks. 
Our Prelude floating LNG facility off the coast of Australia had 
record production in 2024, as did our QGC natural gas business in 
Queensland, Australia, boosting our operational performance. We 
added major new projects. We took a final investment decision on 
Bonga North, off the coast of Nigeria, which is expected to start up by 
the end of the decade and reach peak production of 110,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent a day. Our US deep-water platform Whale started 
production in January 2025, with estimated peak production of 
100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. 
Our agreement to acquire Pavilion Energy in Singapore further 
strengthened our LNG portfolio with more sales and flexibility. 
I also signed an agreement in Abu Dhabi to invest in the Ruwais LNG 
project [A], which is designed to operate with lower carbon intensity 
than traditional LNG plants. LNG Canada is expected to start 
producing in the middle of 2025, the largest private-sector energy 
investment in Canada's history.
Another example of our transformation is the sale of Shell Pakistan, 
which is helping us to achieve our aim to divest around 500 retail sites 
every year until 2025. 
Less emissions
In 2024, we worked hard towards our climate goals. We abated more 
than 1 million tonnes of CO2 from our operations through projects such 
as reduced flaring and the use of renewable electricity. This allowed us 
to keep our Scope 1 and 2 emissions roughly flat compared with 2023, 
despite increased oil and gas production and asset utilisation. By the 
end of 2024, we had achieved 60% of the reduction required to meet 
our 2030 Scope 1 and 2 target.
Shell remains a leader in reducing emissions of methane, a potent 
greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG 
production. By the end of 2024, we had reduced total methane 
emissions from assets under our operational control by 76% compared 
with 2016. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets 
remained stable in 2024, and, as of January 1, 2025, we no longer 
routinely flare from these assets. 
[A] Subject to completion.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
When it comes to our sales, we achieved our short-term target to 
reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell with 
a 9% reduction compared with 2016, moving us closer to our target 
of a 15-20% reduction by 2030 compared with 2016 levels.
By the end of 2024, we had installed more than 70,000 public charge 
points for electric vehicles, a year ahead of schedule. I am encouraged 
by the progress we are making in carbon capture and storage, with 
plans for two linked projects in Canada. In Norway, our Northern Lights 
joint venture is ready to offer commercial carbon transport and storage 
as a service. I saw for myself another exciting initiative, our first 
megawatt charger for electric trucks and ships in Amsterdam.
Beyond our operations, 2024 was an important year because the 
Court of Appeal of The Hague dismissed Milieudefensie's claim against 
Shell. I believe the decision was the right one for the energy transition 
and our company. On February 11, 2025, Milieudefensie announced 
that it was taking its case to the Netherlands' Supreme Court. I am 
confident in the strength of our position.
Shell people
The safety of everyone at Shell remains our top priority. I am deeply 
saddened by the deaths of four people working for Shell in 2024 
and early 2025. These tragic incidents took place in India, Malaysia, 
the Netherlands and Nigeria. My heart goes out to the families and 
friends of these four people. We must continue to protect everyone 
working for Shell, and we will learn from these and other incidents.
Shell's success depends on our people. I experienced the dynamism 
and diversity of our teams when I visited our operations in Brazil, 
China, India, Kuwait, Oman, Poland, Qatar, and the USA. I was 
impressed by how they are embracing the principles of performance, 
discipline and simplification in their everyday work.
I also spent Safety Day with our team at the Shell Polymers Monaca 
chemical plant in the USA. Once again, I had the opportunity to 
witness first-hand how far we have advanced our safety culture and 
processes in recent years.
Investment case and partner of choice
I am convinced that we are the best positioned energy company to 
navigate the energy transition because of our people, our connections 
to customers, and our portfolio of world-class assets. We are building on 
these strengths by transforming Shell. We are becoming a more focused 
and competitive business, so that we are the investment case and partner 
of choice through the energy transition. We had another strong year in 
2024, and we have more to do. I am confident that our strategy, 
executed with conviction and determination, is working. We are on the 
path to becoming the world's leading integrated energy company.

Shell is a global group of energy and petrochemical 
companies, employing around 96,000 people [A] 
across more than 70 countries. We have activities 
ranging from oil and gas exploration and production 
to the marketing of fuels and lubricants, and research 
and development. We are increasingly offering our 
customers low-carbon energy solutions.
For more than a century, Shell has connected people and energy. We 
provide the energy people need to fuel their homes, hospitals, schools, 
vehicles, machinery and factories. Our purpose is to power progress 
together, by working with each other, our customers and our partners. 
Our vision [B] is to be the world's leading integrated energy company -- 
delivering impact at scale, connecting energy and people, matching 
supply to demand. 
Shell's strategy is to deliver more value with less emissions as we work 
to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050. As we navigate the 
energy transition through the next decade, we will leverage our global 
footprint, the trust in our brand, and our innovation and technology 
capabilities to be the energy company that customers and countries 
choose to be their partner. 
Our people and values
Whether they work on our platforms and pipelines, or in our offices 
and research labs, people are key to our success. They collectively 
determine our culture and we expect them to behave according 
to our values: honesty, integrity and respect for people. 
We expect everyone at Shell to also comply with relevant laws and 
regulations to help us conduct business in an ethical and transparent 
manner. We firmly believe in the fundamental importance of trust, 
openness, teamwork and professionalism. The Board assesses and 
monitors our culture and how it is embedded in our attitudes and 
behaviours, including in our activities and stakeholder relationships. 
To realise our vision, we are transforming Shell to become a more 
focused and competitive business. Our extraordinary community of 
talent will approach the next decade of the energy transition with 
courage and determination. We expect Shell's people to care about 
each other, our work, and about doing business the right way with a 
focus on safety, people and sustainability. 
The Shell General Business Principles set out our responsibilities to all 
our stakeholders. As part of these principles, we commit to contribute 
to sustainable development, and we have embedded this commitment 
into our strategy, our processes and decision-making. This requires 
balancing short- and long-term interests, integrating economic, 
environmental and social considerations into business decision-making. 
As we implement our strategy, we will also maintain our relentless focus 
on achieving our Goal Zero ambition: to do no harm to people and to 
have no leaks across operations. The Shell Code of Conduct explains 
how employees, contractors and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell 
must behave. 
Strong relationships
We seek to build strong, trusted relationships with all our stakeholders, 
including our approximately 1 million commercial and industrial 
customers, and the around 33 million people we serve daily at our 
Shell-branded retail stations. Our stakeholders include: our employees, 
contractors and pensioners; the investor community; customers; our 
suppliers and strategic partners; regulators and governments; non-
governmental organisations, civil society, academia and think tanks; 
and the communities where we work.

---- Page 12 ----
Our strategy is to deliver more value with less emissions. 
Our vision [A] is to be the world's leading integrated energy company 
and our strategy is to deliver more value with less emissions. We are 
positioning Shell to become the investment case and partner of choice 
through the energy transition.
More value 
We are committed to enhancing value for our investors through 
disciplined investments, enhanced shareholder distributions and 
maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our focus remains on providing 
secure and reliable products, both now and throughout the energy 
transition, to meet the evolving needs of our customers. At Capital 
Markets Day 2023 (CMD23), we outlined our specific targets, and the 
progress we have made against these targets is presented on page 14.
Less emissions
We are committed to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business 
by 2050. We have set climate targets and an ambition, outlined in our 
Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24), to help us reach net zero. 
ETS24 was approved by 78% of shareholders who voted at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in May. Progress against our climate targets 
and ambition is presented on page 93. 
Shell aims to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive 
strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory 
support from governments. We will continue to provide our customers 
with the energy and other products they need, and we will provide this 
affordably and reliably, while also increasingly offering them low-
carbon energy solutions to help them decarbonise their activities.
Moving forward
In 2024, we delivered our strategy against the four themes of 
generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, respecting 
nature and powering lives. These themes are presented on pages 12-13.
Like all businesses, we will continue to adapt how we implement our 
strategy as the world evolves. This adaptability is crucial for navigating 
the dynamic energy landscape enabling long-term success. 
Capital Markets Day on March 25, 2025, presents an update to our 
financial targets for investors. See pages 16-17.
[A] A vision statement defines the desired future state of a company rather than a series 
of firm, binding commitments.

We will deliver more value with less emissions by:
￮ Growing our integrated gas and LNG business.
￮ Sustaining liquids production.
￮ Focusing Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. 
Growing our integrated gas and LNG business
We are investing in our gas production and growing our LNG business 
to deliver the secure energy the world needs. LNG is a critical fuel for 
the energy transition because it is a lower-carbon alternative to coal in 
power generation and can be easily transported to where it is needed. 
Sustaining liquids production 
We aim to sustain liquids production of at least 1.4 million barrels a 
day through to 2030 with increasingly lower carbon intensity. We are 
focusing our exploration activities in locations where hydrocarbons 
have already been discovered. 
Focusing Downstream, Renewables 
and Energy Solutions 
We are expanding our premium marketing businesses while 
streamlining our portfolio with a focus on value over volume. We will 
build on the options we have invested in for low-carbon growth through 
the energy transition. Our global customer reach and our supply and 
trading capabilities position us well to deliver the low-carbon solutions 
people and businesses need.
Strategic Report | Shell's strategy
Our strategy
10 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 13 ----
We are seeking to change the mix of energy products we sell to our 
customers as their needs for energy change. We believe we can make 
the greatest contribution to the energy transition by helping to enable 
our customers to switch to low-carbon energy products and services.
 
This is reflected in Shell's strategy to build a portfolio that seeks to:
￮develop low- and zero-carbon alternatives to traditional fuel, 
including biofuels, and other low- and zero-carbon gases;
￮ provide more renewable power solutions to customers in select 
markets;
￮ work with customers across different sectors to help them 
decarbonise their use of energy, for example by substituting the 
use of coal with LNG; and
￮ address any remaining emissions from conventional fuels with 
solutions such as CCS and high-quality carbon credits.
As we implement our strategy, we will continue to focus on performance, 
discipline and simplification. This applies not only to our financial and 
operational outcomes, but also to safety and sustainability. Our Goal 
Zero ambition is fundamental to the success of our company. 
See "Safety" on page 122.
We believe that no business can succeed without an unwavering 
commitment to respecting the environment and the communities within 
which it works. At Shell, we seek to protect the environment, increase 
our reuse and recycling, make a positive contribution to biodiversity 
and use water and other resources efficiently. We also work to make 
a positive impact on people around the world, and power lives through 
our products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.

Generating 
shareholder value
We aim to generate more value for shareholders 
through disciplined capital allocation, strong financial 
performance and by maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
We seek to provide enhanced shareholder distributions through 
our progressive dividend policy and share buyback programmes. 
2024 performance
￮ Total shareholder distributions* were $23 billion, comprising 
$9 billion in cash dividends and $14 billion in share buybacks.
￮ Total shareholder distributions* were 41% of cash flow from 
operating activities.
￮ Cash flow from operating activities was $55 billion.
￮ Cash capital expenditure* was $21 billion.
￮ Total debt was reduced to $77 billion and net debt* was
$39 billion as of December 31, 2024. Net debt excluding leases* 
was $10 billion.
￮ Structural cost reductions* were $3.1 billion from a 2022 baseline 
and against a $2-3 billion target by the end of 2025.
￮ The annual dividend was $1.390 per share, and the quarterly 
dividend increased to $0.358 per share for the fourth quarter.
Information on our progress against our longer-term targets included

cash capital expenditure lowered to $20-22 billion*per year from 
2025-2028. 
￮ Grow normalised free cash flow per share* on average by more 
than 10% per year through to 2030.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
Achieving net-zero 
emissions
We have a target to become a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050 and will work with customers 
to help them decarbonise.
We are transforming our business, including selling more low-carbon 
products and services. We are working with our customers and others 
to help accelerate the energy transition. We advocate policies, 
legislation and regulation that will generate demand for investment 
in a low-carbon energy system.
2024 performance
￮ Scope 1 and 2 emissions were down by 30% compared with the 
2016 reference year [A].
￮ Methane emissions intensity of 0.04% continued to be below our 
0.2% target.
￮ Net carbon intensity (NCI) decreased by 9.0% compared with the 
2016 reference year and was within the 2024 target range.
￮ Routine flaring from upstream operations remained stable at 0.1

Powering
lives
We power lives through our products and activities, 
and by supporting an inclusive society.
We provide vital energy for homes, businesses and transport. We also 
aim to create a desirable workplace that is accepting and inclusive and 
representative of the communities we are a part of. Additionally, our 
activities generate revenues for governments through the taxes and 
royalties we pay, and the taxes we collect on their behalf.
2024 performance
￮ In 2024, we spent around $42 billion on goods and services* 
from suppliers around the world. 
￮ In 2024, taxes paid* were $18 billion.
￮ In 2024, representation of women in Senior Leadership [A] grew 
to 33%.
￮ As of December 31, 2024, 15% of Shell's Senior Management [B] 
identifies as being from an ethnic minority group.
￮ Our 2024 Shell People Survey showed a result of 81 points out of

Leadership based in the UK and is a Shell measure based on compensation grade levels.
[C] See Powering Lives for examples of how we seek to be a good neighbour.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445 ).
Respecting
nature
We seek to protect the environment, increase our reuse 
and recycling, make a positive contribution to biodiversity 
and use water and other resources efficiently.
Our businesses use natural resources such as land and water for their 
operations. Our activities can impact nature through discharges and 
emissions to the environment, and through changes to the use of land 
and water. We assess and manage the impact of our operations on 
local ecosystems and communities. 
2024 performance
￮ We continued to embed respect for nature into our activities, 
standards and business processes, including by ensuring that 
these are reflected in our Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management (SEAM) Standards.
￮ In partnership with Monash University, we are executing an 
ecological restoration programme on Browse Island, Australia, 
to eradicate invasive alien species, improve reef health and 
promote the return of breeding seabirds.
￮ At the Pearl GTL gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar, we diverted 
waste to local cement kilns for use as clinker in cement production, 
thereby reducing use of raw materials and the amount of waste 
sent to landfill. 
As we implement our strategy, we will work to: 
￮Achieve net-zero deforestation from new activities 
by replanting forests, while maintaining biodiversity and 
conservation value.
￮ Achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity, based 
on reference year 2021, for new projects in critical habitats.
￮ Better understand the types of waste we generate and identify 
options to increase circular approaches.
￮ Implement water stewardship principles across our businesses, 
including the sustainable management of fresh-water resources, 
particularly in water-stressed areas.

---- Page 16 ----
In 2024, we continued to make good progress in delivering on the longer-term targets as set out at our Capital 
Markets Day in June 2023 and in our Energy Transition Strategy 2024. We are ahead of schedule across the 
majority of our key targets, delivering more value with less emissions. 
More value
Targets included at Capital Markets Day 2023 [A]
Shareholder 
distributions 30-40% 
of CFFO* through 
the cycle [B]
(%)
Shareholder distributions as % of CFFO is used to demonstrate Shell 
plc's progress on increasing returns to shareholders through the cycle.
Total shareholder distributions* in 2024 of $23 billion comprised of $9 
billion in dividends and $14 billion in share buybacks, representing 41% 
of CFFO. Average shareholder distributions since the end of 2022 of 
42% of CFFO, at the top of our target range of 30--40%. 
Structural cost 
reduction* of $2-3 
billion by end of 2025 
[D]
($ billion)
Structural cost reduction is used to demonstrate how management 
drives cost discipline across the entire organisation by simplifying 
our processes and portfolio, and streamlining the way we work.
Structural cost reduction* of $3.1 billion delivered since the end of 
2022, one year ahead of our target date of end of 2025 and above 
the range of $2-3 billion set in 2023. Of the cost reduction delivered, 
$1.2 billion relates to portfolio changes and $1.9 billion relates to 
operational efficiencies across our businesses, a leaner corporate 
centre, and faster decision-making in project development.
Price-normalised FCF 
growth* > 6% per 
year through 2030 [C]
($ billion)
Price-normalised FCF growth demonstrates the growth in underlying 
business performance and removes the impact of macroeconomic 
price movements for a more comparable figure.
Average annual growth in price-normalised FCF of 27% since 2022 
continued to outperform our targeted growth of more than 6% per 
year. This reflects our improved operational performance, discipline 
in cash capital expenditure and structural cost reduction. 
Price-normalised FCF 
growth/share* > 10% 
per year through 
2025 [C]
($/share)
The price-normalised FCF growth per share demonstrates the increase 
in cash distribution to shareholders and removes the impact of 
macroeconomic price movements for a more comparable figure.
Average annual growth in price-normalised FCF per share of 36% since 
2022 continued to outperform our targeted growth of more than 10% 
per year. This reflects our price-normalised FCF growth as well as a 
lower number of shares in issue as a result of our ongoing share 
buyback programme.

Less emissions
Targets included in our Energy Transition Strategy 2024
Net-zero emissions 
by 2050 (Scope 1, 
2 and 3) [D], [E]
(million tonnes of CO2e)
Net-zero emissions demonstrate our progress towards achieving our 
target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.
Net absolute emissions continued to decrease in 2024, principally 
driven by a reduction in our sales of oil products.
Reduce the net 
carbon intensity (NCI) 
of the products we 
sell by 15-20% by 
2030 [D], [F] 
(gCO2e/MJ)
The NCI metric is used to track progress in reducing the overall carbon 
intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. 
NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume of the energy 
products we sell. With a reduction of 9.0% compared with the 2016 
baseline, our interim target to reduce our NCI by 9-12% in 2024 is met.
The decrease in NCI compared with 2023 is mainly driven by a 
reduction in our sales of oil products, continued growth in our power 
sales and a reduction in average oil product intensity. 
Halving Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 2030 
under operational 
control (2016 
baseline) [D]
(million tonnes of CO2e)
We have set a target to halve the emissions from our operations 
(Scope 1) and the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2) by 2030 
compared with 2016 levels, on a net basis.
Combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2024 reflect a 30% reduction 
compared with the 2016 baseline. The slightly higher emissions 
compared to 2023 were due to higher utilisation and production, 
offset by reductions from abatement projects.
Eliminate routing flaring from upstream operations by 2025 
[D], [G] and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 
[D], [H]
Routine flaring
(million tonnes)
Methane emissions intensity
(%) [I]
In 2024, total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets 
remained stable compared with 2023. From January 1, 2025, our 
target of ending routine flaring from upstream operations has been met 
(independent of the March 13, 2025 completion of the sales of SPDC). 
We continued to deliver methane emissions intensities well below our 
0.2% target.
In addition to these targets we have an ambition to reduce the 
customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 
2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). See "Our journey 
to net zero" on page 102.

Capital Markets Day on March 25, 2025, presents 
an update to our financial targets for investors. 
Our vision [A] is to be the world's leading integrated energy company. 
Shell is transforming to become simpler, more resilient and competitive. 
We want to become the world's leading integrated gas and LNG 
business and the most customer-focused energy marketer and trader, 
while sustaining a material level of liquids production. 
We are building on the significant progress we have made in executing 
our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. As we do this, 
we will maintain our focus on performance, discipline and simplification. 
We aim to grow returns for shareholders, while reducing our emissions 
and helping our customers reduce theirs.
To successfully implement our strategy, we will take a value-led 
approach through a financial framework which enhances shareholder 
distributions, and maintains discipline in capital allocation and a 
balance sheet with a strong investment grade rating. 
Financial discipline and strategic focus
We will maintain our focus on performance, cost and capital discipline, 
investing in areas of competitive strength to maximise returns. 
Updates to our financial targets:
￮ Enhance shareholder distributions from 30--40% to 40--50% of cash 
flow from operations* through the cycle, continuing to prioritise 
share buybacks while maintaining the 4% a year progressive 
dividend policy [B].
￮ Increase the structural cost reduction* target from $2--3 billion by 
the end of 2025 to a cumulative $5--7 billion by the end of 2028, 
compared with 2022.
￮ Invest for growth while maintaining capital discipline with cash 
capital expenditure* lowered to $20--22 billion a year for 
2025--2028 compared with $21 billion in 2024.
￮ Grow normalised free cash flow per share* on average by more 
than 10% a year through to 2030. 
[A] A vision statement defines the desired future state of a company rather than a series 
of firm, binding commitments.

---- Page 19 ----
The Board intends to enhance shareholder distributions through a 
combination of dividends and share buybacks, maintaining a 4% 
progressive dividend policy. 
When the Board sets the level of shareholder distributions, it looks
at a range of factors including the macro environment, underlying 
business earnings and Group cash flows, the current balance 
sheet, future investment, acquisition and divestment plans, and 
existing commitments.
Growth and resilience through the energy transition 
Shell believes the world is facing a complex, multi-decade energy 
transition in which there will be growing demand for secure, affordable 
and, increasingly, low-carbon energy. 
In liquefied natural gas (LNG), we will reinforce our leadership position 
by growing sales 4--5% a year through to 2030. 
We will also grow production across our combined Upstream and 
Integrated Gas business by 1% a year to 2030, sustaining our 1.4 
million barrels a day of liquids production with increasingly lower 
carbon intensity.
And, we will drive cash flow resilience and higher returns in 
Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions by: 
￮Pursuing focused growth in our high-return Mobility and Lubricants 
businesses.
￮ Leveraging competitive strengths to drive profitable and scalable 
businesses across our lower-carbon platforms [A] where we expect 
to have up to 10% of capital employed by 2030.
￮ Unlocking more value from our strong portfolio of Chemicals assets. 
This will be done by exploring strategic and partnership 
opportunities in the USA and through high-grading and selective 
closures in Europe. We believe this will enable the business to 
prosper while improving returns and reducing capital employed 
by 2030. 
[A] Shell's lower-carbon platforms include low-carbon fuels, carbon capture and storage, and 
hydrogen, as well as power which includes renewable generation and gas fired power. 
Shell will continue to deliver more value with less emissions, growing 
in areas where we have competitive strengths. We believe we are 
providing a compelling investment case for our shareholders, now, 
and into the future.
Performance culture and commitment 
We will continue to embed a performance culture, empowering our 
people with greater ownership and faster decision-making, helping 
to ensure safe and responsible operations. 
Shell is committed to delivering on our promises, transforming to 
become more resilient and competitive, and driving growth and 
value creation through disciplined execution of our strategy. 
We are confident in our ability to navigate the energy transition 
and deliver enhanced returns for our shareholders.

Performance
in the year
Performance indicators
These indicators enable management to evaluate 
Shell's performance against our annual Operating Plan. 
They are also used as part of determining Executive 
Directors' remuneration. See "Directors' Remuneration 
Report" on pages 188-190.
Safety
Personal safety
(SIF-F cases per 100
million working hours)
Serious injury, illness and fatality (SIF) is defined as a serious work-
related injury or illness that resulted in a fatality or permanent 
impairment. For SIF Frequency (SIF-F), the number of SIF employee 
and contractor incidents is divided by 100 million working hours. 
2024 performance
Despite improvement, the result reflects two fatalities and five serious 
injuries reported in 2024, which is too many. We will continue to 
strengthen the safety culture among our employees and contract staff.
Process safety
(number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 
events)
Operational process safety events are defined as the unplanned or 
uncontrolled release of any material from a process with the greatest 
actual consequence resulting in harm to employees, contract staff, a 
neighbouring community, or damage to equipment, or exceeding a 
threshold quantity.
2024 performance
The increase in process safety tiered events was driven by our 
Downstream and Renewables businesses. We are actively addressing 
these challenges by refining our operational strategies, renewing our 
focus on fundamentals and leveraging new technologies to return to 
the downward trend of previous years.
For details on our safety performance see "Safety" on pages 122-124
[A] 2022 adjustment on SIF-F from 1.7 to 2.0 is due to a change in classification for one injury 
after publication of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts.
Financial delivery
Cash flow from 
operating activities
($ billion)
Total cash receipts and payments associated with oil, gas, chemicals 
and other product sales. This reflects our ability to generate cash to 
service and reduce debt, invest and make shareholder distributions.
2024 performance
Driven mainly by a strong operational performance.
See "Liquidity and capital resources" on pages 24-27.
Shell's journey in the energy transition
LNG volumes
(million tonnes)
Shell's share of sales of equity LNG volumes from liquefaction plants 
owned by Shell subsidiaries, Shell joint ventures and associates, and 
Shell's share of LNG produced from liquefaction plants which operate 
under tolling arrangements with Shell.
2024 performance
LNG liquefaction volumes increased mainly due to lower maintenance 
in Australia.
See "Integrated Gas" on page 31.
Reducing operational 
emissions
(Scope 1 and 2; thousand 
tonnes CO2)
Operational emission reductions achieved from GHG abatement 
projects (e.g. reduced flaring, increased energy efficiency, and use 
of renewable electricity), site closures and decommissioning or 
transformations, resulting in sustained GHG reductions.
2024 performance
This was mainly due to catalyst improvements at Pearl GTL in Qatar, 
routine flaring reduction (Forcados Yokri Gas Project) in Nigeria and 
optimisation of the liquefaction control system at QGC in Australia.
See "Our journey to net zero" on pages 76-108.
Electric vehicle (EV)
charge points
(thousand)
Number of public electric vehicle charge points owned, controlled, or 
Shell branded. The definition has been revised to exclude operated 
only charge points. Prior year figures have been restated.
2024 performance
Performance was largely due to growth in top adoption markets, and 
we achieved our goal of installing 70,000 public charge points a year 
ahead of schedule.
See "Marketing" on pages 55-59.

Operational excellence
Project delivery
on schedule
(%)
Our capability to complete major projects on time, measured as the 
percentage of projects delivered on schedule.
2024 performance
Highlights for this year include the successful start-up of 10 projects, 
half of which came on-stream ahead of schedule.
Project delivery
on budget
(%)
Aggregate cost against the aggregate baseline for those projects, 
where a figure greater than 100% means over budget. 
2024 performance
The result was impacted by the decision to pause on-site construction 
at our biofuels plant in Rotterdam.
Customer satisfaction
(index)
This quantitative measurement of customer experience performance 
is calculated as a simple average of customer satisfaction scores from 
the global business-to-business transactional survey programme.
2024 performance
The result reflects focus on prioritisation, continuous improvement of
e-commerce platforms, and the resilience of our teams.
Brand Share
Preference
(%)
The percentage of customers answering "Shell" when asked: "Assuming 
that all the fuel station companies that you would consider are 
conveniently located, which one company do you prefer most?" The 
responses are taken from survey respondents in more than 60 countries 
covering both fuel and non-fuel retail consumers.
2024 performance
Our Brand Share Preference continued to rise, performing ahead of 
expectations in all regions.
Upstream controllable
availability
(%)
Reflects our ability to optimally run our Upstream assets and includes 
all Shell-operated assets and selected assets not operated by Shell 
but for which Shell has strategic influence. It excludes the impact of 
extreme unexpected events that are outside our control, such as 
government restrictions and hurricanes. Reliability issues, turnarounds 
and maintenance at own-operated or third-party facilities impact 
controllable availability.
2024 performance
Performance improved, particularly in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway, 
Oman and the USA, partially offset by lower performance in the UK.
Midstream
availability
(%)
The extent to which LNG assets are ready to process product as a 
comparison with capacity, considering the impact of planned and 
unplanned maintenance.
2024 performance
Improved performance, especially in Australia, Qatar and Oman.
Refinery and chemical 
plant availability
(%)
Weighted average of plants' actual uptime, as a percentage of their 
maximum possible uptime, is a measure of the operational excellence 
of our refinery and chemical plant facilities. The weighting is based on 
the capital employed, adjusted for cash and non-current liabilities.
2024 performance
Improvements this year were mainly in Shell Polymers Monaca in the 
USA and Bukom Refinery in Singapore.

We made significant progress towards the financial 
targets that we set at Capital Markets Day 2023. Our focus 
on performance, discipline and simplification has been key to 
achieving these results, enabling us to deliver more value with 
less emissions. In 2024, we reported the second-highest cash flow 
from operations in our history. Our operational performance has 
also improved. We have brought a number of projects online and 
we have taken disciplined final investment decisions that will help 
strengthen Shell further.
Earnings 2024-2023
Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders in 2024 was $16,094 
million, compared with $19,359 million in 2023. With non-controlling 
interest included, income for the period in 2024 was $16,521 million, 
compared with $19,636 million in 2023. After current cost of supplies 
adjustment, total segment earnings* in 2024 were $16,792 million, 
compared with $20,281 million in 2023.
Adjusted Earnings* in 2024 were $23,716 million, compared with 
$28,250 million in 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by lower 
LNG trading and optimisation margins, lower realised prices, lower 
refining margins as well as lower trading and optimisation margins 
of power and pipeline gas in Renewables and Energy Solutions, 
partly offset by lower operating expenses and higher realised 
Chemicals margins. 
2024 income attributable to Shell plc shareholders also included net 
impairment charges and reversals of $4,371 million, reclassifications 
from equity to profit and loss of cumulative currency translation 
differences related to funding structures, unfavourable movements 
relating to an accounting mismatch due to fair value accounting 
of commodity derivatives, and charges related to redundancy and 
restructuring. These charges, reclassifications and movements are 
included in identified items amounting to a net loss of $7,365 million.
Integrated Gas
Integrated Gas segment earnings* in 2024 were $9,590 million, 
compared with $7,057 million in 2023. The increase was mainly 
driven by lower unfavourable movements relating to an accounting 
mismatch due to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, lower 
net impairment charges and reversals, higher volumes, lower operating 
expenses, and favourable deferred tax movements, partly offset by the 
combined effect of lower contributions from trading and optimisation 
and lower realised prices.
See "Integrated Gas" on page 31.
Upstream
Upstream segment earnings* in 2024 were $7,772 million, compared 
with $8,540 million in 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by 
unfavourable tax movements, lower realised prices and higher 
exploration well write-offs, partly offset by the comparative 
favourable impact relating to gas storage effects. 
See "Upstream" on page 38.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
Marketing
Marketing segment earnings* in 2024 were $1,894 million, compared 
with $3,057 million in 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by higher 
net impairment charges and reversals, net losses related to sale of 
assets, unfavourable tax movements and higher depreciation charges. 
These were partly offset by higher Marketing margins including higher 
unit margins in Lubricants and Mobility, partly compensated by lower 
Sectors and Decarbonisation margins. Segment earnings also 
reflected lower operating expenses.
See "Marketing" on page 55.
Chemicals and Products
Chemicals and Products segment earnings* in 2024 were $1,757 
million, compared with $1,482 million in 2023. The increase was 
mainly driven by lower net impairment charges and reversals, lower 
operating expenses and higher Chemicals margins. These were partly 
offset by lower Products margins, largely due to lower refining margins, 
unfavourable movements relating to an accounting mismatch due 
to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and unfavourable tax 
movements.
See "Chemicals and Products" on page 60.
Renewables and Energy Solutions
Renewables and Energy Solutions segment earnings* in 2024 were an 
expense of $1,229 million, compared with a gain of $3,089 million in 
2023. The decrease was mainly driven by lower favourable movements 
relating to an accounting mismatch due to fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives, lower margins, largely from trading and 
optimisation primarily in Europe due to lower volatility and higher 
net impairment charges and reversals, partly offset by lower 
operating expenses.
See "Renewables and Energy Solutions" on page 68.
Corporate
Corporate segment earnings* in 2024 were an expense of 
$2,992 million, compared with an expense of $2,944 million in 
2023. The increase was mainly driven by reclassifications from equity 
to profit and loss of cumulative currency translation differences related 
to funding structures, partly offset by favourable tax movements, 
favourable net interest movements and favourable currency 
exchange rate effects. 
See "Corporate" on page 72.

Prior year earnings summary
Our earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 
2023, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2022, 
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 32) and 
Form 20-F (page 30) for the year ended December 31, 2023, 
as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales 
and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was $54,687 million in 2024, 
compared with $54,191 million in 2023. Cash flow from operating 
activities in 2024 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA, and 
working capital inflow of $2,062 million, partly offset by tax payments 
of $12,002 million.
Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure* was $21,085 million in 2024, compared
with $24,392 million in 2023.
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 87.
Operating expenses and Underlying operating expenses
Operating expenses* were $36,917 million in 2024, compared 
with $39,960 million in 2023. Underlying operating expenses* 
were $35,707 million, compared with $39,201 million in 2023. 
The decrease in both Operating expenses and Underlying operating 
expenses was mainly driven by structural cost reductions delivered 
through operational efficiencies across our businesses, a leaner 
corporate centre, faster decision-making in project development, 
and portfolio changes.
Return on average capital employed on an Adjusted 
Earnings plus Non-controlling interest (NCI) basis
Our ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings plus Non-controlling interest 
basis* decreased to 11.3%, compared with 12.8% in 2023, mainly 
driven by lower earnings.

Production available for sale
Oil and gas production available for sale in 2024 was 2,836 thousand 
boe/d, compared with 2,791 thousand boe/d in 2023. This increase 
was mainly driven by growth from new fields and partly offset by 
divestments.

Liquidity and capital resources 
Liquidity and capital resources
Shell generated free cash flow*of $39.5 billion in 2024, aided 
by disciplined capital management, portfolio simplification and 
operational performance improvements. Net debt* decreased to 
$38.8 billion at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: $43.5 
billion). Total debt decreased to $77.1 billion at December 31, 2024 
(December 31, 2023: $81.5 billion). Gearing* decreased to 17.7% 
at December 31, 2024, compared with 18.8% at December 31, 2023. 
See Note 21 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 284-285.
Liquidity
Shell satisfies its funding, liquidity and working capital requirements by 
using cash generated from our operations, taking on debt and through 
divestments. In 2024, access to the international debt capital markets 
remained strong, with Shell's debt principally financed from 
these markets through central debt programmes consisting of: 
￮a $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, with 
maturities between 183 days and 364 days;
￮ a $10 billion US CP programme, with maturities not exceeding 
397 days;
￮ an unlimited Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme (also 
referred to as the Multi-Currency Debt Securities Programme). 
This programme lapsed in November 2024, and will be renewed 
in the first half of 2025 or as required to issue debt; and
￮ an unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration. 
The debt issued under the CP, EMTN and US shelf has been issued by 
Shell International Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, with its 
debt being guaranteed by Shell plc. In 2023, Shell incorporated a new 
US subsidiary, Shell Finance US Inc., and in 2024 a portion of the debt 
issued by Shell International Finance B.V. was moved into this entity 
through an exchange offer. This debt remains guaranteed by Shell plc, 
as will any new debt issued by Shell Finance US Inc. under the US shelf.
We also maintain an $8 billion committed credit facility maturing in 
2026. This remained fully undrawn at December 31, 2024. This facility 
was reduced from $10 billion in the third quarter of 2024 due to the 
strong liquidity position of the Group. This reduced core facility and 
cash on balance sheet provide back-up coverage for our CP 
programmes. Other than certain borrowings by subsidiaries in their 
local jurisdictions, we do not have any other committed credit facilities. 
Our total debt decreased by $4.5 billion to $77.1 billion at December 
31, 2024. The total debt excluding lease liabilities matures as follows: 
14% in 2025; 8% in 2026; 5% in 2027 and 73% in 2028 and beyond. 
The portion of debt maturing in 2025 is expected to be repaid from 
some combination of cash balances, cash generated from operations, 
divestments and the issuance of new debt. In 2024, we did not issue 
any debt under our US shelf registration, EMTN programme or CP 
programmes. The Group had no CP outstanding at December 31, 2024. 
While our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign 
withholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash dividends, 
loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to have a 
material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations.

Market risk, credit risk and pension commitments
Financial risks
We use various financial instruments for managing exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate movements. Our treasury operations are 
highly centralised and seek to manage credit exposures associated 
with our substantial cash, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. 
Our portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid 
concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. 
Other than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative 
instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury 
organisations that have the appropriate skills, experience, 
supervision, control and reporting systems. 
We operate with procedures and policies designed to ensure that 
trading risks are managed within a prescribed control framework. The 
framework sets out authorised limits and requirements that trading 
should only be performed by employees with the appropriate skills and 
experience. Senior management regularly reviews these authorised 
trading limits. In addition, a department that is independent from our 
traders monitors our market risk exposures daily, using techniques such 
as value-at-risk alongside other risk metrics.
We have counterparty credit risk policies in place which seek to 
ensure that products are sold to customers with appropriate 
creditworthiness. These policies include detailed credit analysis and 
monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits. Where 
appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments 
and collateral are used to manage credit risk.
Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources 
(capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to 
meet foreseeable requirements.
A pensions forum chaired by the CFO oversees Shell's input to pension 
strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in 
reviewing the results of assurance processes with respect to pension 
risk. Local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans 
and set the strategic asset allocation for the plans, including the extent 
to which currency, interest rate and inflation risks are hedged, and the 
contributions paid are based on independent actuarial valuations that 
align with applicable local regulations. Pension fund liquidity is 
managed by holding appropriate liquid assets and maintaining credit 
facilities. Where appropriate, transactions to transfer pension liabilities 
to third parties are also considered. Our total employer contributions 
were $0.4 billion in 2024 and are estimated to be $0.9 billion in 2025. 
See "Risk factors" on page 139, Note 24 and Note 26 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" on pages 290-296 and 298-304.

guarantees where the potential obligations related to issuance are assessed to be remote.
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Cash flow from operating activities in 2024 was $54.7 billion, 
compared with $54.2 billion in 2023. The cash flow from operating 
activities in 2024 was primarily driven by Adjusted EBITDA and 
working capital inflow of $2.1 billion (compared with working 
capital inflow of $7.1 billion in 2023), partly offset by tax payments 
of $12.0 billion (compared with tax payments of $13.7 billion in 
2023). The cash flow from operating activities in 2024 also included 
favourable commodity-related derivative financial instrument 
movement of $2.5 billion (compared with unfavourable
movement of $5.7 billion in 2023).
Cash flow from investing activities in 2024 was an outflow of 
$15.2 billion, compared with an outflow of $17.7 billion in 2023. 
The cash flow from investing activities in 2024 included cash capital 
expenditure* of $21.1 billion (compared with cash capital expenditure 
of $24.4 billion in 2023), partly offset by divestment proceeds* of 
$2.8 billion (compared with divestment proceeds* of $3.1 billion in 
2023) and interest received of $2.4 billion (compared with interest 
received of $2.1 billion in 2023).
Cash flow from financing activities in 2024 was an outflow of 
$38.4 billion, compared with outflows of $38.2 billion in 2023, mainly 
due to lower repurchases of shares of $13.9 billion (2023: $14.6 
billion) and unfavourable debt-related derivative financial instrument 
movements of $0.6 billion (2023: $0.7 billion favourable movement) 
and lower net repayment of debt of $9.6 billion (2023: $9.8 billion 
net repayment). 
Cash and cash equivalents were $39.1 billion at December 31, 
2024 (December 31, 2023: $38.8 billion).
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
Prior year Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the financial year 
ended December 31, 2023, compared with the financial year ended 
December 31, 2022, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts 
(page 35) and Form 20-F (page 33) for the year ended December 31, 
2023, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales 
and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively. 
See "Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows" on page 244.
Cash flow from operating activities
The most significant factors affecting Shell's cash flow from operating 
activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices 
for crude oil, natural gas and LNG; production levels of crude oil, 
natural gas and LNG; chemicals, refining and marketing margins; 
and movements in working capital and derivative financial instruments. 
The impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends 
on: the extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market 
prices; the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of 
agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies 
that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax 
impacts; and the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow 
through into operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of 
crude oil and natural gas in any particular period provide only a broad 
indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings 
in that period. Changes in any factors, from within the industry or the 
broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing 
margins. The precise impact of any changes depends on how the oil 
markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors 
such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific 
grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; 
and the collective speed of response of refiners and product marketers 
in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region 
to region and from period to period.
Divestment and cash capital expenditure
The levels of divestment proceeds and cash capital expenditure in 
2024 and 2023 reflect our discipline and focus as we implement our 
strategy. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and 
businesses were $1.6 billion for 2024, compared with $2.6 billion 
in 2023. Divestment proceeds* for 2024 were $2.8 billion, compared 
with $3.1 billion in 2023. Cash capital expenditure split 
by segment is presented in the table below: 
Cash capital expenditure* [A]

Contractual obligations
The table below summarises Shell's principal contractual obligations at December 31, 2024, by expected settlement period. The amounts 
presented have not been offset by any committed third-party revenue in relation to these obligations.

Total  42.2  39.0  27.9  103.4  212.4 
[A] See Note 21 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". Debt contractual obligations exclude interest, which is estimated to be $1.4 billion payable in less than one year, $2.4 billion 
between one and three years, $2.2 billion between three and five years, and $12.2 billion in five years and later. For this purpose, we assume that interest rates with respect to variable 
interest rate debt remain constant at the rates in effect at December 31, 2024, and that there is no change in the aggregate principal amount of debt other than repayment at scheduled 
maturity as reflected in the table. Lease contractual obligations include interest.
[B] Purchase obligations disclosed in the above table exclude commodity purchase obligations that are not fixed or determinable and are principally intended to be resold in a short period of 
time through sale agreements with third parties. Examples include long-term non-cancellable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refined products or 
crude oil at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in measuring liquidity and cash flow, as the cash outflows generated by these purchases will generally be 
offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.
[C] Includes obligations included in "Trade and other payables" and provisions related to onerous contracts included in "Decommissioning and other provisions" in "Non-current liabilities" in the 
"Consolidated Balance Sheet" that are contractually fixed as to timing and amount. In addition to these amounts, Shell has certain obligations that are not contractually fixed as to timing and 
amount, including contributions to defined benefit pension plans (see Note 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements") and obligations associated with decommissioning and restoration 
(see Note 25 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements").
Shareholder distributions
We returned $8.7 billion to our shareholders through dividends 
and $13.9 billion through share buybacks in 2024. Total shareholder 
distributions represented 41% of cash flow from operating activities*. 
The fourth quarter 2024 dividend of $0.358 per share was paid
on March 24, 2025, to shareholders on the register at February 14, 
2025, and represents an increase of 4% compared with the third 
quarter of 2024.
See Note 30 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 308.
Purchases of securities
The intent to purchase shares was announced alongside the quarterly 
results during 2024, and covered the period up until the next quarterly 
announcement. In 2024, share buybacks of $3.5 billion were 
announced on February 1, $3.5 billion on May 2, $3.5 billion on 
August 1 and $3.5 billion on October 31 (finalised in the first quarter 
of 2025). In addition, on January 30, 2025, a further buyback of 
$3.5 billion was announced along with the fourth quarter 2024 
results; it is intended that this will be completed by the 
announcement date of the first quarter 2025 results.
During 2024, 409.1 million ordinary shares were purchased 
and cancelled. Overall, a total nominal share value of €29 million 
($34 million), 6.3% of the Company's total issued share capital at 
December 31, 2023, was purchased and cancelled during 2024 for 
a total cost of $13.9 billion, including expenses, at an average price 
of $34.36 per share.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
The buybacks completed in the first half of 2024 were in accordance 
with the authorities granted by shareholders at the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM). The buybacks completed in the second 
half of 2024 were in accordance with the authorities granted by 
shareholders at the 2024 AGM. At the 2024 AGM, authority was 
granted for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 10% of 
its issued ordinary shares, excluding treasury shares, (644.2 million 
ordinary shares), both on and off market, allowing purchases on the 
Amsterdam as well as London exchanges. As at December 31, 2024, 
468 million ordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current 
AGM authorities. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2024 was to 
reduce the issued share capital of the Company.
New resolutions will be proposed at the 2025 AGM to renew the 
authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to 
specified limits, for a further year. These proposals will be described 
in more detail in the 2025 Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Shares are also purchased by the employee share ownership 
trusts and trust-like entities (see Note 28 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on page 305) to meet delivery commitments 
under employee share plans. All share purchases are made in open 
market transactions. 
The table on the next page provides information on purchases of shares 
in 2024 and January 2025 by the Company and affiliated purchasers. 
Purchases in euros and sterling are converted into dollars using the 
exchange rate on each transaction date.

Financial information relating to the Royal Dutch Shell 
Dividend Access Trust
The results of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the Trust) 
are included in the consolidated results of operations and financial 
position of Shell. Certain condensed financial information in respect 
of the Trust is given below.
The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited and BG Group 
Limited have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare 
Trustees (Jersey) Limited (the Trustee). For the years 2024, 2023 
and 2022, the Trust recorded income before tax of £nil, £nil and £nil 
respectively. In each period, this reflected the amount of dividends 
payable on the dividend access shares. Dividends are also classified 
as unclaimed where amounts have not cleared recipient bank accounts.
At December 31, 2024, the Trust had total equity of £nil (December 31, 
2023: £nil; December 31, 2022: £nil), reflecting assets of £3 million 
(December 31, 2023: £4 million; December 31, 2022: £6 million) and 
unclaimed dividends of £3 million (December 31, 2023: £4 million; 
December 31, 2022: £6 million). The Trust only records a liability for 
an unclaimed dividend to the extent that dividend cheque payments 
have not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have 
been returned unpresented. As these unclaimed dividends relate to 
dividends that were announced by the Company during the period the 
Company was still named Royal Dutch Shell plc, and it is expected that 
the Company will not announce any further dividends on the dividend 
access shares, the Trust continues to be named the Royal Dutch Shell 
Dividend Access Trust. 
On January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through 
assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share 
of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or 
dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on 
dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the 
ordinary shares following the assimilation.
In relation to the assimilation of the Company's A and B shares, the 
Trust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate 
the payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for shareholders of the 
former B shares until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with 
the terms outlined. Dividends which are unclaimed after six years are 
forfeited and unconditionally revert to The Shell Transport and Trading 
Company Limited and BG Group Limited, as appropriate.

Market overview
Shell maintains a large and diversified business portfolio across 
an integrated value chain. We are exposed to fluctuating prices of 
crude oil, natural gas, oil products, chemicals and power. However, 
our diversified portfolio provides resilience when prices are volatile. 
Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim to 
ensure that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses 
are appropriate in the context of a volatile price environment. 
See "Risk factors" on page 135. 
We prepare an annual financial plan that tests different scenarios, and 
their impact on prices, on our businesses and organisation as a whole. 
These scenarios help us determine which issues could affect our 
operating environment and have implications for our strategy. They also 
help us to identify potential interventions to preserve our cash levels. 
We continually assess the external environment -- the markets and the 
underlying economic, political, social and environmental drivers that 
shape them -- to evaluate changes in competitive forces. We define 
multiple potential future scenarios and business environments by 
identifying drivers, uncertainties, enablers and constraints to our 
competitiveness. 
We also continually screen for new opportunities globally through 
our opportunity identification process. We test the resilience of our 
opportunities against a range of prices and costs for crude oil, 
natural gas, oil products and chemicals. These tests are based on 
short-, medium- and long-term market drivers, such as the extent and 
pace of the energy transition. Our opportunities are then ranked, 
prioritised and tested for strategic fit and value return expectations 
before being included in our growth funnel.
Global economic growth
In 2024, the global economy has demonstrated resilience at a time 
of geopolitical tensions, inflation and rising interest rates. The World 
Economic Outlook, published by the International Monetary Fund 
in January 2025, estimated global economic growth in 2024 to 
be 3.2% compared with 3.3% in 2023.
Macroeconomic performance was unevenly distributed. For example, 
growth in China disappointed, as stronger exports only partly offset 
a slowdown in consumption amid delayed stabilisation in the property 
market. India and Indonesia saw relatively brisk growth, while growth 
in Europe was strained, largely reflecting weakness in manufacturing 
and goods exports. By contrast, momentum in the USA remained 
robust with the economy powered by strong consumption.
Inflation receded further toward target levels in most countries, 
bolstering real incomes. From June 2024, many major central banks 
began cutting interest rates. This has supported deal-making and 
economic activity. However, growth is likely to be limited because 
of protectionist trade policies and economic challenges, such as high 
energy prices in Europe and the property market slowdown in China.
Global prices, demand and supply
The following table provides an overview of the main crude oil 
and natural gas price markers to which Shell is exposed:
Oil and gas average industry prices [A]
2024 2023 2022
Brent ($/b)  81  83  101 
West Texas Intermediate ($/b)  76  78  95 
Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)  2.2  2.5  6.4 
EU TTF ($/MMBtu)  11  13  40 
Japan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b) - 3 months  88  89  98 
[A] The 2024 average price for Japan Customs-cleared Crude is based on available market 
information up to the end of the period. Brent, West Texas Intermediate and EU TTF yearly 
average prices are based on daily spot prices. Henry Hub and Japan Customs-cleared 
Crude yearly average prices are based on monthly average prices.
Crude oil and oil products 
The global benchmark oil price Brent averaged $81 per barrel (bbl) 
in 2024, slightly lower than the average of $83/bbl in 2023. Prices 
continued to be volatile, with Brent daily spot ranging between $70/
bbl and $93/bbl. This reflected a well-supplied market due to slower 
economic growth and fuel substitution, as well as continued conflict 
in the Middle East and Europe. 
Global liquids demand growth was weaker in 2024, mainly due to 
significantly less demand growth from China. In 2023, demand from 
China increased by around 1.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) year-on-
year because of growth after COVID-19 but in 2024 this slowed to 
around 0.2 mb/d, mainly due to the country's economic slowdown and 
partly due to the rapid uptake of electric vehicles. This has driven the 
slowdown of overall global demand growth, from more than 2 mb/d 
in 2023 to just 0.9 mb/d in 2024. 
Global liquids supply growth came in slightly lower than demand 
growth at around 0.6 mb/d, which includes 0.2 mb/d of growth from 
global biofuel supplies and the rest from non-OPEC crude supplies. 
OPEC supply declined further, by around 0.2 mb/d year-on-year, 
as OPEC maintained a production cut to keep the market balanced. 
The timing for the unwinding of curtailed production of OPEC and its 
alliances has been a key factor for supply. The return of the voluntary 
cut, put in place in 2023, has been repeatedly delayed due to weak 
market conditions, and is now expected to happen in the second 
quarter of 2025 at the earliest. 
Conflicts in the Middle East and Europe caused some spikes in oil 
prices throughout the year as the market perceived increased risks to 
oil infrastructure and key shipping routes, such as the Red Sea. But the 
spikes were short-lived as the market continued to focus on demand 
and supply fundamentals.
In 2025, the slowdown in China is expected to continue to influence 
demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects continued 
below-trend growth from China and this could result in a similar rate 
of growth for global oil demand as in 2024. On the supply side,
non-OPEC supply — excluding US Light Tight Oil — is expected to rise, 
strongly bolstered by conventional offshore projects. Meanwhile, the 
market will continue to watch the pace at which OPEC unwinds its 
curtailed production.

Natural gas
Gas market 
Global gas prices weakened in 2024, leading to higher demand and 
hence a modest return to growth in global gas markets in 2024. But 
prices remained higher than the historical levels seen prior to the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine. The market remained volatile because of 
concerns about security of supply in Europe and limited new LNG 
supply. LNG supply increased by less than 3% in 2024, supporting 
relatively elevated pricing levels. The early part of 2024 saw spot LNG 
prices fall to their lowest level since early 2022, but prices recovered 
by mid-year due to delays in the development of new supply capacity.
Title Transfer Facility (TTF): In Europe, TTF spot prices averaged 
$10.95/MMBtu (17% lower year-on-year). Demand remained weak 
due to warmer than normal winter weather early in the year, continued 
lower demand from the industrial sector, and high levels of renewable 
power generation. As a result, European storage levels reached 
maximum fill levels by the end of October 2024 and entered the winter 
in a strong position. However, continued concerns over gas supply 
security because of geopolitical tensions resulted in a more volatile 
price environment in the fourth quarter of the year. Europe is expected 
to increase imports of LNG in 2025 to refill its gas storage.
Japan Korea Marker (JKM): Spot LNG prices in Asia closely tracked 
the market dynamics impacting the European market. JKM prices 
averaged $11.89 (14% lower year-on-year). Through the first three 
quarters of 2024, JKM prices traded at a premium to TTF as modest 
growth in Chinese and Indian demand drew cargoes east because of 
constrained LNG supply. With storage levels high in the fourth quarter, 
JKM prices fell below TTF as cargoes were pulled to Europe. 
Henry Hub: The North American gas market was well supplied in 
2024. Higher-than-expected power generation from wind and solar 
reduced the need for gas-fired power. Lower gas demand put 
downward pressure on Henry Hub spot prices to the extent that natural 
gas producers responded by curtailing production. Henry Hub spot hit 
a new all-time low of $1.24/MMBtu in March 2024 and then again in 
November at $1.22/MMBtu. Henry Hub spot averaged $2.2/MMBtu 
over 2024, with a wide range of $1.22/MMBtu to $13.20/MMBtu, 
with the high mark due to a short-lived January winter storm. In the 
summer, temperatures averaged 1.4°C higher than the 10-year norm. 
While this was bullish for gas power generation, it was offset by the 
impact of strong renewable generation. As such, natural gas storage 
ended the summer at a five-year high. For 2025, continued growth 
in renewable capacity coupled with higher dry gas production is 
expected to put downward pressure on natural gas prices.
Global gas prices are expected to remain volatile in 2025. Project 
delays and legacy production declines are likely to constrain supply 
growth. However, demand has also been bolstered by economic 
growth in Asia, the end of Russian gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine, 
and Europe's need to replenish inventories. Increased government 
intervention as well as geopolitical unrest continue to affect global 
LNG trade flows and price variance. 
Power
USA: In 2024, US power prices remained stable across most eastern 
markets compared with 2023. Henry Hub gas benchmark prices in 
North America were largely steady, staying below $3/MMBtu after 
a short-lived spike in January 2024. In the western USA, a cold start 
to the year drove Mid-Columbia prices to reach the $1,000/MWh 
soft cap multiple times in January, although the California Independent 
System Operator (CAISO) market was largely insulated from these 
fluctuations. The ERCOT (Texas) market set a new peak of 85.5 GW on 
August 20, 2024, but ERCOT successfully managed the high load with 
much lower prices compared with 2023. In the eastern USA, including 
PJM, MISO (Midcontinent), ISO-NE (New England) and NYISO, 
power prices remained stable relative to 2023. Solar and wind 
generation continued to grow and, depending on their market 
penetration levels, impacted the hourly price profiles. Continued 
growth in renewable energy demand is expected in 2025, driven 
by the expansion of data centres.
Europe: Across Europe, power prices continued to fall for the second 
year in a row from the height of the energy crisis in 2022. Germany, 
France, the United Kingdom and Spain saw a reduction of between 
EUR 20/MWh and 30/MWh in their annual average wholesale power 
prices in 2024, compared with 2023. This was partly due to depressed 
demand, more output from wind power generation in the winter months 
and record-setting solar power output in the summer. German power 
prices are still among the highest on the continent with an annual 
average of EUR 79/MWh. Germany is testing a new auction 
mechanism for excess power to be used by flexible loads as a means 
of managing the increasing number of negative price hours. More than 
32 GW of wind capacity was awarded by European governments in 
auctions this year. Nearly 10 GW of Europe's oldest remaining coal-
fired power stations were retired this year; the majority were retired in 
Germany, while the UK and Denmark closed their last coal plants. 
Power prices show an increasing dependence on solar and wind 
generation, reaching more than EUR 800/MWh during a period 
of very low solar and wind power generation in Germany in early 
November. In 2025, a policy shift towards economic competitiveness 
is likely, potentially paired with protectionist interventions in Europe. 
Issues such as operational flexibility and grid infrastructure are being 
addressed by, for example, increased battery investments and market 
changes, such as the transition to 15-minute trading intervals in all 
bidding zones of the European Single Day-Ahead Coupling market.
Australia: The volume-weighted average prices (VWAP) in the east 
coast National Electricity Market (NEM) averaged about A$130/
MWh in 2024, increasing from around A$90/MWh in 2023. The west 
coast Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) saw a more modest year-
on-year VWAP increase from roughly A$90/MWh to around A$95/
MWh. The VWAP of the east coast domestic gas markets (Brisbane, 
Sydney, Adelaide and the Declared Wholesale Gas Market (DWGM)) 
rose to around A$12.75/GJ in 2024 from around A$11.70/GJ 
in 2023. Meanwhile, in Western Australia the average gas price 
rose to around A$7.10/GJ in 2024 from about A$6.15/GJ in 2023. 
In addition to higher power prices, price volatility also increased 
compared with the previous year in both the NEM and WEM, largely 
due to increasing levels of rooftop solar generation which pushed 
network demand to record lows and led to prolonged periods 
of negative prices. In the NEM, cold weather, low wind and low 
hydroelectric generation in the second quarter and early third 
quarter put upward pressure on prices and led to greater reliance 
on gas-powered generation, increasing domestic gas demand. A key 
development to watch in 2025 is the outcome of the federal election, 
given the differing policies of the incumbent and opposition parties on 
the role of gas and power generation technologies.
Crude oil and natural gas price assumptions
Our ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial 
opportunities depends on the accuracy of our price assumptions. 
We use a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term 
market uncertainties to determine which ranges of future crude oil 
and natural gas prices to use in project and portfolio evaluations. 
Market uncertainties include, for example, future economic conditions, 
geopolitics, actions by major resource holders, production costs, 
technological progress and the balance of supply and demand.

Refining and chemical margins 
Refining margins declined in 2024 from the high levels seen in 2022 
and 2023. Despite conflicts in the Middle East and a continuing war 
in Ukraine, supply chains have adjusted to keep the Atlantic Basin well 
supplied, particularly with middle distillate to Europe. There were some 
shipping disruptions in the Red Sea at the start of 2024 which reduced 
the amount of oil products coming into Europe from East of Suez. This 
led to a spike in margins when combined with a heavy first-quarter 
refinery maintenance season in the Atlantic Basin. However, once the 
refineries came back online and supplies to Europe came in via the 
Cape of Good Hope, margins dropped to more normal levels. 
Moreover, demand growth has been limited with the Eurozone 
economy struggling, China's lower economic growth and muted 
growth in US gasoline demand.
The margin for 2025 is expected to be in line with 2024 levels. Oil 
product demand growth is likely to be weak and concentrated in Latin 
America, South-east Asia and India as economic growth is likely to 
remain sluggish in China and weak in Europe, and as electric vehicle 
penetration ramps up. New refinery capacity in India and China is still 
coming online and the major Atlantic Basin projects, Olemca (Mexico) 
and Dangote (Nigeria), will ramp up production in 2025 although 
neither site is expected to reach full capacity in 2025. Some support 
for refining margins will come from announced site closures in 
California, the US Gulf Coast and Europe. In addition, US gasoline 
stocks remain low and this could lead to a spike in margins if there 
is a supply disruption. Lower crude oil prices could also support 
more demand growth.
Chemical cracker margins remained pressured in 2024 because of 
global oversupply and weak demand. Asia and Europe saw slight relief 
with lower crude prices, but both regions remained under significant 
pressure. Cracker utilisation continued to drift lower with the start-up 
of new Asian capacity. Europe remained under strain with high energy 
costs as various producers, including LyondellBasell Industries (LB)I 
and Dow Inc., announced closures and portfolio reviews.
The outlook for petrochemical margins in 2025 and beyond depends 
on feedstock costs and the balance of supply and demand. Global 
oversupply is expected to persist through the year with a slow demand 
recovery. A recovery in demand is needed to absorb excess capacity. 
The supply of petrochemicals will depend on how new facilities come 
online and how plant closures will impact net capacity, with utilisation 
balancing the system. Product prices will reflect the cost of raw 
materials, which is closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Increasing volatility driven by political and upstream price uncertainty 
will present short-term localised opportunities to bolster returns.

Integrated Gas performed well as we increased LNG liquefaction 
volumes and our access to third-party volumes. We boosted our 
operational performance. In Australia, Prelude and QGC achieved 
record availability, resulting in their highest ever production. During 
the year, we extended partnerships in Oman and decided to invest 
in the ADNOC Ruwais LNG project in Abu Dhabi [A]. We also took 
final investment decisions on a number of key projects, including 
Manatee in Trinidad and Tobago, and agreed to acquire Pavilion 
Energy in Singapore [A]. See "Outlook" on pages 16-17 for our 
Capital Markets 2025 investor update.
Business conditions

overview" on pages 28-30.
Financial delivery
Earnings 2024-2023 
Segment earnings increased by $2,533 million compared with 
2023. This was a result of higher volumes (increase of $514 million), 
lower operating expenses (decrease of $478 million), and favourable 
deferred tax movements ($399 million) compared with 2023. 
Furthermore, this included the combined effect of lower contributions 
from trading and optimisation and lower realised prices (decrease of 
$3,819 million compared with 2023), partly offset by a comparative 
help relating to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives 
(unfavourable movement of $1,088 million in 2024 compared with 
an unfavourable movement of $4,407 million in 2023 which are 
part of identified items). Segment earnings in 2024 also included 
net impairment charges and reversals of $363 million 
(2023: $2,247 million), which are part of identified items.
As part of Shell's normal business, commodity derivative hedge 
contracts are entered into for mitigation of economic exposures 
on future purchases, sales and inventory.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings, and adjusted for identified items.
Prior year earnings summary
Segment earnings in 2023 were lower in comparison to 2022 and 
reflected the net effect of lower realised prices and higher contributions 
from trading and optimisation (a decrease of $1,143 million), lower 
volumes (a decrease of $466 million), and unfavourable deferred tax 
movements (a decrease of $728 million).
Segment earnings included identified items: mainly unfavourable 
movements of $4,407 million due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives and net impairment charges and reversals of 
$2,247 million. In 2022, identified items included favourable 
movements of $6,273 million due to the fair value accounting of 
commodity derivatives and net impairment reversals of $779 million. In 
2022, these were partly offset by other impacts of $608 million, mainly 
loan write-downs, as well as charges of $387 million as provisions for 
onerous contracts.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings, and adjusted for identified items.

the reporting segment changes applicable from 2024.
[C] Segment earnings, Adjusted Earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA are presented on a current 
cost of supplies basis. 
Cash flow from operating activities 
Cash flow from operating activities for 2024 was primarily driven by 
Adjusted EBITDA and working capital inflows of $467 million, partly 
offset by tax payments of $2,955 million and net cash outflows related 
to derivatives of $1,466 million.
Shell's policy is to settle the inter-segment use of tax attributes between 
business segments. This settlement is usually made in cash but in certain 
instances there is no cash settlement. In 2024, the Integrated Gas 
segment's deferred tax assets ($974 million) were mainly used by the 
Upstream ($759 million) and Chemicals and Products ($183 million) 
segments, for which no cash settlement was made.
Cash capital expenditure
Our cash capital expenditure in 2024 was higher than in 2023. The 
increase was mainly a result of maturation of projects in Trinidad and 
Tobago and Australia, as well as higher maintenance in Pearl GTL. Our 
cash capital expenditure* is expected to be around $6 billion in 2025 
in Integrated Gas.
Operational performance
Production available for sale 
Our natural gas production increased by 2% in 2024 compared 
with 2023, mainly due to the ramp-up of fields in Oman and Australia. 
In this period, natural gas and liquids made up 86% and 14% of total 
production, respectively.
LNG liquefaction and sales volumes
Our LNG liquefaction volumes increased by 3% compared with the 
previous year, mainly due to lower maintenance in Australia. 
LNG sales volumes decreased primarily because of lower purchases 
from third parties, coupled with higher inventory at the end of the year.

Portfolio and business developments 
Significant portfolio and business developments: 
￮In June 2024, we agreed to acquire 100% of the shares in 
Singapore-based Pavilion Energy Pte. Ltd. from Carne Investments 
Pte. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Temasek. Pavilion Energy 
includes a global LNG trading business with about 6.5 mtpa of 
contracted supply volume [A].
￮ In July 2024, we took the final investment decision (FID) on the 
Manatee project, a gas field in the East Coast Marine Area (ECMA) 
in Trinidad and Tobago.
￮ In July 2024, we signed an agreement to invest in the Abu Dhabi 
National Oil Company's (ADNOC) Ruwais LNG project through a 
10% participating interest [A]. The project will consist of two 4.8 
mtpa LNG liquefaction trains with a total capacity of 9.6 mtpa. LNG 
deliveries are expected to start in 2028.
￮ In August 2024, Arrow Energy, an incorporated joint venture 
between Shell (50%) and PetroChina (50%), announced the 
sanction of Phase 2 of Arrow Energy's Surat Gas Project in 
Queensland, Australia.
During 2024, we continued to grow our world-leading LNG business. 
We invested in our existing assets, for example taking a final 
investment decision on the Manatee gas project in Trinidad and 
Tobago and by going ahead with projects to supply gas at our LNG 
facilities in Australia, such as Surat Gas Project North.
Manatee is expected to start production in 2027 and, once online, is 
expected to reach peak production of about 104,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day (boe/d) (604 MMscf/d). It will provide backfill for 
the country's Atlantic LNG facility and to the petrochemical sector. 
Increasing utilisation at existing LNG plants is an important lever to 
maximise potential from Shell's existing assets. We also undertook the 
Phase 1 of the commercial restructuring of Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and 
Tobago in 2024 in an effort to simplify the structure of the project. The 
remaining phases are expected to be completed by 2027.

Shell completes its largest ever turnaround at Pearl GTL
In 2024, more than 16,000 workers converged on the Pearl GTL 
gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar to carry out maintenance and 
repair work over 56 days on Pearl GTL's Train 2 production line. 
The turnaround was completed on schedule and at a 
competitive cost – a clear example of how Shell, the operator, 
is focusing on performance and discipline as we implement 
our strategy.
Turnaround events, like this one, are planned, periodic 
shutdowns of a manufacturing facility for maintenance and 
repair work that cannot be conducted while the facility is fully 
operational. These events are crucial for maintaining the integrity 
and reliability of the facility. Throughout the turnaround, Pearl 
GTL's Train 1 remained operational, ensuring continuous supply 
of GTL products used by global customers in sectors from 
industry to transport.
Planning for the event started more than three years prior, and 
during the execution phase teams worked around the clock, 
making it a 24/7 event. The effective execution included nearly 
10,000 heavy lifts, more than 14,000 flanges opened, and 
2,700 field welds completed, resulting in over 9 million exposure 
hours with no significant incidents.
In recent years, Pearl GTL has been operating with high safety, 
reliability and availability performance. In 2024, Pearl achieved 
its second-best year for reliability with unplanned downtime at 
1.4%. In the same year, Pearl also achieved its lowest 
greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity since start-up and was the 
largest GHG abatement contributor to the Shell scorecard. 
Learning from the previous turnaround in 2022, Pearl GTL 
reduced flaring by approximately 19% during this event. 
Overall, Pearl GTL has reduced total flaring by 75% since 2016.
Despite the challenge of a turnaround this size, we continued to 
place a strong emphasis on worker welfare. This was a critical 
success factor in ensuring we had a healthy and focused team 
when it mattered most – on the job, at the point of risk.
This turnaround was conducted in close partnership with Qatar's 
state energy company – QatarEnergy. Collaborating and 
consulting during every phase of the project ensured successful 
completion, supporting reliable and safe future operations.

The Surat Gas Project Phase 2 is expected to contribute around 
22,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (or 130 million standard cubic 
feet per day) at peak production and first gas is expected in 2026. The 
gas from the project will flow to the Shell-operated Queensland Curtis 
LNG (QCLNG) facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-
term contracts and supply domestic customers.
We announced the investment in new projects such as Pavilion Energy 
in Singapore, which will add to our current sales and bring flexibility to 
our portfolio, as well as additional access to strategic gas markets in 
Asia and Europe. The 10-year LNG supply agreement that we signed 
with Boru Hatları ile Petrol Taşıma AŞ (BOTAS) of Turkey in 2024, will 
also increase the diversity and flexibility of our portfolio.
We also continued growing our portfolio through the construction of 
new lower-carbon intensity LNG plants, for example with the 
agreement to invest in the Ruwais LNG project that will use an 
electric-powered liquefaction system and has access to nuclear and 
solar power. The transaction is still subject to completion. 
Finally, in 2024, we made good progress at LNG Canada, the single 
largest private-sector energy investment in Canada's history. The facility 
is expected to initially export up to 14 million tonnes of LNG per 
annum, contributing up to 5.6 mtpa to Shell's global LNG supply 
portfolio. The project is on track to ship its first cargoes to global 
markets by the middle of 2025. LNG Canada has also been designed 
with energy-efficient natural gas turbines and is expected to use 
renewable power from an electric utility in the province of British 
Columbia.

We also have a 25% interest in the QatarEnergy LNG NFE(2) joint 
venture, which owns a 25% interest in the North Field East (NFE) 
project. Shell's ownership of NFE via the joint venture is 6.25%. In 
addition, we have a 25% interest in the QatarEnergy LNG NFS(2) joint 
venture which owns a 37.5% interest in the North Field South (NFS) 
project. Shell's ownership of NFS via the joint venture is 9.375%.
Russia
In 2022, Shell announced its intent to withdraw in a phased manner 
from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, 
petroleum products, gas and LNG. Shell still holds a 27.5% (minus one 
share) interest in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (SEIC), a 
Bermudan entity, which purportedly no longer holds any licences, rights 
and obligations in Sakhalin-2. Shell still holds one long-term LNG 
purchase contract with a Novatek entity.
Trinidad and Tobago
We have interests in three concessions with producing fields: Central 
Block (Shell interest 65%), North Coast Marine Area (Shell interest 
80.5%) and East Coast Marine Area (Shell interest 100%), where in 
July 2024 we took an FID on the Manatee project.
In 2024, we signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with 
Touchstone Exploration Trinidad Limited for the sale of our interest in 
the Central Block facility. We expect to complete this transaction in the 
first half of 2025.
We have a 100% interest in exploration blocks 5(c)REA, 5(d) and 6(d). 
We also have a 50% interest in exploration blocks 25a, 25b and 27 in

n Barbados, Colombia, Cyprus, Tanzania and 
Venezuela.
Trading and Optimisation
Our trading organisation markets and sells a portion of our share of 
equity production of LNG and third-party LNG through our UK, UAE 
and Singapore trading hubs. We have term sales contracts for most of 
our LNG liquefaction and term purchase contracts. Our shipping 
network, regasification terminals, and ability to buy and deliver spot 
cargoes from third parties enable us to optimise the income we 
generate from our LNG cargoes. For example, if a customer no longer 
needs a scheduled cargo, we can deliver it to another customer. 
Similarly, if a customer needs an additional cargo not available from 
our own production, we contract with third parties to deliver that 
cargo. We conduct paper trades, primarily to manage commodity 
price risk related to sales and purchase contracts.

Increasing natural 
gas and LNG 
production in 
Australia
We continue to grow our natural gas and liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) businesses in Queensland, Australia, by supplying 
increasing volumes of natural gas to the domestic market and 
LNG to customers in Asia.
Shell QGC (Shell interest between 44% and 74%) produces 
natural gas from wells drilled into coal seams in the Surat Basin. 
Extending across several thousand square kilometres, Shell QGC's 
operations span around 3,500 wells (gross), gas processing 
infrastructure and the two-train Shell-operated QCLNG facility 
on Curtis Island.
In 2024, QGC celebrated 10 years of LNG production 
and export by achieving its highest production levels ever. 
We also announced plans to develop Phase 2 of Arrow 
Energy's Surat Gas Project (Shell interest 50%, non-operated) 
in Queensland, which is expected to contribute around 22,400 
barrels of oil equivalent (130 million standard cubic feet) per day 
at peak production. First gas is expected in 2026. Gas from the 
project will flow to Shell's QCLNG facility to meet long-term 
contracts and supply domestic customers.
Long-term supplies of Australian LNG can help support the energy 
security and net-zero emission ambitions of countries in Asia. 
QCLNG has shipped more than 1,100 cargoes of LNG to 
customers since it began operating in 2014. The increase in 
production capacity at QGC and Arrow Energy will make a 
significant contribution to Shell's plan to grow its LNG business.
Shell QGC has long used advanced technology such as sensors, 
drones and satellites to detect potential methane leaks from its 
extensive infrastructure and improve emissions reporting. This 
has helped QGC reduce reported methane emissions by 70% 
compared with 2016. Shell's aim is to maintain methane emissions 
intensity for global operated oil and gas assets below 0.2%, 
which we met in 2024, and achieve near-zero methane emissions 
by 2030 [A].
Shell QGC contributes significantly to Australia's economy through 
the stable supply of gas for power generation, manufacturing and 
transport. It also supports local communities through employment 
programmes and initiatives, and provides educational support, skills 
development training and economic development assistance for 
First Nations people and communities. In 2024 alone, Shell QGC 
spent AUD 322 million with local suppliers in regional Queensland. 
1. Shell QGC is a leading natural gas producer in Queensland, Australia. 
QGC includes a two-train LNG facility (pictured), which produces LNG for 
international markets.
2. Staff at Shell QGC's training centre in Chinchilla, Queensland. Shell QGC 
has employed more than 400 apprentices and trainees in the past decade.

In 2024, Upstream delivered consistent performance through 
improved operations, cost reductions, portfolio optimisation and 
strategic investments. Our assets improved their availability and 
reliability, and we completed several major scheduled maintenance 
activities ahead of time, paving the way for higher production. We 
reached several milestones as part of our strategy to focus on high-
margin basins, including investments in projects like the Atapu-2 
field, which will increase our offshore production capacity in Brazil, 
and achieving first gas from Malaysia's Jerun field. We also took 
the final investment decision on the Vito waterflood project in the 
Gulf of America, and on Bonga North in the Gulf of Guinea — 
demonstrating how we can secure long-term value from existing 
assets. Our Whale platform, also in the Gulf of America, started 
production in January 2025 and is an example of how we are 
building on four decades of deep-water expertise and replicating 
innovative projects for more value. See "Outlook" on pages 16-17 
for our Capital Markets 2025 investor update.
Business conditions
For the business conditions relevant to Upstream, see "Market 
overview" on pages 28-30.
Financial delivery
Earnings 2024-2023
Segment earnings decreased by $768 million compared with 2023. This 
reflected unfavourable tax movements ($1,289 million), lower realised 
prices (a decrease of $949 million) and higher well write-offs (an increase 
of $541 million), partly offset by the comparative favourable impact of 
$962 million mainly relating to gas storage effects. Segment earnings in 
2024 also included a loss of $325 million related to the impact of the 
weakening Brazilian real on a deferred tax position, net impairment 
charges and reversals of $323 million and charges of $214 million 
related to redundancy and restructuring, partly offset by gains of $638 
million related to the impact of inflationary adjustments in Argentina on a 
deferred tax position. These charges and gains are part of identified items 
and compare with 2023, where segment earnings included net 
impairment charges and reversals of $642 million, and net charges of 
$295 million related to the impact of the weakening Argentine peso and 
strengthening Brazilian real on a deferred tax position.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings and adjusted for identified items.
Prior year earnings summary
Segment earnings, compared with 2022, mainly reflected lower 
realised oil and gas prices (decrease of $5,696 million) and lower 
volumes (decrease of $2,001 million).
Segment earnings in 2023 also included net impairment charges and 
reversals of $642 million, and net charges of $295 million, which related 
to the impact of the weakening Argentine peso and strengthening 
Brazilian real on a deferred tax position. These charges and gains are 
part of identified items and compare with 2022, where segment earnings 
included net impairment reversals and charges of $853 million, and 
charges of $1,385 million relating to the EU solidarity contribution and 
$802 million relating to the UK Energy Profits Levy.
Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA were driven by the same 
factors as the segment earnings and adjusted for identified items.

Cash flow from operating activities 
Cash flow from operating activities for 2024 was primarily driven by 
Adjusted EBITDA, partly offset by tax payments of $7,851 million and 
the timing impact of dividends (net of profits) from joint ventures and 
associates of $946 million.
Shell's policy is to settle the inter-segment use of tax attributes between 
business segments. This settlement is usually made in cash but in certain 
instances there is no cash settlement. In 2024, the Integrated Gas 
segment's deferred tax assets ($974 million) were mainly used by the 
Upstream ($759 million) and Chemicals and Products ($183 million) 
segments, for which no cash settlement was made. 
Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure in 2024 was lower compared with 2023. The 
decrease was mainly a result of projects ramp-up in the Gulf of America 
and Brazil in 2023. This was partially offset by higher spend from 
projects in Nigeria and the UK in 2024. Cash capital expenditure* is 
expected to be around $7 billion in 2025.
Operational performance 
Production available for sale
In 2024, liquids production was flat and natural gas production 
increased by 8%, compared with 2023.
Total production, compared with 2023, increased mainly due to new 
liquids and gas production, partly offset by field decline.
Strategic progress
Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business developments:
￮In May 2024, the Petrobras-operated Atapu consortium (Shell interest 
16.7%) announced a final investment decision (FID) for the Atapu-2

￮ In October 2024, we announced the start of production of the FPSO 
Marechal Duque de Caxias in the Mero field, in the pre-salt area of 
the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. Also known as Mero-3, the FPSO 
has an operational capacity of 180,000 barrels of oil per day (Shell 
share 19.3%).
￮ In December 2024, we, along with Equinor ASA, announced to 
combine our UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a 
new company which will be the UK North Sea's biggest independent 
producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will 
be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%). Completion of 
the transaction remains subject to approvals and is expected by the 
end of 2025.
￮ In December 2024, we announced a final investment decision (FID) on 
Bonga North, a deep-water project off the coast of Nigeria. Shell (55%) 
operates the Bonga field in partnership with Esso Exploration and 
Production Nigeria Ltd. (20%), Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd. (12.5%), 
and TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd. (12.5%), on 
behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.
￮ In January 2025, we announced the start of production at the Shell-
operated Whale floating production facility in the Gulf of America. 
The Whale development is owned by Shell (60%, operator) and 
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (40%).
￮ In February 2025, we announced production restart at the Penguins 
field in the UK North Sea with a modern floating, production, 
storage and offloading (FPSO) facility (Shell 50%, operator; NEO 
Energy 50%). The previous export route for this field was via the 
Brent Charlie platform, which ceased production in 2021 and is 
being decommissioned.
￮ In February 2025, we signed an agreement to acquire a 15.96% 
working interest from ConocoPhillips Company (COP) in the Shell-
operated Ursa platform in the Gulf of America. Shell's working 
interest in the platform, pipeline and associated fields will increase 
from around 45.39% to a maximum of 61.35%. The transaction is 
subject to regulatory and other conditions, and is expected to be 
completed by the end of the second quarter of 2025.
￮ On March 13, 2025, we completed the sale of The Shell Petroleum 
Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) to Renaissance.
Business and property
Our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are involved in all 
aspects of upstream activities. These activities include land tenure and 
the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas 
and natural gas liquids. They also include the marketing and 
transportation of oil and gas, as well as the operation of the 
infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market.
The conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which oil and 
gas interests are held vary from country to country. In almost all cases 
outside North America, legal agreements are generally granted by, or 
entered into with, a government, state-owned company, government-
run oil and gas company or agency. The exploration risk usually rests 
with the independent oil and gas company. In North America, these 
agreements may also be with private parties that own mineral rights. 
Of these agreements, the following are most relevant to our interests:
￮Licences (or concessions), which entitle the holder to explore for 
hydrocarbons and exploit any commercial discoveries. Under a 
licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and 
production activities, and is responsible for financing these activities. In 
principle, the licence holder is entitled to the totality of production less 
any royalties in kind. The government, state-owned company or 
government-run oil and gas company may sometimes enter into a joint 
arrangement as a participant, sharing the rights and obligations of the 
licence but usually without sharing the exploration risk. In a few cases, 
the state-owned company, government-run oil and gas company or 
agency has an option to purchase a certain share of production.
￮ Lease agreements, which are typically used in North America and 
are usually governed by terms similar to licences. Participants may 
include governments or private entities. Royalties are paid either in 
cash or in kind.
￮ Production-sharing contracts (PSCs) entered into with a government, 
state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company. PSCs 
generally oblige the independent oil and gas company, as 
contractor, to provide all the financing and bear the risk of 
exploration, development and production activities in exchange for 
a share of the production. Usually, this share consists of a fixed or 
variable part that is reserved for the recovery of the contractor's cost 
(cost oil). The remaining production is split with the government, 
state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company on a 
fixed or volume/revenue-dependent basis. In some cases, the 
government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas 
company will participate in the rights and obligations of the 
contractor and will share in the costs of development and 
production. Such participation can be across the venture or on a 
field-by-field basis. Additionally, as the price of oil or gas increases 
above certain predetermined levels, the independent oil and gas 
company's entitlement share of production normally decreases, and 
vice versa. Accordingly, its interest in a project may not be the same 
as its entitlement.
Europe
Germany
Shell is a 50% shareholder in BEB Erdgas und Erdoel GmbH & Co. 
KG (BEB), which owns interests in various concessions, mainly in 
Lower Saxony. ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH has a 
service contract with BEB, under which it provides operating services 
to BEB for most of the concessions.
Italy
Shell has a 39% interest in the Val d'Agri producing concession, 
operated by ENI S.p.A., and a 25% interest in the Tempa Rossa 
producing concession, operated by TotalEnergies EP Italia S.p.A.
Netherlands
Shell and ExxonMobil are 50:50 shareholders in Nederlandse 
Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM). NAM holds a 60% interest in the 
onshore low-calorific Groningen gas field (the remaining 40% interest 
is held by EBN, a Dutch government entity), the Schoonebeek oil 
field, some 25 smaller hydrocarbon production licences and two 
underground gas storage facilities.
Historical production from the Groningen field induces earthquakes 
which have led to damage claims, security concerns, and a 
strengthening operation to make buildings earthquake resistant.
In June 2018, NAM's shareholders and the Dutch government signed a 
Heads of Agreement (HoA) to inter alia reduce, and eventually cease, 
production from the Groningen field. Under the terms of the HoA, it 
was agreed that the Dutch government would pass on to NAM costs 
insofar as the costs corresponded to NAM's liability. Further 
agreements were signed to implement the HoA. Shell has put in place 
an appropriate security to fulfil its obligation under the HoA.
NAM is working with the Dutch government to fulfil its financial 
obligations for earthquake costs. These include compensating for 
damage caused by the earthquakes and paying to strengthen houses 
where this is required for safety. In 2022, NAM started arbitrations with 
the Dutch government to have its financial liability determined for the 
costs the Dutch government has charged to NAM in relation to the 
strengthening operation and the handling of claims for physical damage 
to property. The outcomes of these arbitrations are expected in 2025
.

On the instructions of the Dutch government, production at the 
Groningen field ceased on October 1, 2023, and a law was passed to 
shut down the field permanently from April 19, 2024. On July 18, 
2024, NAM signed an agreement to divest OneGas East, its offshore 
asset in the Dutch North Sea, to Tenaz Energy. The transaction is 
expected to be completed by mid-2025.
See Note 32 NAM (Groningen gas field) litigation in the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" on page 309.
Norway
Shell holds participating interests in 15 production licences on the 
Norwegian continental shelf, and is the operator of three of these. In 
2024, Shell was awarded one new licence, relinquished four licences 
and divested the Linnorm gas field. Shell has participating interests in 
two producing gas fields in Norway: Shell-operated Ormen Lange 
(Shell interest 17.8%) and Equinor-operated Troll (Shell interest 8.19%). 
In 2024, significant projects were executed at both assets. The Troll B 
and C platforms were partially electrified, which is expected to reduce 
annual emissions of CO2 by 250,000 tonnes. At Ormen Lange, subsea 
compression, powered from shore, is being installed to enhance gas 
recovery.
Additionally, Shell holds a 10% participating interest in the Irpa gas 
discovery, operated by Equinor, which is under development. We 
operate two licences which are being decommissioned: Knarr and 
Gaupe. We are also the technical service provider for the Nyhamna 
gas facility, operated by Gassco, which processes and exports gas 
from several Norwegian fields.
UK
Shell operates a number of assets on the UK continental shelf, mostly 
under unincorporated joint-venture agreements. Shell also has non-
operated positions in the West of Shetland area, including the Clair 
(Shell interest 27.97%) and Schiehallion (Shell interest 44.89%) fields, 
which are both operated by bp.
In December 2024, Shell, along with Equinor ASA, announced a 
combination of our UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to 
form a new company which will be the UK North Sea's biggest 
independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent 
producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%). 
Completion of the transaction remains subject to approvals and is 
expected by the end of 2025.
In April 2023, Shell restarted operations at the Pierce field (Shell interest 
92.5%) in the North Sea after a major redevelopment to enable gas 
production after years of the field producing only oil. The Haewene Brim 
floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, which 
produces from the Pierce field, was shut down between August 2023 
and April 2024 to allow completion of mooring lines integrity works. The 
FPSO vessel is fully operational and back in production.
The operated Penguins FPSO vessel (Shell interest 50%) was 
successfully moored in the northern North Sea in September 2024 with 
first oil in February 2025.
Victory (Shell interest 100%), a subsea tieback to the Total-operated 
Greater Laggan Area facilities, is on track for an expected start-up in 
2026. Priority work activities for 2024 were delivered ahead of 
schedule with new subsea pipelines installed in preparation for well 
execution in 2025.
Significant progress has also been made on the Jackdaw project (Shell 
interest 100%) in the North Sea and it is expected to become 
operational in the mid-2020s. On January 29, 2025, the Court of 
Session (Outer House) in Scotland ruled, in legal proceedings brought 
by the non-governmental organisation, Greenpeace, that the original 
consents for Jackdaw are no longer valid, though importantly, work on 
the project can continue while new consents are being sought. This 
ruling has not been appealed. 
Within Shell's UK exploration portfolio, there is an ongoing judicial 
review by Oceana UK challenging the award of tranche three of the 
33rd licensing round awards (including two licences awarded to Shell 
in the Mid-North Sea High area) which is expected to be heard by the 
High Court in March 2025.
In July 2024, Shell signed an agreement with RockRose Energy Limited, 
a subsidiary of Viaro Energy, to divest its equity stake in 11 gas fields 
and one exploration prospect in the UK Southern North Sea, as well as 
the onshore gas processing terminal in Bacton, England. The sale is 
subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in 2025.
In July 2023, the UK government announced that the Acorn carbon 
capture, utilisation and storage project (Shell interest 30%) had been 
selected as one of two clusters to enter Track 2 of the UK's cluster 
sequencing process for carbon capture and storage (CCS). In 2024, 
Shell had expected to start more detailed discussions about the project 
with the UK government, but these have not yet commenced in earnest.
The Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning 
(OPRED) continues to assess the Brent Field decommissioning 
programme for the Brent gravity-based substructures. The Brent Charlie 
topside was lifted and transported to shore in July 2024.
Decommissioning of the Heather A platform and Curlew FPSO asset 
continued in 2024. Shell is also continuing with the campaign of 
subsea well plug and abandonment activity to decommission 25 wells 
in the Central North Sea which began in 2023.
Rest of Europe
Shell also has interests in Albania.
Asia (including the Middle East)
Brunei
Shell and the Brunei government are 50:50 shareholders in Brunei 
Shell Petroleum Company Sendirian Berhad (BSP). BSP has long-term 
onshore and offshore oil and gas concession rights and sells most of its 
gas production to Brunei LNG Sendirian Berhad, with the remainder 
sold in the domestic market.
In addition to our interest in BSP, we have a non-operated 35% 
interest in the offshore Block B concession, which is operated by 
Hibiscus Petroleum. The gas and condensate are produced from the 
Maharaja Lela field.
We have a non-operated 20% interest under a PSC in a gas-holding 
area for deep-water Block CA2, which is operated by Petronas.
We operate the deep-water Block CA1 (Shell interest 86.95%) in which 
the Jagus East field is located and forms part of the unitised GKGJE 
field under a PSC. As referred to in the Malaysia section the unitised 
GKGJE field is operated by Shell Malaysia.
See "Integrated Gas" on pages 31-37.
Iraq
Shell has a 44% interest in the Basrah Gas Company, which gathers, 
treats and processes associated gas that was previously flared from 
the Rumaila, West Qurna 1 and Zubair fields. Processed gas and

Karachaganak Expansion Project 1A completed
Karachaganak is one of the world's largest gas and condensate 
fields. It produces around 260,000 barrels of oil and 
condensate per day, which are processed by Karachaganak 
Petroleum Operating B.V. (KPO) for export. Shell is the joint 
operator, along with Eni, of the Karachaganak field (Shell 
interest 29.3%).
In 2024, KPO completed the Karachaganak Expansion Project 
1A (KEP1A) to maintain production levels and extend the field's 
long productive life by reinjecting gas into the reservoir through 
a new fifth gas compressor. Around 7,000 local people were 
employed during construction.
The project was completed one month ahead of schedule, after 
starting in December 2020, and was delivered within budget. 
This success can be attributed to the resilience of the team who 
worked hard to achieve the result, despite the disruption caused 
by the COVID-19 pandemic and the nearby Russia‒Ukraine war.
KEP1A is a key example of Shell's focus on performance and 
discipline.
KPO is now working on the installation of a sixth gas reinjection 
compressor as part of Karachaganak Expansion Project 1B to 
maintain pressure in the reservoir and keep production levels 
stable. The project is scheduled for completion in 2026.

Kazakhstan
Shell is the joint operator with ENI S.p.A. of the onshore Karachaganak 
oil and condensate field (Shell interest 29.3%) in north-west 
Kazakhstan which covers more than 280 square kilometres.
We also have a 16.8% interest in the North Caspian Sea PSA, which 
includes the Kashagan field in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea. 
The North Caspian Operating Company is the operator. This shallow-
water field covers around 3,400 square kilometres.
Shell has a 7.4% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), 
which owns and operates an oil pipeline running from the Caspian 
Sea to the Black Sea across parts of Kazakhstan and Russia. We hold 
our interest in the CPC via three legal entities. Two of these are wholly 
owned by Shell and the other is a joint venture with Rosneft, Rosneft-
Shell Caspian Ventures Ltd (Cyprus) (RSCV) (Shell interest 49%), 
which was formed in 1996 to own and manage pipeline capacity 
rights. We continue to manage our interest in CPC held through RSCV 
in full compliance with applicable laws, including sanctions.
We have several matters in dispute involving non-operated ventures and 
the Republic of Kazakhstan, including court proceedings in respect of a 
sulphur permitting outcome and two arbitrations under the applicable 
production-sharing agreements. There remains a high degree of 
uncertainty regarding the outcomes, as well as the potential effect on 
future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
See Note 32 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 308-310.
Kuwait
Shell Kuwait Exploration and Production B.V. (Shell interest 100%)

Kakap Geronggong-Jagus East (GKGJE) field in the Block J PSC which 
straddles the Malaysia-Brunei border (Shell interest 37.89%).
We hold a 50% operated participating interest in exploration phase 
Block 2W, Block X, Block ND6 and Block ND7 PSCs. Our exploration 
activities in Block ND6 and Block ND7 PSCs were suspended in 2005 
because of Malaysia's border disputes with Indonesia.
Our non-operated portfolio includes two producing fields: the unitised 
Siakap North-Petai deep-water field in Block G PSC (Shell interest 
21%) and the Kebabangan Cluster PSC (Shell interest 30%). We also 
hold interests in exploration phase Block SB 2K, Block N and Block 
2V PSCs, which range from 25.1% to 40%. In 2024, we signed a new 
non-operated PSC for Ubah Cluster, a deep-water project off the 
coast of Sabah (Shell interest 35%).
Offshore Sarawak
We are the operator of four PSCs producing gas and oil, holding 
interests ranging from 30% to 75% under the MLNG, SK308, SK408 
and SK318 PSCs. Nearly all the gas produced offshore Sarawak is 
supplied to Malaysia LNG (MLNG) and to our gas-to-liquids plant in 
Bintulu. We also continue to explore in the MLNG PSC.

produced from Block 6 through its interest in Private Oil Holdings 
Oman Ltd. The government of Oman has a 60% interest in PDO and 
the Block 6 oil concession through its wholly owned company, Energy 
Development Oman (EDO). PDO operates a concession area of about 
90,000 square kilometres and has more than 200 producing oil fields.
We have a 50% interest in Block 42 under an exploration and 
production-sharing agreement (EPSA) where Shell is the operator. We 
also operate in Block 55 under an EPSA (Shell interest 100%). We are 
in the process of relinquishing our interests in Block 42 and Block 55 to 
the government.
See "Integrated Gas" on pages 31-37.
Syria
Shell holds a 65% interest in Syria Shell Petroleum Development B.V. 
(SSPD), a joint venture between Shell and the China National Petroleum 
Corporation. SSPD holds a 31.25% interest in Al Furat Petroleum 
Company, a Syrian joint stock company whose role was to perform 
petroleum operations. Shell also holds a 70% interest in two exploration 
licences via Shell South Syria Exploration B.V. In December 2011, in 
compliance with international sanctions on Syria, including European 
Council Decision 2011/782/CFSP, Shell suspended all exploration and 
production activities in Syria as well as its participation and/or support in 
activities related to Al Furat Petroleum Company. SSPD continued to fulfil 
minimum contractual obligations towards the Syrian finance and labour 
ministries, in compliance with applicable trade control laws. In 2024, as 
part of the minimum contractual obligations, payments for taxes related 
to salary and social security amounted to $282. In addition, in 2024, in 
compliance with applicable sanctions on Syria, we reimbursed an 
employee $713.05 for the renewal of his and his son's Syrian passport, 
which was paid to the Syrian Embassy in Kuwait.
Rest of Middle East and Asia
Shell has certain interests in the United Arab Emirates including a 15% 
shareholding in the Abu Dhabi Gas Industries Limited ("ADNOC Gas 
Processing") operating joint venture which is a key supplier of natural 
gas in the country.
Africa
Nigeria
In 2024, Shell operated a number of interests in onshore and offshore 
oil exploration and production assets in Nigeria.
See "Risk factors" on pages 138.
Onshore
The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) 
is the operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV, Shell interest 30%) 
which has 15 Niger Delta onshore oil mining leases (OMLs) and three 
shallow-water leases (OML 74, 77 and 79).
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance. 
As part of the transaction and ongoing business arrangements, Shell 
provided loan facilities for amounts up to $2.5 billion. Shell will 
continue to support Renaissance in the development of its gas reserves 
and retain an interest in the performance of the export feedgas 
business.
Offshore
Our main offshore deep-water activities are carried out by our wholly 
owned subsidiary Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company 
Limited (SNEPCo). SNEPCo has interests in three deep-water blocks 
that are under PSC terms: the producing assets Bonga (OML 118) and 
Erha (OML 133), and the non-producing asset Bolia Chota (OML 135). 
SNEPCo operates OML 118 (Shell interest 55%), including the Bonga 
field FPSO vessel. We also operate OML 135 (Shell interest 55%), 
encompassing the Bolia and Doro fields. We have a 43.8% non-
operated interest in OML 133 (including the Erha FPSO). In addition, 
SNEPCo holds a 40% interest in a non-producing shallow-water lease 
(OML 144) that is held in a joint venture with Sunlink Energies. 
In December 2024, we announced a final investment decision (FID) on 
Bonga North (OML 118), a deep-water project off the coast of Nigeria.
Authorities have investigated our involvement in the 2011 settlement 
of litigation pertaining to OPL 245. In January 2020, criminal charges 
alleging disobeying direction of law related to tax waivers were filed 
in Nigeria against Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Ltd., SNEPCO, and third 
parties including Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (NAE). In March 
2024, the Court approved the defendant's no-case submission and 
dismissed the charges against all defendants.
See Note 32 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 308-310 for more 
information about OPL 245.
Business update
Security issues, sabotage and crude oil theft in the Niger Delta 
continued and remained significant challenges to our onshore 
operations in 2024. We will continue to monitor the situation closely 
and evaluate implications for the integrity of our infrastructure and the 
sustainability of our current operations. We continue to put the safety 
of our employees and contractors first.
In our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse 
conditions which could have a significant adverse effect on our 
operational performance, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
See "Respecting nature" on pages 109-113.

There are limitations to the extent to which we can mitigate these risks. 
We monitor the security situation and liaise with host communities, and 
governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote 
peaceful and safe operations for our people and local communities. 
We test the economic and operational resilience of our Nigerian 
projects against a range of assumptions and scenarios. When we 
participate in joint ventures in Nigeria, we require that they operate in 
accordance with good industry practice. We seek to proportionally 
share risks and funding commitments with joint-venture partners. As a 
result of the completion of the sale of SPDC, our exposure to the risks 
arising from onshore operations is expected to reduce. Shell has other 
businesses in Nigeria that are outside the scope of the announced 
transaction.
See "Risk factors" on page 138.
We support the Nigerian government's efforts to improve the efficiency, 
functionality and domestic benefits of Nigeria's oil and gas industry. 
We report spills and how we respond to spills, including those that are 
caused by third-party interference. We implement a maintenance 
strategy to support sustainable equipment reliability and we have a 
multi-year programme to reduce routine flaring of associated gas.
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 95.
Rest of Africa
Shell also has interests in Algeria, Namibia, São Tomé and Príncipe, 
South Africa and Tunisia.
In 2021, Shell announced plans to hand back upstream assets 
associated with the Miskar and Hasdrubal concessions to the 
government of Tunisia. In June 2022, Shell handed back the Miskar 
concession upon its expiry. Discussions are ongoing with the 
competent authorities for the hand-back/relinquishment of Hasdrubal 
concession. 
North America 
USA
The majority of our oil and gas interests in the USA comprise leases 
for federal offshore blocks in the deep waters of the Gulf of America. 
Such leases usually have a fixed primary term and, once production 
is established, remain in effect through continued production, subject 
to compliance with the relevant terms and provisions (including 
applicable laws and regulations).
In 2024, we relinquished our interest in one licence in the North Slope 
area of Alaska.
Gulf of America
Shell's major production area in the USA is the Gulf of America. We 
have a total of 304 active federal offshore leases where Shell is the 
operator, and 62 active federal offshore leases where Shell has a 
non-operated interest.
We are the operator of 10 production hubs: Mars (Shell interests 
33.7% to 100%), Olympus (Shell interests 71.5% to 100%), Auger 
(Shell interests 27.5% to 100%), Perdido (Shell interests 33.3% to 
40%), Ursa (Shell interests 45.4% to 100%), Enchilada/Salsa (Shell 
interests 37.5% to 75%), Appomattox (Shell interests 79% to 80%), 
Vito (Shell interest 63.1%), Stones (Shell interest 100%) and Whale 
(Shell interest 60%). We also have an interest in the West Delta 143 
offshore processing facilities (Shell interest 71.5%).
We continue to produce from the Coulomb field (Shell interest 100%), 
which ties into the Na Kika platform (Shell interest 50%) and which is 
co-owned and operated by BP Exploration and Production Inc.
We continued exploration, development and decommissioning 
activities in the Gulf of America in 2024.
In February 2024, we began production at Rydberg (Shell interest 
80%), a subsea tie-back to the Shell-operated Appomattox production 
hub (Shell interest 79%). Rydberg is expected to produce up to 16,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) at peak rates expected 
between September 2025 to January 2026.
In August 2024, an FID was taken on a waterflood project at Vito 
where water will be injected into the reservoir formation to displace 
additional oil. The process is due to begin in 2027 and is expected to 
enhance volume capacity at the Vito field.
In December 2024, FID was announced on a Phase 3 Silvertip project, 
which will deliver two wells to boost production at the Shell-operated 
Perdido spar. These wells, located in the Silvertip Frio reservoir (Shell 
interest 40%), are expected to collectively produce up to 6,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) at peak rates. First production is 
expected in 2026.
In January 2025, we began production at the Shell-operated Whale 
stand-alone host (Shell interest 60%). Whale is expected to produce 
up to 100,000 boe/d at peak rates in 2027. 
In February 2025, we signed an agreement to acquire a 15.96% 
working interest from ConocoPhillips Company (COP) in the Shell-
operated Ursa platform in the Gulf of America. Shell's working interest 
in the platform, pipeline and associated fields will increase from around 
45.39% to a maximum of 61.35%. The transaction is subject to 
regulatory and other conditions, and is expected to be completed by 
the end of the second quarter of 2025.

Whale produces 
first oil in the Gulf 
of America
The simplified and cost-efficient Whale platform started oil 
production in the Gulf of America in January 2025. Whale, 
operated by Shell, has an estimated peak production of 100,000 
barrels of oil equivalent per day -- enough to fuel the daily journeys 
of 2.7 million cars in the USA. 
Whale is a close replica of the Shell-operated Vito platform, which 
started production in the Gulf of America in early 2023. Vito is 
significantly smaller than its original design, resulting in lower costs 
and emissions. Whale will operate with around 30% lower carbon 
intensity over its life cycle than Vito.
Investments in oil and gas platforms such as Whale are needed to 
meet the world's energy demand while low-carbon alternatives are 
developed and made commercially available. Energy companies 
like Shell are finding ways to produce oil and gas with lower 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Power turbines are one of the biggest producers of emissions on 
offshore platforms. To reduce emissions on Whale, engineers have 
fitted waste-heat recovery units to all its power turbines. These units 
capture energy that would otherwise be lost to the atmosphere. 
This energy is then reused to heat the raw fluids so they can be 
exported from the platform.
The process of compressing gas before it is exported to the shore 
is another contributor to emissions on offshore facilities. To reduce 
these emissions on Whale, engineers have installed compressors 
which use less energy than a typical system.
Most of Whale's operations can be managed from New Orleans, 
which is about 600 kilometres away from the platform. Engineers 
use virtual reality headsets to carry out checks. They also deploy 
drones to inspect other areas, keeping the number of people 
needed on the platform to a minimum.
Whale has been designed to hold just 60 people, compared with 
the 180 people that can live on the Shell-operated Appomattox 
platform in the Gulf of America, which started production in 2019. 
Weighing around 25,000 tonnes, Whale is a third of the weight of 
Appomattox. The smaller scale helped designers to cut the cost of 
building the facility.
The Whale development is owned by Shell Offshore Inc. (60%) 
and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (40%) and lies 320 kilometres south 
of Houston. 
1. The Shell-operated Whale platform has a smaller footprint and lower carbon 
intensity over its life cycle than earlier platforms.
2. Whale is controlled by remote from New Orleans, some 600 km away. 
With just 60 people on board and a simplified, more energy-efficient design, 
Whale is reducing costs and emissions.

[C] On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of its Nigerian onshore subsidiary The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) which holds a 30% interest in the 
SPDC JV to Renaissance. As of December 31, 2024, Shell had proved reserves of 453 million boe in SPDC.
[D] Pursuant to Shell's 2017 agreement with Canadian Natural Resources Limited, its remaining mining interest and associated synthetic crude oil reserves will be swapped for an additional 10% 
interest in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest CCS project. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The associated proved 
reserves as of December 31, 2024 were 741 million barrels (of which 50% attributable to non-controlling interest).
[E] On December 5, 2024, Shell and Equinor ASA, announced the combination of their UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North Sea's 
biggest independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%) and 157 million boe (as of December 31, 2024) 
of Shell's proved reserves will be contributed to the new joint venture alongside proved reserves contributed by Equinor. Subsequently, Shell will report 50% of the proved reserves of the new 
joint venture as part of Shell's share of proved reserves from joint ventures and associates.

Proved reserves
Before taking production into account, our proved reserves increased 
by 917 million boe in 2024. This consisted of an increase of 870 million 
boe from Shell subsidiaries and an increase of 47 million boe from the 
Shell share of joint ventures and associates. After taking production 
into account, our proved reserves decreased by 167 million boe in 
2024 to 9,620 million boe at December 31, 2024.
Shell subsidiaries
Before taking production into account, Shell subsidiaries' proved 
reserves increased by 870 million boe in 2024. This consisted of an 
increase of 521 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, 
an increase of 346 million boe (2,008 thousand million scf) of natural 
gas and an increase of 3 million barrels of synthetic crude oil. The 
870 million boe increase comprised an increase of 394 million boe 
from extensions and discoveries, a net increase of 381 million boe 
from revisions and reclassifications, an increase of 49 million boe 
from improved recovery and a net increase of 46 million boe 
related to purchases and sales of minerals in place.
After taking into account production of 997 million boe (of which 41 
million boe were consumed in operations), Shell subsidiaries' proved 
reserves decreased by 127 million boe in 2024 to 8,156 million boe. In 
2024, Shell subsidiaries' proved developed reserves (PD) increased by 
25 million boe to 6,346 million boe and proved undeveloped reserves 
(PUD) decreased by 152 million boe to 1,810 million boe.
Shell share of joint ventures and associates
Before taking production into account, the Shell share of joint ventures 
and associates' proved reserves increased by 47 million boe in 2024. 
This consisted of an increase of 52 million boe (297 thousand million 
scf) of natural gas, and a decrease of 5 million barrels of crude oil and 
natural gas liquids. The 47 million boe increase comprised an increase 
of 26 million boe from extensions and discoveries and a net increase 
of 21 million boe from revisions and reclassifications.
After taking into account production of 87 million boe (of which 5 
million boe were consumed in operations), the Shell share of joint 
ventures and associates' proved reserves decreased by 40 million 
boe to 1,464 million boe at December 31, 2024.
The Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PD increased by 
9 million boe to 517 million boe, and PUD decreased by 49 million 
boe to 947 million boe.
See "Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited)" on pages 313-332 for more 
information about proved oil and gas reserves of Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share of 
the proved oil and gas reserves of joint ventures and associates.
Proved undeveloped reserves
In 2024, Shell subsidiaries' and the Shell share of joint ventures and 
associates' PUD decreased by 201 million boe to 2,757 million boe. 
There were decreases of 617 million boe as a result of maturation to 
PD, mainly 305 million boe in Kashagan (Kazakhstan), 65 million boe 
in Mero (Brazil), 38 million boe in Mabrouk North-East (Oman), and 
209 million boe spread across other fields and a net decrease of 71 
million boe as a result of revisions, reclassifications and entitlement 
changes, which were mainly because of the decrease of 137 million 
boe in Groundbirch due to low average Alberta Energy Company 
(AECO) prices in 2024, an increase of 102 million boe due to an FID 
on an additional FPSO in Atapu, Brazil, and a decrease of 36 million 
spread across other fields. These were offset by an increase of 7 million 
boe due to de-maturation of PD to PUD, an increase of 420 million boe 
due to extensions and discoveries, mainly 286 million boe in Manatee 
(T&T), and 134 million boe spread across other fields, an increase 
of 49 million boe due to improved recovery, and a net increase 
of 11 million boe due to purchases and sales of minerals in place.
In addition to the maturation of 617 million boe from PUD to PD, 
61 million boe were matured to PD as through PUD as a result of 
project execution during the year.
PUD held for five years or more (PUD5+) on December 31, 2024, 
amounted to 138 million boe, a decrease of 74 million boe compared 
with the end of 2023. The decrease in PUD5+ during 2024 was 
driven mainly by changes in Tupi (Brazil), Gbaran (Nigeria) and 
Kolo Creek (Nigeria).
The fields with the largest PUD5+ on December 31, 2024, were Assa 
North (Nigeria) and Penguins (UK). These PUD5+ remain undeveloped 
because of delays in drilling operations and security incidents impacting 
facility construction (Nigeria) and due to project delays (UK).
During 2024, we spent $8.2 billion on development activities related 
to PUD maturation. 
Delivery commitments
We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under 
a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit 
us to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, 
although some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed 
and determinable quantities, as discussed below.
In the past three years, we met our contractual delivery commitments, 
with the notable exceptions of Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, and 
Malaysia. The delivery commitments for Egypt and Trinidad and 
Tobago have been renegotiated. In the period 2025-2027, we are 
contractually committed to deliver to third parties, joint ventures and 
associates a total of some 4,945 billion scf of natural gas from our 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. The sales contracts contain 
a mixture of fixed and variable pricing formulae that are generally 
referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas 
or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. 
In the period 2025-2027, we expect to meet our delivery commitments 
for almost all the areas in which they are carried, with an estimated 
74% coming from PD, 4% through the delivery of gas that becomes 
available to us from paying royalties in cash, and 22% from the 
development of PUD as well as other new projects and purchases. In 
Malaysia Sabah, one of the third-party gas supply lines remains non-
operational. New contracts for Domestic and LNG Markets were 
agreed and signed in 2024, resulting in no shortfall in the period 
2025-2027.

Exploration
Shell continues to explore for and mature hydrocarbons across our 
Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses. Exploration may result in 
discoveries of oil and gas that we can develop, helping maintain 
energy security and contributing to our strategy.
We use our integrated exploration, development and project 
commercial and technical expertise to mature these opportunities and 
actively manage non-technical risks. We benchmark our projects 
internally and externally to make sure our proposals are competitive. 
We review the maturation progress of our various opportunities and 
perform post-investment reviews to extract learnings for implementation 
in future opportunities. 
In 2024, hydrocarbons were found in Brunei, Oman and the Gulf of 
America.
Key exploration portfolio developments
UK
The UK government ratified 13 licences that we were awarded in the 
33rd Offshore Licensing Round (Shell interests 50% to 100%), of which 
three are non-operated (Shell interests 50%). We relinquished two 
Shell-operated licences (Shell interests 70% and 100%), and one non-
operated licence (Shell interest 33%). We also acquired an additional 
15% interest in two licences, bringing our interest in each to 65%.

Our Marketing business grew as a result of higher margins in 
fuels and lubricants as we focused on high-value customers and 
profitable market segments. We have been the leading finished 
lubricants supplier in the world for 18 years, according to Kline 
& Company data for 2023. Mobility continued to focus on key 
markets and we completed the sale of Shell Pakistan. We have also 
installed more than 70,000 electric vehicle public charge points 
globally achieving yet another aim one year ahead of schedule. 
As an example of our focus on discipline, we have paused on-site 
construction work at our planned biofuels facility in Rotterdam 
to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness. See 
"Outlook" on pages 16-17 for our Capital Markets 2025 investor 
update.

Earnings 2024-2023
Segment earnings decreased by $1,163 million compared with 2023. 
This reflected higher Marketing margins (increase of $483 million) 
including higher unit margins in Lubricants and Mobility. This was partly 
offset by lower Sectors and Decarbonisation margins. Segment earnings 
also reflected lower operating expenses (decrease of $449 million). 
These were partly offset by unfavourable tax movements ($157 million) 
and higher depreciation charges (increase of $142 million). The 2024 
segment earnings also included net impairment charges and reversals of 
$1,423 million, mainly related to an asset in the Netherlands, net losses 
of $386 million related to the sale of assets and charges of $215 million 
related to redundancies and restructuring. These charges are part of 
identified items and compare with the full year 2023, which included 
net impairment charges and reversals of $466 million, and charges 
of $113 million related to redundancies and restructuring, partly 
offset by gains of $298 million related to indirect tax credits.
Adjusted Earnings increased by $573 million, compared with 2023, 
as a result of the following: 
￮Mobility (including wholesale commercial fuels) Adjusted Earnings 
were $392 million higher, mainly as a result of higher unit margins 
and lower operating expenses. This was partly offset by higher 
depreciation and higher taxes; 
￮ Lubricants Adjusted Earnings were $329 million higher, mainly 
because of higher margins; and
￮ Sectors and Decarbonisation Adjusted Earnings were $148 million 
lower, mainly because of lower earnings in joint ventures partly 
offset by lower operating expenses. 
Prior year earnings summary 
Segment earnings in 2023 were 33% higher than in 2022, reflecting 
higher margins (increase of $1,482 million), including higher unit 
margins in Mobility, higher margins in Lubricants because of lower 
feedstock costs, and higher volumes in Sectors and Decarbonisation. 
These increases were partly offset by higher operating expenses 
(increase of $730 million) and higher depreciation charges 
(increase of $267 million), mainly due to asset acquisitions.

Segment earnings in 2023 included impairment charges of 
$466 million and charges of $113 million related to redundancy and 
restructuring, partly offset by gains of $298 million related to indirect 
tax credits. These charges and gains are part of identified items and 
compare with 2022, which included net impairment charges and 
reversals of $321 million; net losses of $122 million related to the sale 
of assets; and provisions for onerous contracts of $62 million. 
Adjusted Earnings increased by $407 million compared with 2022, 
as a result of the following: 
￮Mobility (including wholesale commercial fuels) Adjusted Earnings 
were $73 million lower, mainly as a result of higher operating 
expenses and higher depreciation. This was partly offset by better 
margins; 
￮ Lubricants Adjusted Earnings were $339 million higher, mainly 
because of higher margins due to lower feedstock costs; and
￮ Sectors and Decarbonisation Adjusted Earnings were $141 million 
higher, mainly because of increased volumes and higher earnings 
in joint ventures.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities in 2024 was primarily driven 
by Adjusted EBITDA, working capital inflows of $998 million, 
and dividends (net of profits) from joint ventures and associates 
of $262 million. These inflows were partly offset by tax payments 
of $562 million, non-cash cost of supplies adjustment of $254 million, 
and outflows from the timing impact of $221 million in payments 
related to emission certificates and biofuel programmes.
Cash capital expenditure 
Cash capital expenditure* of $2.4 billion in 2024 reflected $0.8 billion 
in low-carbon energy solutions, compared with $3.3 billion in 2023. 
Cash capital expenditure in low-carbon energy solutions was higher 
in 2023, mainly due to the acquisition of Nature Energy and the 
expansion of our Mobility electric vehicle charging business. 
Our cash capital expenditure* is expected to be in the range of $2-3 
billion in 2025.

Operational performance
Marketing sales 
Marketing sales volumes, which comprise hydrocarbon sales, 
decreased compared with 2023. This was mainly as a result of reduced 
sales volumes in Mobility because of our focus on value over volume.
Number of electric vehicle charge points
In 2024, the number of electric vehicle charge points owned or Shell- 
branded was almost 73,000 compared with 54,000 in 2023. 
Strategic progress
Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business developments:
￮In July 2024, we announced that we had paused on-site construction 
work at the biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rotterdam in the Netherlands to assess the most commercial way 
forward for the project.
Business and property
Mobility
Shell Mobility is where we connect with individual customers on a 
personal level. Shell Mobility is one of the world's largest mobility 
retailers by number of sites, with more than 44,000 Shell-branded 
mobility sites, including service stations, in more than 80 markets at the 
end of 2024. We operate different models across these markets, from 
full ownership of sites to brand licensing agreements. In line with our 
strategy to focus on markets that provide high returns on investment, 
we are continuing with our plan to divest around 500 low-return Shell-
owned sites (including joint ventures) each year until 2025. The sale 
of Shell Pakistan in 2024 has helped us achieve our aim.
Every day, around 33 million retail customers visit Shell-branded 
mobility sites for a range of quality fuels, electric vehicle charging, and 
convenience and non-fuel products and services. Through Shell Fleet 
Solutions, our business customers can obtain fuel cards, road services 
and carbon-offset offers, among other products and services. 
We are expanding our convenience and non-fuel retail offer to cater to 
our customers' needs. At many of our sites, we offer convenience items, 
including beverages and fresh food, and services, such as lubricant 
changes and car washes. At the end of 2024, Shell operated 13,000 
convenience stores worldwide. We have upgraded more than 2,500 
stores with our Shell Café premium fresh coffee and food offer since 
launching in 2021. 
Low-carbon products and services
Shell Mobility offers customers lower-emission products and services, 
including biofuels and electric vehicle charging. We are focusing on 
growing our presence in China, Europe and the USA. At the end of 
2024, we had almost 73,000 public charge points globally at Shell 
forecourts, on-street locations, mobility hubs and other sites, such as 
supermarkets. This was an increase from around 54,000 at the end of 
2023. As part of our value over volume focus, we no longer set a 
volumetric target for the number of charge points by 2030.
Shell's global electric vehicle charging business is not yet profitable. 
However, we remain committed to investing in this sector as we 
anticipate future profitability. The timeline and extent of this profitability 
will be influenced by factors, such as network accessibility, market 
competition, customer demand, advancements in cost-related 
technologies and supportive government policies. 
As we work to provide more low-carbon alternatives to our customers, 
we also continue to develop traditional fuels for drivers of internal 
combustion engine vehicles. Aided by our partnership with Scuderia 
Ferrari, we have concentrated on developing fuels with special 
formulations designed to clean engines and improve performance. 
An example of this is Shell V-Power. We sold fuels under the Shell
V-Power brand in 72 markets in 2024. 
Partnering with Ferrari in motorsport
We are the lead technical partner to the Scuderia Ferrari F1™ 
team, with the partnership being one of the longest and most 
successful in motorsport. The partnership is the ultimate test bed 
for our products, challenging them to perform in some of the most 
extreme conditions and ensuring our customers are getting the 
very best. In October 2024, a multi-year renewal was announced. 
Taking effect on January 1, 2026, the partnership will encompass 
Scuderia Ferrari HP, Ferrari Hypercar and the Ferrari Challenge 
Series. We are helping to shape the future of fuels by supporting 
Scuderia Ferrari with the development of an advanced sustainable 
race fuel for the 2026 F1™ World Championship season. The fuel 
will meet FIA requirements of achieving greenhouse gas emissions 
savings, relative to fossil-fuel-derived petrol, of at least 65%.

Singapore Grand Prix, Round 18. 
Shell Commercial Road Transport (CRT) is also working to help 
drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector by providing fuels, 
lubricants and digital services to customers with heavy-duty vehicles 
in their fleets. We have a public electric vehicle charging facility for 
trucks in Hamburg, Germany, which has four fast-charging stations. 
We also offer drivers using heavy-duty LNG-fuelled trucks access 
to Shell-operated and partner networks in Europe. We have LNG 
refuelling sites in Austria and Hungary.

In April 2024, we opened our bioLNG liquefaction plant at the Shell 
Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland. This can produce 100,000 
tonnes of bioLNG per annum, which will help around 5,000 LNG 
trucks reduce their carbon emissions. Since 2022, our customers 
in the Netherlands have been able to opt for a bioLNG blend.
Trading and Supply
Through our main trading and supply offices in London, Houston, 
Singapore and Rotterdam, we trade low-carbon fuels, refined products, 
chemical feedstocks and environmental products. We trade in physical 
and financial contracts, and have wholesale commercial fuel activities. 
Shell Wholesale Commercial Fuels provides fuels for transport, industry 
and heating — from reliable main-grade fuels to premium products. 
With about 180 Shell and joint-venture (including pipeline) terminals 
and operating in around 25 countries, our infrastructure is well 
positioned to make deliveries around the world.
Lubricants
Shell Lubricants has been the number one global finished lubricants 
supplier in terms of market share for 18 consecutive years, according 
to Kline & Company data for 2023. Shell lubricants are available 
across more than 175 markets for passenger cars, motorcycles, 
trucks, coaches, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, 
power generation, agriculture and construction. 
In addition to making premium lubricants for conventional vehicles, 
we also make Shell E-fluids for electric vehicles from base oils made 
from natural gas at Pearl gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Qatar.
Our global lubricants supply chain has a network of 32 lubricants 
blending plants, four base oil plants (one of which we operate), 
10 grease plants and five GTL base oil storage hubs.
Sectors and Decarbonisation
The Sectors and Decarbonisation business sells fuels, speciality 
products and services including low-carbon energy solutions to a 
broad range of commercial customers including the aviation, marine, 
and agricultural sectors.
Shell Bitumen supplies customers across several markets and provides 
enough bitumen to resurface 500 kilometres of road lanes every day.
Shell Sulphur Solutions manages the value chain of sulphur from 
refining to marketing. It provides sulphur for use in applications, 
such as fertiliser, mining and chemicals. It also licenses Shell Thiogro 
technologies to create sulphur-enhanced fertilisers. 
Aviation
Shell Aviation provides aviation fuel, lubricants and low-carbon 
solutions globally. Shell's Avelia platform is one of the world's first 
blockchain-powered sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) book-and-claim 
solutions for business travel. It is designed to help trigger demand for 
SAF — increased demand would help encourage investment in SAF 
production. Wider production and supply, driven by increased 
demand, could help lower the price point for these fuels. Since launch, 
Avelia has injected more than 18 million gallons of SAF into the fuel 
network at nine airports around the world and supported more than 
36 airlines and corporate customers in accessing the environmental 
attributes of SAF.
Marine
Shell Marine serves customers whose vessels range from ocean-going 
tankers to fishing boats. We supply seven types of fuel, more than 
300 grades of lubricants and low-carbon solutions. Our global supply 
network covers key bunkering locations. Shell Marine also supplies 
chemical products, and marine-related technical and digital services. 
Our lubricants are used in around 10,000 vessels and are available 
in more than 700 ports across more than 50 countries. 
Biofuels
Shell and the non-operated joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 44%) 
are, together, one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of 
biofuels. Biofuels, along with natural gas, will play a key role in 
reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport.
In 2024, around 10.37 billion litres of biofuels (2023: 9.7 billion litres) 
were blended into Shell's sale of fuels worldwide, which includes the 
Shell share of sales made by Raízen. Raízen produced, on a 100% 
basis, around 3.16 billion litres of ethanol in 2024 (2023: 3.12 billion 
litres). The cellulosic ethanol plant at Raízen's Costa Pinto mill in Brazil 
produced 61 million litres of second-generation ethanol in 2024 (2023: 
30 million litres). Expansion began in 2024, with the start-up at a new 
plant and commissioning of two further plants at the end of 2024. The 
majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Raízen is 
sold unblended to international customers in markets such as the USA, 
Europe and Japan. Raízen also produced around 5.1 million tonnes of 
sugar from sugar cane (2023: 5.8 million tonnes).
Renewable natural gas (RNG), also known as biogas or biomethane, is 
gas derived from processing organic waste in a controlled environment 
until it is fully interchangeable with conventional natural gas. 
Nature Energy, which Shell acquired in 2023, is one of Europe's largest 
producers of RNG. In 2024, Nature Energy opened its first biogas 
plant in France. The Sécalia plant is operated in partnership with 
the Dijon Céréales consortium of 150 farmers. It is France's largest 
renewable gas plant with annual production of 230 GWh of biogas. 
Together with its partners, Nature Energy also owns and operates 
13 biogas plants in Denmark and one in the Netherlands.
In March 2024, we started operations at Shell Downstream Bovarius, 
which is one of two facilities at the Bettencourt Dairies in Wendell, 
Idaho, USA, where we are converting dairy manure to RNG. Bovarius 
is expected to produce around 400,000 MMBtu a year of RNG. The 
second facility, Shell Downstream Friesian, is expected to produce 
around 350,000 MMBtu a year of RNG and operations are expected 
to start in 2025.

We announced the decision to stop processing crude oil into 
petrol, jet fuel and diesel at our Wesseling site in Germany, and 
to produce premium oils instead. We also opened our first bioLNG 
liquefaction plant in Germany. In Chemicals, we saw improved 
utilisation thanks to the ramp-up of operations at Shell Polymers 
Monaca, USA, and we took a final investment decision to expand 
our CSPC petrochemicals joint venture with CNOOC in Daya 
Bay, China. See "Outlook" on pages 16-17 for our Capital Markets

Financial delivery
Earnings 2024-2023
Segment earnings in 2024 increased by $275 million compared with 
2023. This reflected lower operating expenses (a decrease of $812 
million) and higher Chemicals margins (increase of $602 million). These 
were partially offset by lower Products margins (a decrease of $1,832 
million), mainly driven by lower refining margins and unfavourable tax 
movements ($248 million). Segment earnings in 2024 also included: 
￮net impairment charges and reversals of $1,176 million mainly 
relating to assets in Singapore; 
￮ charges of $142 million related to redundancy and restructuring; and
￮ unfavourable movements of $86 million relating to an accounting 
mismatch due to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, 
partly offset by favourable deferred tax movements of $114 million. 
These charges and movements are part of identified items, and 
compare with the full year 2023 which included net impairment 
charges and reversals of $2,195 million mainly relating to the 
Chemicals assets in Singapore, and charges of $82 million related to 
redundancy and restructuring partly offset by favourable movements 
of $214 million relating to an accounting mismatch due to fair value 
accounting of commodity derivatives.
In 2024, Adjusted Earnings from Chemicals accounted for (15)%, 
Refining for 34% and Trading and Optimisation including pipelines for 
81%. The decrease in Adjusted Earnings of $683 million was driven by 
the following:
￮Products Adjusted Earnings were $1,818 million lower than in 2023, 
mainly driven by lower refining and oil sands margins and 
unfavourable tax movements, higher depreciation partly offset by 
lower operating expenses.
￮ Chemicals negative Adjusted Earnings were $1,135 million lower 
than in 2023, mainly because of higher margins and lower operating 
expenses, and lower depreciation.
Prior year earnings summary
Segment earnings in 2023 were 66% lower than in 2022, reflecting 
lower Products margins (a decrease of $1,545 million), mainly driven 
by lower refining margins and partly offset by higher margins from 
trading and optimisation. The segment earnings also reflected higher 
depreciation charges (an increase of $543 million) due to the start-up 
of operations at Shell Polymers Monaca in the USA. These losses were 
partly offset by higher Chemicals margins (an increase of $612 million). 
Segment earnings in 2023 included the following:
￮net impairment charges and reversals of $2,195 million, mainly 
related to the Chemicals assets in Singapore; and
￮ charges of $82 million related to redundancy and restructuring, 
partly offset by favourable movements of $214 million related 
to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives.

These charges and gains are part of identified items and compare 
with 2022, which included:
￮net impairment charges and reversals of $226 million;
￮ legal provisions of $149 million;
￮ unfavourable movements of $142 million related to the fair value 
accounting of commodity derivatives;
￮ tax charges relating to the EU solidarity contribution of $74 million; 
partly offset by gains of $210 million, related to the sale of assets; and
￮ gains of $104 million, related to the remeasurement of redundancy 
and restructuring costs.
In 2023, Adjusted Earnings from Chemicals accounted for (43)%, 
Refining for 67% and Trading and Optimisation including pipelines for 
76%. The decrease in Adjusted Earnings of $975 million was driven by 
the following:
￮Products Adjusted Earnings were $758 million lower than in 2022, 
mainly driven by lower refining and oil sands margins and partly 
offset by higher margins from Trading & Optimisation.
￮ Chemicals negative Adjusted Earnings were $217 million more than 
in 2022, mainly because of higher depreciation and operating 
expenses, partly offset by higher margins and Income from 
associates.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities in 2024 was primarily driven by 
Adjusted EBITDA, working capital inflows of $524 million, dividends 
(net of profits) from joint ventures and associates of $304 million and 
net cash inflows relating to commodity derivatives of $219 million. 
These inflows were partly offset by cash outflows relating to legal 
provisions of $215 million, tax payments of $146 million, cash 
outflows relating to the timing impact of payments relating to 
emission certificates and biofuel programmes of $114 million,
and a non-cash cost of supplies adjustment of $109 million.
Shell's policy is to settle the inter-segment use of tax attributes between 
business segments. This settlement is usually made in cash but in certain 
instances there is no cash settlement. In 2024, the Integrated Gas 
segment's deferred tax assets ($974 million) were mainly used by the 
Upstream ($759 million) and Chemicals and Products ($183 million) 
segments, for which no cash settlement was made.
Cash capital expenditure
Cash capital expenditure* increased by $0.3 billion in 2024 to $3.3 
billion mainly because of growth projects in China. Our cash capital 
expenditure* is expected to be around $3 billion in 2025.

Operational performance
Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation 
Utilisation is defined as the actual use of the plants as a percentage of 
the rated capacity. Chemicals manufacturing plant utilisation was 
8 percentage points higher than in 2023, mainly due to economic 
optimisation in 2023. The increase was also driven by the ramp-up of 
Shell Polymers Monaca and lower unplanned maintenance in 2024.
Refinery utilisation
Utilisation is defined as the actual use of the plants as a percentage 
of the rated capacity. Refinery utilisation of 85% was in line with 2023.
Chemicals and Products sales
Chemicals sales volumes were 6% higher than in 2023, mainly due to 
higher polyethylene volumes partly offset by lower intermediate volumes.
Products sales volumes were 2% lower than in 2023 due to lower Trading 
sales volumes in Europe partly offset by increases in the USA and Asia.

Portfolio and business developments
Significant portfolio and business developments:
￮In January 2024, we took an FID to convert the hydrocracker of 
the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland 
in Germany into a production unit for Group III base oils.
￮ In May 2024, we agreed to sell our Energy and Chemicals Park in 
Singapore to CAPGC Pte. Ltd., a joint venture company between 
Chandra Asri Capital Pte. Ltd. and Glencore Asian Holdings Pte. Ltd. 
The transaction will transfer all of Shell's interests in Shell Energy and 
Chemicals Park Singapore to CAPGC [A].
￮ In June 2024, we took an FID for Polaris, a carbon capture project 
at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Scotford in Alberta, Canada. 
We also took an FID to proceed with the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub 
which will store CO2 captured by the Polaris project.
￮ In January 2025, CNOOC and Shell Petrochemicals Company 
Limited (CSPC), a 50-50 joint venture between Shell Nanhai B.V and 
CNOOC Petrochemicals Investment Ltd, took an FID to expand its 
petrochemical complex in Daya Bay, Huizhou, south China.
Business and property
Energy and chemicals plants
W
e are repurposing our refineries into energy and chemicals parks to 
focus on meeting customers' low-carbon and sustainability needs. This 
is underway at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. We continue to explore 
options for the former Convent Refinery in Louisiana, USA, which has 
been shut down, and we have agreed to sell our Energy and Chemicals 
Park in Singapore. As we transform our refineries, we are building new 
facilities or converting existing units to support low-carbon products, 
while dismantling units that do not deliver sustainable long-term value.
Chemicals
Products made from chemicals are used in everyday life, including 
in medical equipment, construction, transport, electronics, agriculture 
and sports. Our plants produce a range of base chemicals, including 
ethylene, propylene and aromatics, and intermediate chemicals, such 
as styrene monomer, propylene oxide, solvents, linear alpha olefins, 
detergent alcohols, ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol and polyethylene. 
We have the capacity to produce around 8.1 million tonnes of ethylene 
a year (including the Shell share of capacity entitlement (offtake rights) 
of joint ventures and associates, which may be different from nominal 
equity interest). 
[A] Transaction subject to completion.
Our Pennsylvania chemical project, Shell Polymers Monaca, which 
commenced operations in November 2022, was not fully functional 
during 2023 due to operational and start-up challenges. The facility 
has since ramped up operations since the first quarter of 2024.
We are expanding our product portfolio to include chemicals 
made from circular feedstocks, and more intermediates 
and performance chemicals, such as polyethylene and polycarbonate. 
We operate chemical plants worldwide and have a balance of 
locations, feedstocks and products. In 2024, we began production at 
our new pyrolysis oil upgrader at the Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk in 
the Netherlands. The unit improves the quality of pyrolysis oil, a liquid 
made from hard-to-recycle plastic waste, and turns it into chemical 
feedstock. The plant has the capacity to process up to 50,000 tonnes 
of pyrolysis oil per year.
Products – Refining and Trading
Refining
We have interests in eight refineries, with a total capacity to process 
1.6 million barrels of crude oil a day. The distribution of our refining 
capacity is 60% in Europe, 26% in the Americas and 14% in Asia.
In 2024, we took an FID to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling 
site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany into a 
production unit for Group III base oils. These mineral base oils have 
a very high viscosity index, which meets transport industry standards, 
and are produced with hydrocracking technology. The market for high-
quality engine and transmission oils, as well as electric vehicle fluids 
and cooling fluids, some of which are made from these oils, is expected 
to grow. Crude oil processing will end at the Wesseling site in 2025 
but continue at the Godorf site.

Trading and Supply
Through our main trading offices in London, Houston, Singapore 
and Rotterdam, we trade crude oil, low-carbon fuels, refined 
products, chemical feedstocks and environmental products.
We trade in physical and financial contracts, lease storage and 
transportation capacities, and manage global shipping activities. 
Shipping and Maritime enables the safe delivery of our contracts and 
this includes supplying feedstock for our refineries and chemical plants, 
and finished products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel to our 
Marketing segment and customers.

Pipelines
We own and operate three tank farms across the USA through Shell 
Pipeline Company LP (Shell interest 100%). It transports around 1.5 
billion barrels of crude oil, refined products and chemicals a year 
through around 5,500 kilometres of pipelines in the Gulf of America 
and nine US states. Our non-operated ownership interests provide 
another 13,000 kilometres of pipeline.
Our pipelines carry more than 40 types of crude oil and more than 
20 grades of fuel and chemicals, including petrol, diesel, aviation 
fuel and chemicals including ethylene.
We own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream 
and logistics assets. Our assets include interests in entities that own 
crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as 
key infrastructure to:
￮transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to US Gulf 
Coast and Midwest refining markets; and 
￮ deliver refined products from those markets to major demand 
centres.
Our assets also include interests in entities that own natural gas and 
refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market 
hubs and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical 
sites along the US Gulf Coast. 
Oil Sands
Synthetic crude oil is produced by mining bitumen-saturated sands, 
extracting the bitumen and transporting it to a processing facility where 
hydrogen is added to make a wide range of feedstocks for refineries. 
The Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) in Alberta, Canada, includes 
the Albian Sands mining and extraction operations, the Scotford 
Upgrader and the Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) facility. 
Quest CCS captures about 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 from the 
hydrogen manufacturing units within the upgrader. Since opening in 
2015, Quest CCS has safely stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO2.
We have a 50% interest in 1745844 Alberta Ltd. (formerly known 
as Marathon Oil Canada Corporation), which holds a 20% interest 
in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project.
Pursuant to our 2017 agreement with Canadian Natural Resources 
Limited, our remaining mining interest and associated synthetic 
crude oil reserves will be swapped for an additional 10% interest 
in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest CCS project. The transaction 
is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2025, subject 
to regulatory approvals.

Progressing CCS to 
help decarbonise 
our and customers' 
activities
As part of our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions, we 
are investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects to help 
decarbonise our own operations, as well as those of our customers.
In June 2024, we took a final investment decision to proceed with 
the Polaris carbon capture project (Shell interest 100%) at the Shell 
Energy and Chemicals Park Scotford in Alberta, Canada. Polaris 
is designed to capture an estimated 650,000 tonnes of CO2 
annually. We also took a final investment decision to proceed with 
the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub which will store the CO2 captured 
by the Polaris project.
Both Polaris and Atlas are expected to begin operations towards 
the end of 2028. A future additional phase of Atlas that could 
potentially store carbon for the partners and other companies is 
subject to a future possible investment decision.
Polaris and Atlas will build on the success of the Quest Carbon 
Capture and Storage (CCS) facility (Shell interest 10%) at Scotford, 
which has captured and stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO2 
since 2015 (as at the end of 2024). The CO2 captured by Quest 
CCS from the hydrogen manufacturing units within the upgrader is 
stored in a saline aquifer more than 2 kilometres underground.
Northern lights shipments due in 2025
In September 2024, our Northern Lights joint venture in Norway 
(Shell interest 33.3%) with Equinor and TotalEnergies, completed 
the onshore and offshore facilities for the world's first project to 
offer commercial carbon transport and storage as a service. 
The first marine CO2 shipments are expected in 2025.
Carbon dioxide captured by customers in industries that are 
difficult to decarbonise is liquefied, transported by ship to a 
receiving terminal on the Norwegian coast, then piped 100 km 
offshore for safe, permanent storage 2,600 metres under the 
North Sea. Agreements have already been signed with Yara, 
the crop nutrition company, and Ørsted, the renewable energy 
company, to transport and store CO2 from production facilities 
in the Netherlands and Denmark respectively. 
Northern Lights has the capacity to store around 1.5 million tonnes 
of CO2 per year. It is part of the Norwegian government's Longship 
project to develop a decarbonisation value chain, from carbon 
capture to transport and storage, for companies in Norway and 
across Europe.
CCS hubs developed to offer CCS-as-a-service to our customers are 
reported in the Renewable and Energy Solutions segment. Where 
existing or future CCS projects may help to decarbonise our own 
assets, they will be reported in the segment where the asset sits.

In 2024, we continued to develop our portfolio of renewable 
and low-carbon solutions, with an increased focus on energy 
storage, flexible generation and, increasingly, on power trading. 
We started commercial operations at an offshore wind park in the 
Netherlands and at two solar parks in Italy and the USA. We also 
agreed to acquire a combined-cycle gas turbine power plant to 
strengthen our power business in New England, USA. We made 
progress in carbon capture and storage by taking the final 
investment decisions to proceed with two projects in Canada, 
while our Northern Lights joint venture completed its onshore 
and offshore facilities in Norway for the world's first commercial 
carbon transport and storage project. See "Outlook" on pages

Earnings 2024-2023 [A]
Segment earnings in 2024 decreased by $4,318 million compared 
with 2023. This reflected lower margins (decrease of $1,719 million), 
mainly from trading and optimisation primarily in Europe due to lower 
volatility. This was partly offset by lower operating expenses (decrease 
of $632 million). Segment earnings in 2024 also included net 
impairment charges and reversals of $1,085 million, mainly related 
to renewable generation assets in North America, and partly offset 
by favourable movements of $300 million relating to an accounting 
mismatch due to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, and 
a net gain on sale of assets of $94 million. These net charges and 
favourable movements are part of identified items and compare with the 
full year 2023 which included favourable movements of $2,756 million 
due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, partly offset 
by net impairment charges and reversals of $669 million. As part of 
Shell's normal business, commodity derivative hedge contracts are 
entered into for the mitigation of economic exposures on future 
purchases, sales and inventory.
Adjusted Earnings were a loss of ($497) million in 2024. Adjusted 
Earnings from Renewable Power Generation, Hydrogen, CCS, Nature- 
Based Solutions (NBS) and Shell Ventures accounted for 146% of 
2024 negative Adjusted Earnings. These were partially offset by 
positive Adjusted Earnings contributions from Energy Marketing 
and Trading and Optimisation (46%).
Prior year earnings summary
Segment earnings reflected lower margins (a decrease of $684 
million), mainly from trading and optimisation. This was due to lower 
gas and power price volatility in 2023, unfavourable tax movements 
(a decrease of $218 million), and higher operating expenses resulting 
from business growth (an increase of $168 million). Segment earnings 
also included favourable movements of $2,756 million due to the fair 
value accounting of commodity derivatives, partly offset by net 
impairment charges and reversals of $669 million. These favourable 
movements and charges are part of identified items and compare with 
2022, which included unfavourable movements of $2,443 million due 
to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and impairment 
charges of $361 million.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities was primarily driven by net cash 
inflows related to derivatives of $3,012 million and working capital 
inflows of $923 million, partly offset by tax payments of $457 million 
and Adjusted EBITDA.

Cash capital expenditure
Within cash capital expenditure, $1.6 billion was in low-carbon 
energy solutions. This includes Renewable Power Generation, 
Environmental Solutions, Hydrogen and CCS. In 2023, cash capital 
expenditure included $2.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions. 
Higher cash capital expenditure in 2023 was mainly a result of 
Hollandse Kust Noord spending.
Our cash capital expenditure* is expected to be in the range
of $2-3 billion in 2025.
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 87.
Operational performance
External power sales
In 2024, our external power sales increased compared with 2023 
as a result of organic customer growth across the portfolio and 
acquisitions.
Sales of pipeline gas to end-use customers
In 2024, the decrease in our sales of pipeline gas to end-use customers 
was mainly driven by the decision to prioritise value over volume, 
focusing on higher-margin sales.

Business and property
We are building a business to deliver clean energy for our customers.
Despite the rapid growth seen in recent years, the renewable energy 
sector as a whole is experiencing significant challenges, including 
supply chain disruptions and regulatory hurdles, which have led to 
delays, increased costs and downward pressure on margins. 2024 was 
a year of significantly lower volatility in gas and power markets, which 
prevented us from maintaining trading and optimisation results at the 
levels we have seen in previous years. Our market outlook and supply 
chain environment has also deteriorated, resulting in significant 
impairment charges across various assets within our North American 
and European portfolios. To address this and given our focus on value, 
we refreshed our renewable generation, energy marketing, and gas 
and power trading strategy in December 2024. As part of this refresh, 
we are shifting our asset portfolio towards energy storage and flexible 
generation, and we are reducing investments in offshore wind assets. 
Our refresh also sees an increased focus on gas and power trading, 
leveraging our existing capabilities and technology to improve returns 
of this business. We also aim to maximise returns from our existing 
onshore positions by using capital-light business models, debt finance 
and working with partners.
Energy marketing
We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, 
commercial and industrial customers. We do this through direct 
electricity sales, storage solutions and energy optimisation services. 
Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are 
Australia and the USA. In Australia, we are one of the largest 
commercial and industrial retailers of electricity in the market.
Trading and optimisation
We trade and optimise power and pipeline gas, and carbon credits 
from our own assets and from third parties. We work with Shell 
businesses across regions to offer energy solutions that can help our 
customers decarbonise. We have a gas and power trading presence 
in key markets, including the Americas and Europe, but also in Australia 
and Asia.
In October 2024, we signed an agreement to acquire RISEC Holdings, 
which owns a 609 MW two-unit combined-cycle gas turbine power 
plant in Rhode Island, USA. We completed the transaction in January 
2025. This acquisition secures long-term supply and capacity offtake 
for Shell in the deregulated Independent System Operator New 
England (ISO New England) power market.
Renewable power generation
We enable renewable power generation by owning and operating 
solar plants and wind farms, and by participating in joint ventures. 
We target selective growth in markets where there is potential 
for integration with our value chain. 
A significant milestone was achieved by the CrossWind joint venture 
(Shell interest 79.9%) when the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind 
development in the Netherlands achieved commercial operations in 
March 2024 after producing its first electricity in June 2023. The wind 
farm plans to supply electricity to the 200 MW electrolyser Holland 
Hydrogen 1 (Shell interest 100%) that we are building in the 
Netherlands 
Savion completes build and sale of Madison Fields
In the USA, our wholly owned subsidiary Savion is a utility-scale 
solar and energy storage developer. Savion specialises in 
developing solar power and energy storage projects, serving a 
variety of customers, including utilities and major commercial 
and industrial organisations. 
In January 2024, Savion completed the construction and sale 
of its 50% interest in the Madison Fields 180 MW solar park to 
InfraRed Capital Partners. Madison Fields, in Madison County, 
Ohio, is the first project to be designed, developed and owned 
by Savion. In July 2024, the project achieved commercial 
operations and Savion entered into a long-term power purchase 
agreement (PPA) with Amazon for the offtake of the facility's full 
capacity generation of solar energy.
Savion also signed an agreement in June 2024 to sell the 150 
MW Cass County Solar Project in Illinois, to Ameren Missouri. 
In December 2024, Savion's solar farm in Martin County in 
Kentucky, USA reached commercial operations.

In May 2024, Shell opened its first solar park in Zamboni, Italy, with a 
capacity of 20 MW. Shell also signed a power purchase agreement for 
Baker Hughes to offtake part of the power generated at the plant.
At the end of 2024, our share of renewable power generation 
capacity was 3.4 GW in operation and 4.0 GW in development. 
Our renewable power generation capacities are listed below:

Hydrogen 
Hydrogen can help reduce emissions for our customers in sectors which 
are hard to decarbonise, such as heavy industry and heavy-duty road 
transport. We can also use it to help decarbonise our own assets. Shell 
is part of joint ventures and alliances that have built electrolysers and 
hydrogen filling stations. We have also participated in feasibility 
studies that aim to show the viability of a global import and export 
market for hydrogen. 
When it comes to developing hydrogen investment opportunities, we aim 
to do so where we see adjacencies with our integrated business value 
chain and where we believe there are pathways to attractive returns. 
Since 2021, we have operated an electrolyser (Shell interest 100%) in 
Germany, which produces hydrogen using electricity from renewable 
sources. In July 2022 we announced the final investment decision to 
build Holland Hydrogen I. Construction is progressing well, and we 
expect to start commissioning in late 2026, with production ramp-up 
in 2027. In July 2024, we took the final investment decision to build 
REFHYNE II, a 100 MW electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen 
in Germany. We plan to use this hydrogen to partially decarbonise the 
Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland. We expect the electrolyser 
to be operational by the end of the decade.

construction in the Netherlands. 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
We report existing CCS operations that help decarbonise our 
own assets in the segment where the relevant asset sits. We also offer 
carbon capture, transport and storage to our customers as we seek 
to help them decarbonise.
In September 2024, the Northern Lights joint venture (Shell interest 
33.3%) in Norway completed the construction of its carbon storage 
facilities. Northern Lights is designed to transport and store up to 1.5 
million tonnes of CO2 per year in its first phase. We expect the first 
shipment of CO2 in early 2025 from industrial customers in Norway 
and Continental Europe. Equinor and TotalEnergies are equal partners 
in the joint venture.
In June 2024, Shell took an FID with its partner, ATCO EnPower, on 
the Atlas Carbon Storage Hub (Shell interest 50%). Atlas is designed 
to store an estimated 650,000 tonnes of CO2 captured annually from 
the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Scotford in Alberta, Canada. The 
CO2 is to be captured by Shell's Polaris project for which an FID was 
also taken in 2024. Both Polaris and Atlas are expected to begin 
operations towards the end of 2028.
See "Progressing CCS to decarbonise our and customers' activities" on page 67.
Shell also has CCS project opportunities at earlier stages of 
development in Canada, the USA, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Nature and environmental solutions
Through the Nature Based Solutions (NBS) business and the 
Environmental Products Trading Business (EPTB), we provide carbon 
credits to our customers. NBS invests in projects that conserve, enhance 
and restore ecosystems – such as forests, grasslands and wetlands – 
to prevent GHG emissions or reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. 
Through EPTB, we develop, source, offtake, trade and supply 
environmental products across compliance and voluntary markets. 
This includes working with our other businesses such as Integrated 
Gas or Marketing to provide integrated energy solutions to customers.
Shell Ventures
Through Shell Ventures entities we act as an investor and a partner 
to start-ups, businesses and venture funds to help accelerate the 
energy and mobility transformation. We invest in companies that 
work on solutions to lower emissions, electrify energy systems, gain 
data-based insights and provide innovative consumer solutions.
Investments
Within R&ES, we maintain an integrated business model with 
trading and optimisation to help us manage our value delivery. Our 
investments in low-carbon solutions are subject to financial modelling 
and stress-testing, due diligence and risk assessments to ensure that 
our capital is allocated to the most attractive low-carbon projects 
and opportunities.

Headquarter and central functions provide communications, 
finance, treasury, human resources, information technology (IT), 
legal, real estate and security services to the businesses. These 
functions also provide support for shareholder-related activities, 
such as investor relations. The central functions are supported 
by business service centres, which process transactions, manage 
data and produce regulatory returns, among other services. 
All finance expense, income and related taxes for Shell, which is 
headquartered in London, are included in the Corporate segment 
earnings rather than the business segment earnings. Most headquarter 
and central function costs are recovered from the business segments. 
Costs that are not recovered or relate to centrally managed activities 
are retained in Corporate. 
The Holdings and Treasury organisation manages many of our 
corporate entities. It is the point of contact between Shell and 
external capital markets and, for example, raises debt instruments 
and conducts foreign exchange transactions. Treasury centres in 
London and Singapore support these activities. 
Shell's innovation portfolio is managed as a central function. We have 
major research and development (R&D) centres in the Netherlands, the 
USA and India, and smaller specialised centres in Germany, Brazil and 
China. We use technology to enhance our existing value chains and 
help build the energy system of the future. Shell's longer-term innovation 
portfolio is reported as part of the Corporate segment. Other innovation 
portfolio activities are reported in the business segments. 
Earnings 2024-2023
An increase in the negative segment earnings was mainly driven by 
reclassifications, from equity to profit and loss, of cumulative currency 
translation differences principally triggered by changes in the funding 
structure. This resulted in unfavourable movements of $1,122 million, 
included in identified items, and was partially offset by favourable 
tax movements, net interest movements and currency exchange 
rate effects.

Prior year earnings summary
An increase in the negative segment earnings was mainly driven 
by unfavourable movements in currency exchange rate effects
and tax credits.
Cash flow from operating activities
Cash flow from operating activities decreased primarily due to 
unfavourable working capital movements.
Self-insurance
Shell, like other major oil and gas companies, self-insures most of 
its exposures to hazard risks. Our Group insurance companies are 
wholly owned subsidiaries. They provide insurance coverage to our 
subsidiaries and entities in which we have an interest, including those 
that are not controlled by Shell. 
We continually assess the safety performance of our operations and 
make risk mitigation recommendations, where relevant, to keep the 
risk of an accident as low as possible. Our insurance companies are 
adequately capitalised and they may transfer risks to third-party 
insurers where economical, effective and relevant.
See "Risk factors" on page 140.

Other central activities
Shell operates certain key activities centrally. These include Projects 
& Technology, intellectual property and information technology. 
This allows us to provide leadership, innovation and risk 
management across our business. 
Information technology and cyber security 
Digitalisation is a key success factor in delivering Shell's strategy. 
We are transforming our IT systems to support our evolving portfolio 
of businesses. We invest in new technologies, such as artificial 
intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, to enhance our IT 
capabilities and bring value to the business. 
The growing dependence on IT and rising data volumes introduce risks. 
A breach in IT systems or data loss could significantly impact Shell and 
its supply chain, leading to productivity disruptions, loss of confidential 
information, regulatory penalties, and potential reputational harm. 
Additionally, sanctions, including orders to delete data and regulatory 
fines, might be imposed on Shell if authorities find Shell failed to meet 
its obligations in relation to cyber security or personal data protection.
In 2024, we continued to implement a comprehensive cyber security 
programme as part of our cyber defence strategy. This was done 
through the formalisation of the Information and Digital Technology 
(IDT) requirements based on the Shell Performance Framework (SPF). 
Our Information and Digital Technology Standard sets out a structured 
approach to identify, assess and mitigate IT and cyber security risks. 
Following the approval of the IDT requirements, we refreshed our 
Information Risk Management (IRM) capabilities and streamlined 
the organisational structure to enhance the formal Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO) role, with support from the Executive 
Committee. This included integrating the cyber defence teams and other 
decentralised cyber security functions into the central IRM organisation. 
These changes are in effect from March 2025.
Our global integrated IRM and cyber defence teams are staffed with 
cyber security professionals that monitor, assure and help defend our 
global IT and data landscape. As all our employees play a role in 
protecting our IT systems, we give them training on data protection, 
regulatory compliance and regularly run cyber security awareness 
campaigns and simulations on how to respond to cyber-attacks.We 
evaluate emerging digital technologies with our businesses annually to 
align on their impact and necessary remediation, considering the value 
and opportunities they present, as well as their incremental risks. 
Additionally, Shell works to monitor and respond in real time to cyber 
security incidents as they happen.
Cyber security risk management
Our cyber security capabilities are embedded into our IT systems, 
and our IT and data are protected by various detective and protective 
technologies and controls. A structured approach to identify, assess 
and mitigate the IT and cyber security risks is built into our support 
processes and is benchmarked to external best practices. We 
continuously track cyber-attacks, threat intelligence, cyber legislation 
(including the EU AI Act) and vulnerabilities relevant to our IT 
landscape and have a well-structured incident management and 
escalation process in place.
The security of IT services, where operated by external IT companies, is 
managed through contractual clauses and additionally through formal 
supplier assurance reports for critical IT services. Shell collaborates bi-
annually with third parties and supplements these reports with bi-
annual internal benchmarking to assess our cyber security risk 
management practices against cyber security best practices and peer 
organisations. Using the insights gained from these assessments, along 
with changes in external risks and the outcome of internal audits and 
control testing results, we enhance our cyber security capabilities and 
adopt a risk-based strategy for our investment decisions concerning 
cyber risk exposure. 
Shell employees and contract staff are required to complete mandatory 
training courses and participate in regular cyber threat awareness 
campaigns. In 2024, we introduced the Think Secure Scorecard across 
the organisation. This provides data insights into the cyber behaviour 
of Shell staff on an individual level, encouraging continuous learning 
about cyber threats and advocating personal accountability. Shell has 
robust governance processes to monitor key cyber risks, provide risk 
assurance and encourage a corporate culture that prioritises security. 
Our cyber security strategy is regularly reviewed and updated, as 
required, by our CISO and Shell's Information and Digital Technology 
leadership team, with oversight from the EC, the Audit and Risk 
Committee, and the Board. These reviews involve consideration of 
external environment changes; strategic, operational, and cultural 
risks; response to cyber security risks and implementation of further 
remedial actions as appropriate; and updates on the performance 
and benchmarking of the Group's cyber defences. In 2024, dedicated 
deep dives into areas, such as geopolitical developments and artificial 
intelligence (AI), were performed. In 2024, Shell reported data privacy 
incidents to regulatory authorities across multiple jurisdictions. There 
were no cyber or data privacy incidents that had a material impact 
on Shell's business strategy, operations, or financial condition.

74 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 77 ----
The IRM organisation leadership teams involved in monitoring and 
managing our cyber security threat risk and assurance process have 
an average of around 25 years of experience. The IRM organisation is 
led by our CISO, who has more than 20 years of experience in the IT 
and information security field, including serving as the chief information 
officer for various large public companies. In addition to holding 
the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) 
certification, our CISO holds other qualified technical expert 
certifications, has completed the London School of Economics Executive 
Development programme, and holds an undergraduate degree in 
management information systems, risk management, and corporate 
finance. Our CISO is active in various cyber-security industry trade 
groups and is on the board of Oil and Natural Energy Information 
Sharing and Analysis Center (ONE-ISAC), having previously 
held leadership positions in the oil and gas cyber security sector.
Intellectual property
At Shell, we have a wide-ranging intellectual property (IP) portfolio 
which includes patents, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and 
copyrights. The distinctive Shell Pecten, a trademark in use since the 
early 20
th
 century, and trademarks where the word Shell appears, help 
raise the profile of our Shell brand globally. We protect and defend 
our IP and we respect the valid IP rights of others. At December 31, 
2024, we held 8,677 patents. This includes granted patents and 
pending patent applications.
Shell holds trademarks globally, even in countries where we no longer 
operate. For instance, in 2024, we renewed national trademark 
registrations for the word marks "Shell", "Shell Spirax" and the Shell 
logo, through our local agent SABA Intellectual Property, who paid 
$10,543 in official fees to the Syrian Patent Office. Although we 
ceased operations in Syria in 2011, these renewals do not indicate 
any product sales in the country.
Innovation
We use technology to improve our efficiency, safety and 
competitiveness. By applying our technical and digital capabilities, 
we can also help build the low-carbon energy system of the future. In 
2024, we invested $1,099 million in research and development (R&D). 
We combine our expertise in R&D with digital solutions, often powered 
by AI, to help accelerate innovation and scale up more effectively.
Shell's Projects & Technology organisation and our businesses work 
together to determine the content, scope and budget for developing 
new technology that supports our activities. This includes partnering 
with start-ups and small- to medium-sized enterprises that are in the 
early stages of developing new technologies through our Shell 
Ventures and Shell GameChanger programme. New technology is 
developed using a maturation process, to systematically mitigate 
technical and commercial risks, while staying aligned with Shell's 
strategic ambitions and deployment commitments. 
See "Risk factors" on page 141.
Innovation is pivotal to what we do
Our research and development (R&D) seeks to deliver 
innovative, cost-competitive solutions that meet global energy 
demands while reducing emissions. To achieve this, we have 
a network of R&D centres and collaborate closely with our 
customers, suppliers and partners, as well as with many of 
the world's leading universities and research institutes.
Global Lubricants
In 2024, for instance, our Global Lubricants business was 
named industry leader by market analysts Kline + Company for 
the 18th consecutive year for consumer automotive, commercial 
automotive and industrial lubricants. These lubricants are 
designed to continually push the boundaries of engine and 
equipment performance and longevity, as well as to reduce 
emissions. This leadership is built on more than 45 years of 
research and commercial development of our proprietary gas-to-
liquids (GTL) technology with which we make high-quality liquid 
fuels, base oils for lubricants, and other speciality products from 
natural gas. 
Keeping data centres cool
We recently extended our comprehensive GTL product range 
by developing an immersion cooling fluid for data centres that 
significantly improves their performance and energy efficiency. 
Data centres consume vast amounts of electricity to power the 
servers and cool the heat they generate. Our new GTL 
immersion cooling fluid allows servers to run faster and cooler, 
improving computing performance and enabling considerable 
reductions in energy use, CO2 emissions and operating costs 
compared to conventional air cooling.
Second-generation biofuels
Shell is one of the world's largest producers, distributors and 
traders of biofuels made from sugar cane, corn and other types 
of biomass. In 2024, we commissioned a demonstration plant in 
partnership with Green Plains in Nebraska, USA, that uses our 
proprietary Shell Fibre Conversion Technology to convert the oil in 
corn kernels into second-generation low-carbon biofuel and high-
protein animal feed. This bolt-on technology is designed to help 
first-generation ethanol producers increase yield and margin –

Shell's energy transition plans
Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 
2050 and we are transforming our operations and energy products. 
We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris 
Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature this 
century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to 
the threat of climate change by "holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels 
and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels". 
As we implement our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions, 
we are responding to evolving global demand by offering our 
customers more and cleaner energy solutions. 
The world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains 
secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable 
low-carbon solutions. We believe our strategy supports a balanced 
transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while 
helping to build the energy system of the future. 
We recognise that the scale of the energy transition requires 
fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive 
government policies, advances in technology and investments by 
companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We 
advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can 
best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own 
emissions and help accelerate the energy transition.
There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future 
energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio 
that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that we believe 
will allow us to remain a successful business while working towards net-
zero emissions. We are changing the mix of energy products we sell 
and developing new carbon removal and abatement businesses. 
We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive 
strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory 
support from governments.
We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our 
customers transition to more cost-competitive and cleaner energy 
solutions. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses.
Integrated Gas - growing our world-leading LNG 
business with lower carbon intensity
We plan to grow our LNG volumes by adding new liquefaction 
capacity. We are developing new projects with lower carbon 
intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology 
in the form of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Beyond our own 
production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio 
by growing the LNG volumes that we purchase from third parties.
LNG provides both energy security and flexibility because it can be 
easily transported to places where it is needed most. It is also a critical 
fuel in the energy transition. Natural gas is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, 
producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to 
generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Upstream - cutting emissions from oil and gas production.
As we sustain oil and gas liquids production, we will continue to focus 
on delivering more value with less emissions. The oil we are producing 
will increasingly come from our deep-water business. Through 
innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-
margin and lower-carbon barrels. 
As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon 
management plans and working to reduce carbon emissions from our 
assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, 
and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. 
We see CCS as a core technology to further capture emissions from 
our facilities, reusing our own oil and gas fields where possible. 
We set a target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-operated 
assets by 2025 [A] five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative. 
Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, 
which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. With effect from 
January 1, 2025, SPDC has ceased routine flaring of associated gas, 
with the completion of essential gas capture projects and the shut-in 
of remaining facilities from which gas cannot be transported to market. 
We have therefore met our target to eliminate routine flaring from our 
upstream-operated assets by 2025 as of this date. 
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 
2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions – 
focusing our businesses to offer more low-carbon 
solutions while reducing sales of oil products.
We are starting from a place of strength. We believe that our global 
customer reach, our innovation and technology, and the strength of our 
supply and trading capabilities, mean we are well placed to deliver the 
low-carbon solutions people and businesses need, such as electric 
vehicle charging and biofuels, to support our customers as they 
decarbonise. Leveraging our integrated portfolio of energy and 
chemicals parks, terminals and blending plants, we will make, buy, and 
blend products to meet customer demand. We are also able to identify 
changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.
To help us get to net zero, we have set short-, medium- and long-term 
targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, 
measured by using our net carbon intensity (NCI) metric. We believe 
these targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway derived from scenarios 
developed for the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). For more 
information see "Setting targets for NCI" on page 102.
We set out our climate-related targets and ambition on page 93. 
See "Our strategy" on pages 10-13.

Climate-related risks and opportunities identified 
by Shell over the short, medium and long term 
We are continually enhancing our approach to assessing and 
managing risks and opportunities resulting from climate change. 
This includes considering different time horizons and their relevance to 
risk identification and business planning. We actively monitor societal 
developments, such as regulation-driven carbon pricing mechanisms 
and customer-driven preferences for products. We incorporate these 
developments, where relevant, into potential scenarios which provide 
insights into how the energy transition may unfold in the medium and 
long term. These insights and those from various external scenarios 
(such as those prepared for the IPCC AR6) help guide how we set our 
strategy, capital allocation and climate-related targets and ambition.
The process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks is set 
out in "Risk management" on page 134. The impact and likelihood 
assessment described on page 134 helps us to prioritise climate-related 
risks and determine their relative materiality, based on a 
comprehensive picture of significant risks to any relevant business 
objectives. We consider climate-related risks from a strategic, 
operational, conduct and culture perspective to help us maintain a 
comprehensive view of the different types of climate risks we face and 
the different time horizons in which they may affect us. Monitoring and 
reviewing risks is a key risk management process. The EC, the Board 
and Board committees review climate-related risks and their impact 
on the Group, as appropriate. This allows management to take a 
holistic view and optimise risk mitigation responses, to ensure that 
climate-related risk responses are properly integrated into the 
relevant activities.
Shell has identified climate change and the energy transition as 
a material risk. The risk could potentially continue to result in changes 
to the demand for our products, supply chains and markets; further 
changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate; and 
increased litigation (see Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements "Legal proceedings and other contingencies" on 
page 309). 
The risk is composed of a combination of complex and interrelated 
elements that affect Shell's value chain and our asset, product and 
business portfolio. The risk landscape is evolving rapidly. To achieve 
our climate-related targets and ambition, active holistic management 
of all climate-related risk components is important. The composite 
risk is broken down into the following sub-components:
￮commercial risk;
￮ regulatory risk;
￮ societal risk (including litigation risk); and
￮ physical risk.
We are working to mitigate our identified climate-related risks and 
deliver more value with less emissions by focusing on performance, 
discipline and simplification. We believe we are positioning ourselves 
to achieve our financial targets, and climate-related targets and 
ambition by: 
￮reducing the GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 
improving our energy efficiency, deploying renewable electricity, 
and reducing methane emissions in our assets and projects;
￮ growing our LNG business while decarbonising our LNG portfolio in 
two main ways: by growing our portfolio with a lower carbon 
intensity, and continuing to invest in emissions abatement projects to 
reduce both CO₂ and methane emissions;
￮ managing our Integrated Gas and Upstream portfolio to support a 
balanced energy transition by cutting emissions from oil and gas 
production. Oil production is increasingly from our deep-water 
business which, through innovation, produces higher-margin and 
lower-carbon barrels; and 
￮ focusing our businesses in Downstream and Renewables and Energy 
Solutions to offer more low-carbon energy solutions, while reducing 
sales of oil products.In addition, we adapt our assets and activities 
as necessary to enhance our resilience to the physical risks related 
to climate change. Many of these adaptations are based on our 
Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards and 
practices.
See page 83 for more details of physical risks.
Our approach to climate change emphasises the need to work 
collaboratively. We aim to continue to build strategic alliances with 
customers, other companies and entire sectors so we and they can 
make profitable progress towards net zero. 
We engage with governments on their climate policies to advocate 
policies that help establish regulatory frameworks that will help to 
enable society to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are 
a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), a 
group of 12 national and international energy companies. The OGCI 
supports the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and recognises that 
collective actions can help drive the energy transition. 
We are signed up to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter 
(OGDC), in which companies have pledged to achieve near-zero 
methane emissions by 2030, zero routine flaring by no later than 
2030 and commit to halving scope 1 and 2 emissions by or before 
2050. In April 2024, we became the first official partner to the World 
Bank Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund partnership which 
we committed to at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in 
2023. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane 
Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework. Shell achieved the 
OGMP 2.0 Gold standard of reporting in 2023.
As a leading global energy business, Shell seeks to identify 
opportunities in the energy transition. These risks and opportunities 
are described below. Climate-related risks are also summarised in 
the "Risk management and risk factors" section on pages 137-138.
Time horizons: short, medium and long
Due to the inherent uncertainty and pervasive risks across our strategy 
and business model, we monitor climate-related risks and opportunities 
across multiple time horizons. 
￮Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial 
projections and use them to manage performance and expectations 
on a three-year cycle. These projections incorporate decarbonisation 
measures required to meet our short-term targets.
￮ Medium term (generally three to 10 years): these are embedded 
within our Operating Plan, with our continued focus on the customer, 
the investments and portfolio shifts required in the medium term that 
will reshape Shell's portfolio. 
￮ Long term (generally beyond 10 years): our portfolio and product 
mix are expected to evolve over time with changing customer 
demand.

Transition risks
Description CR1 Climate-related commercial risk
￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy may lead to lower sales volumes and/or margins due to a general reduction or elimination 
of demand for oil and gas products, possibly resulting in underutilised or stranded oil and gas assets, and a failure to secure 
new opportunities.
￮ Changing preferences of investors and financial institutions could reduce access to and increase the cost of capital.
Relevant time 
horizon
medium and long
Potential material 
impacts
Lower demand and margins for oil and gas products
￮Changing customer sentiment favouring the use of renewable and sustainable energy products may reduce demand for our oil and 
gas products. An excess of fossil fuel supply over demand could in the future result in reduced fossil fuel prices. This could result in 
lower earnings in the future, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.
Changing preferences of investors and financial institutions
￮Certain investors have decided to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to increase significantly, it could have a 
material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets. Some investors and financial institutions 
have been aligning their portfolios to a low-carbon and net-zero world, driven by both regulatory and broader stakeholder pressures. 
￮ A failure to decarbonise our business portfolios in line with investor and lender expectations could have a material adverse effect on 
our ability to access financing for certain types of projects. This could also adversely affect our partners' ability to finance their portion 
of costs, either through equity or debt.
￮ Sensitivity analysis of a 1% shift in Shell's weighted average cost of capital on asset carrying values is presented in the section "Carbon 
pricing and discount rate sensitivities" on page 89.
Remaining in step with the pace and extent of the energy transition
￮The energy transition provides us with significant opportunities, as described in "Climate-related opportunities" (CO1) below. If we fail 
to stay in step with the pace and extent of change, or customers and other stakeholders' demand for low-carbon products, this could 
adversely affect our reputation and future earnings. If we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or 
low-carbon products for which there may be insufficient demand. Therefore we cannot transition too quickly or we will be trying to sell 
products that customers do not want. If we are slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier, which would reduce 
demand for our products and adversely affect our reputation and materially affect our financial results.
￮ Low-carbon technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to help meet the world's energy demands competitively. If we are 
unable to develop the right technology and products in a timely and cost-effective manner there could be an adverse effect on our 
future earnings. The operating margins for our low-carbon products and services have been, and could continue to be, lower than 
the margins we have experienced historically in our oil and gas operations.
Description CR2 Climate-related regulatory risks
￮The transition to a low-carbon economy has increased, and is likely to continue to increase the cost of compliance for our assets and/or 
products, and may include restrictions on the use of hydrocarbons. The lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and 
frameworks increases the uncertainty around this risk.
Relevant time 
horizon
short, medium and long
Potential material 
impacts
Increased compliance costs 
￮Some governments have introduced carbon pricing mechanisms, which we believe can be an effective way to reduce GHG emissions 
across the economy at the lowest overall cost to society. 
￮ Shell's cost of compliance with the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and related schemes was around $381 million in 2024, as 
recognised in Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income for 2024. A further $3,565 million of costs in respect of emissions schemes 
and related environmental programmes were incurred in respect of biofuels ($2,942 million) and renewable power ($623 million) 
programmes (see Note 5 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 266-267).
￮ Shell's annual carbon cost exposure (including ETS and related schemes) is expected to increase over the next decade because of 
evolving carbon regulations, with the forecast annual cost exposure in 2025 estimated to be around $1 billion and around $5 billion 
in 2034. This estimate is based on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets, and real-term 
carbon cost estimates using the mid-price scenario (see Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 255-265 for more 
information) [A]. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of available CO2 free allowances as relevant to assets 
based on their location [B].
Restrictions on use of hydrocarbons
￮Governments may set regulatory frameworks in the future that could further restrict our exploration and production of hydrocarbons, 
and introduce controls to limit the use of such products. Failure to replace proved reserves could result in an accelerated decrease 
of future production, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
Lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks 
￮The lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around how carbon pricing and 
other regulatory mechanisms will be implemented in the future. This makes it harder to determine the appropriate assumptions to 
be taken into account in our financial planning and investment decision processes which could impair our ability to evaluate the 
robustness of our plans and opportunities. Changing net-zero policies and regulations could also lead to impairments of our existing 
oil and gas assets.
[A] Carbon cost estimates that include inflation, usually a yearly 2% inflation is applied.
[B] Free allowances are amounts of CO 2 an asset is allowed to emit without paying the emissions trading scheme (ETS) price/tax.

Transition risks continued
Description CR3 Climate-related societal risks (including litigation)
￮ As societal expectations develop around climate change, there is a potential impact on Shell's licence to operate, reputation, brand 
and competitive position. This is likely to include litigation.
Relevant time 
horizon
short, medium and long
Potential material 
impacts
Decline in reputation, brand and licence to operate
￮Societal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety 
and minimising damage to the environment. There is a focus on the role of the oil and gas sector in the context of climate change and 
the energy transition. This could negatively affect our brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could limit our ability to deliver 
our strategy, reduce consumer demand for our products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and restrict our ability 
to access capital markets or attract employees.
Deteriorating relationships with key stakeholders
￮Failure to decarbonise Shell's value chain in line with societal, governmental and investor expectations is a material risk to Shell's 
reputation as a responsible energy company. The impact of this risk includes shareholder divestment, greater regulatory scrutiny and 
potential asset closure resulting from public interest groups' protests.
Litigation
￮There is an increasing risk to oil and gas companies from private (including non-governmental organisations) and governmental 
lawsuits. If successful, these claims may have wide-ranging consequences, including forcing entities to hand over strategic autonomy in 
part to regulators, divesting from hydrocarbon technologies, denying entities regulatory approvals and/or requiring payment of fines 
or penalties or large compensation packages to plaintiffs.
￮ In some countries, governments, regulators, organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits of a wide variety, including seeking 
to hold oil and gas companies liable for costs associated with climate change, or seeking court-ordered reductions in emissions, 
challenging the regulatory approvals and operating licences, or challenging energy transition strategies and plans. While we believe 
these lawsuits to be without merit, losing could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
￮ In the Netherlands, in a case against Shell brought by a group of environmental NGOs and individual claimants (referred to herein as 
"Milieudefensie"), the Hague District Court in 2021 found that while Shell was not acting unlawfully, Shell had the obligation to reduce 
the aggregate annual volume of CO2 emissions of Shell operations and energy-carrying products sold across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 45% 
(net) by the end of 2030 relative to its 2019 emissions levels. For Scope 2 and 3, this was a significant best-efforts obligation. Shell 
appealed that ruling. On November 12, 2024, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld Shell's appeal and dismissed the claim against 
Shell. In doing so, the Court of Appeal annulled the earlier judgment of the District Court in its entirety with immediate effect. On 
February 11, Milieudefensie filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.
￮ We have also been subjected to climate activism which has caused disruptions to our operations and such disruptions could happen 
again in the future.

Physical risks
Description CR4 Climate-related physical risks
￮ The potential physical effects of changing climatic conditions could adversely affect our assets, operations, supply chains, employees 
and markets.
Relevant time 
horizon
short, medium and long
Potential material 
impacts
Types of physical risk
The impact of physical risks comes from both acute and chronic climate hazards. Acute hazards, such as flooding and droughts, wildfires 
and more severe tropical storms, and chronic hazards, such as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, could potentially impact some 
of our facilities, operations and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards and impacts is expected to increase in certain locations. 
Extreme weather events, whether or not related to climate change, could have a negative impact on our earnings, cash flows and 
financial condition. Mitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, is considered and embedded in the design 
and construction of our projects, and/or operation of our assets to help minimise the risk of adverse incidents to our employees and 
contractors, the communities where we operate, and our equipment. 
Shell's assessment
￮ In 2023, we carried out a detailed review to assess the impact of a range of changing climatic conditions, including projected changes 
in temperature, precipitation, wind and sea levels, across segments and geographies for our significant assets. We used IPCC climate 
modelling data covering three exploratory climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 [A]) across the time horizons 2025, 2030 
and 2050. These scenarios were selected to ensure a broad range of risks and uncertainties were assessed. There have been no 
changes to the climate modelling data that would require a full update of the 2023 assessment. We have confirmed there are no 
changes to the risk profile of our significant assets and accounted for portfolio changes. 
￮ In the short to medium term, the risks identified were found to be related to factors that Shell is already aware of (whether or not 
related to climate change) and that the assets are actively managing to mitigate, e.g. hurricane impacts on the US Gulf Coast, rising 
air temperatures in the Middle East and water scarcity in Europe and Asia. As an example, in recent years the Rhine river in Europe has 
seen historic lows during the summer months leading to challenges in the use of barges for transportation of our products. Dredging of 
harbours and investment in shallower-draft barges have helped to mitigate the risk.
￮ In the long term, the results of the exercise indicated that while we have evaluated against current climate modelling projections and 
our current asset portfolio, by 2050 the frequency and severity of the climate hazards may differ from current projections. The level of 
predictability is such that the need for investment in climate adaptation measures at the assets is not immediate and the results mean 
we are in a position to monitor the assets and determine whether there is any need for adaptation action, e.g. the impact of potential 
water scarcity on various assets.
￮ Our testing to assess the potential impact of climate-related changes on our significant assets covers over 70% of the carrying value of 
our physical assets as at December 31, 2023. Over 12% (based on the carrying value) of physical assets tested are considered to be 
exposed to climate-related physical risks in the short to medium term which the assets are already actively managing to mitigate. In 
addition, we reviewed significant acquisitions made in 2023 and 2024, none of which were found to have significant climate-related 
physical risks in the short to medium term. 
￮ Our business plan reflects the impact of mitigating actions in the short to medium term for the assets assessed. We will continue to 
monitor and assess the future exposure of our assets in the longer term to changing climatic conditions to establish the need for any 
further adaptation actions and related metrics.
￮ The impact of physical climate change on our operations is unlikely to be limited to the boundaries of our assets. For example, the 
downstream transportation and distribution of our products from our own operations could potentially be exposed to climate-related 
hazards that ultimately impact our operations. The overall impact, including how supply chains, resource availability and markets may 
be affected, also needs to be considered for a holistic assessment of this risk. Our assets manage this risk as part of broad risk and 
threat management processes as required by our SEAM Standards, part of the wider Shell Performance Framework.
[A] Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) refers to the GHG concentration (not emissions) trajectory adopted by the IPCC. The pathways describe different climate change scenarios, all 
of which are considered possible depending on the amount of GHG emitted in the years to come.

Opportunities
Description CO1 Climate-related opportunities
￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy also brings significant opportunities for us to benefit from changing customer demands, 
given our position as a leading global energy provider.
Relevant time 
horizon
short, medium and long
Potential material 
impacts
As the global energy mix changes, our current infrastructure, know-how and global footprint put us in an ideal position to service the 
changing energy demands of the market. Our global customer reach, our use of technology and innovation to develop the business 
models and fuels of the future and the strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own production, will help us deliver affordable 
and low-carbon solutions for our customers. Our research and development (R&D) activities are an important contributor to achieving our 
net-zero emissions target. We believe we are the investment case and partner of choice through the energy transition. As we work to 
deliver more value with less emissions we are focusing on:
LNG
￮ Demand for LNG is expected to grow. We are one of the world's largest suppliers of LNG, with around 40 million tonnes of equity 
capacity. Gas is critical to the energy transition and plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power 
generation with a less carbon-intensive alternative, as on average, coal-to-gas switching reduces emissions by 50% when producing 
electricity [A]. LNG also provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in electricity generation. LNG is the lowest-carbon 
marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant GHG emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. Furthermore, 
LNG offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bioLNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's 
largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. Beyond our 
own production, we expect to continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will 
remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. 
Our integrated model is at the heart of LNG value creation, with our business spanning every stage of the LNG journey. 
Biofuels 
￮We invest in biofuels where we see growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. 
Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and we expect that they will require low-carbon molecular 
solutions, such as biofuels, at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels, 
selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of 
biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and 
renewable natural gas (RNG). We expect that these fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our 
production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships, while using the strength of our trading 
business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Raízen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest 
producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels 
this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim 
to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels, while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies.
Integrated power
￮Renewable power is expected to be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise and we will continue to grow our 
integrated power business. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our portfolio, stepping back from activities that do 
not fit our strategy or generate enough return. We aim to use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the 
growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage 
through our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are focusing on selling power, including 
renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we 
expect to use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules, such as hydrogen. 
Electric vehicle charging
￮We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an 
electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric 
mobility markets of China and Europe. We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be 
needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations 
is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to 
offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars.
Carbon capture and storage
￮We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce 
emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we expect to direct most of our investments in CCS 
towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other 
companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address 
this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of 
commercially viable CCS projects.

Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on 
Shell's businesses, strategy and financial planning 
The transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will 
require simultaneous action in three areas:
￮an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy 
is used;
￮ a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix; and
￮ the mitigation of residual emissions through the use of technology 
and natural sinks. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that 
will deliver the net-zero goal, scenarios help us to consider the 
variables and the potential direction and pace of the transition needed. 
Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or 
outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for Shell's Operating Plans 
and financial statements. 
We have been developing scenarios within Shell for almost 60 years, 
helping Shell leaders to explore ways forward and make better 
decisions. Shell scenarios are designed to stretch management's 
thinking when it comes to considering events that may be possible, 
even if remotely. Scenarios help management to consider options and 
make choices in times of uncertainty and transition as we grapple with 
tough energy and environmental issues. They are aligned to different 
energy transition pathways and help in decision-making by guiding 
the identification of a wide range of risks and opportunities.
Different socio-economic and technological parameters are used to 
construct these scenarios, such as:
￮sectoral and regional energy demand;
￮ future trajectory of oil consumption and demand for natural gas; 
￮ renewable electricity demand and the pace of the electrification 
of the global energy system;
￮ supply of solar and wind energy;
￮ pace of uptake of electric vehicles;
￮ demand for biofuels;
￮ growth of the hydrogen economy;
￮ level of CCS available; 
￮ deployment of lower-carbon energy technologies; and
￮ global trade of oil and gas.
Management consideration of different climate change outcomes 
informs a range of areas, including, but not limited to, the setting of the 
long-term strategy, business planning, and investment and divestment 
decisions. The outcomes considered by management vary in relation 
to the extent and pace of the energy transition.
Carbon Management Framework (CMF)
Shell's CMF provides the structure and processes to drive 
delivery of Group carbon targets. The CMF seeks to manage 
and reduce emissions in a manner that is similar to how we use 
our financial framework. Carbon budgets are used as input and 
guidance for the annual business plan process. They act as an 
effective mechanism to maintain absolute emissions below 
a capped level and help drive a change in product mix. The 
carbon budgets are allocated to the businesses and enable 
trade-offs between emitting carbon and generating shareholder 
value to occur within those budgets. The CMF informs portfolio 
decisions and supports delivery of our decarbonisation targets.
For the 2024 Operating Plan cycle, our net carbon intensity 
(NCI) targets and 2030 oil products emissions ambition were 
translated into relevant budgets or targets for each business 
(see Greenhouse gas and energy management below). These 
budgets and targets were used by each business to optimise 
their operating plans. Performance against the annual NCI 
target, including the relative mix of products, is monitored and 
reviewed by the EC on a quarterly basis, facilitating corrective 
action if required.
Examples of how our decarbonisation targets are taken into 
account in fundamental decisions across the organisation 
include the use of carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon 
emitted), a key parameter considered in decision-making and 
when comparing different growth opportunities against each 
other within the various businesses.
Greenhouse gas and energy management
Each Shell entity and Shell-operated venture is responsible 
for the development of its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions 
and Energy Management Plan. Plans are in place for all 
significant assets.
Our Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management process sets 
out Shell's requirements for GHG reduction opportunities and 
portfolio choices to meet our carbon budgets and achieve 
our decarbonisation targets. These requirements allocate 
accountabilities for GHG and energy management within 
businesses, assets and projects, including responsibility for 
analysing our emissions, identifying improvement opportunities, 
and forecasting future performance. These requirements are 
applied to capital project delivery and through the asset-level 
annual business planning process, ensuring it is reflected in both 
opportunity realisation and strategic asset management planning.
A key aspect of the GHG and Energy Management process 
is the development of an energy efficiency and greenhouse gas 
reduction opportunity curve, economically assessed against the 
current and future costs of carbon. This information provides the 
basis for forecasts of absolute GHG emissions and associated 
intensities at the asset and project level. These forecasts are then 
aggregated to inform decisions on potential decarbonisation 
opportunities across our businesses.
The Shell Global Process Council for GHG and Energy 
Management, led by the Global Process Owner for GHG and 
including business and functional experts, meets regularly to 
evaluate opportunities for the ongoing improvement of 
processes, tools, communications, and capabilities needed 
within the businesses to achieve our decarbonisation aspirations.

Impact on strategic planning
The application of scenario analysis informs our assessment of the 
impact of a wide range of risks and opportunities, including climate- 
change-related issues, on our strategy and business planning at the 
Group and business levels. At the Group level, the potential impacts of 
the energy transition on our business model are discussed and assessed 
by the Board and the EC as part of the annual strategic and business 
planning cycle. This assessment allows us to challenge accepted ways 
of thinking, identify material risks and opportunities, and identify key 
dilemmas and trade-offs.
Key financial and non-financial components of 
business planning
The Board approves our annual business plan. The plan 
contains operational and financial metrics, and its objective 
is to drive the delivery of our strategy. 
Decarbonisation targets are key to our business planning 
process. Each business owner offers viable Scope 1, 2 and 3 
reduction opportunities as part of this process, in line with the 
CMF, see "Our approach to Sustainability" on page 127).
The business plan is underpinned by assumptions about internal 
and external parameters and includes: 
￮commodity prices;
￮ refining margins;
￮ production levels and product demand;
￮ exchange rates; 
￮ future carbon costs;
￮ the schedules of capital investment programmes; and 
￮ risks and opportunities that may have material impacts on 
free cash flow.
These assumptions are developed with input from our scenarios 
and internal estimates and outlooks. The level of uncertainty 
around these assumptions increases over longer time horizons.
Impact on business and financial planning
There is no single scenario that underpins Shell's business and 
financial planning. Our scenarios help develop our future oil and gas 
pricing outlooks. These outlooks take account of factors relating to the 
energy transition, such as potential changes in supply and demand (see 
details of scenario parameters above). The low-, mid- and high-pricing 
outlooks are prepared by a team of experts, reviewed by the EC and 
approved by the CEO and CFO. The mid-price outlook represents 
management's reasonable best estimate and is the basis for Shell's 
financial statements, Operating Plans and impairment testing. 
Shell's Operating Plan reflects Shell's strategy. We will continue to 
update our Operating Plan, price outlooks and assumptions as we 
move towards net-zero emissions by 2050.
As described in "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified 
by Shell over the short, medium and long term" on page 80, the
low-pricing outlooks could result in increased commercial, regulatory 
and societal risks. The prioritisation of these risks is described in "Risk 
management" on page 134. Given our net-zero target, the use of low-
pricing outlooks is part of our resilience testing and resulting actions. 
Our strategy and national net-zero commitments 
In accordance with UK Listing Rule 6.6.12G, we have taken into 
account the extent to which country-level net-zero commitments 
have been considered in developing our energy transition plans.
Our strategy aims to deliver a net-zero emissions energy 
business by 2050. The pace of the energy transition will be 
heavily influenced by government policy, creating a strong 
country and regional dimension in seeking to deliver the goals 
of the Paris Agreement. Our commitment is a global one and, 
as such, we look to deliver our strategy through a global lens.
We seek to translate our energy transition plans into specific 
targets and plans at a business segment level. We also seek to 
take capital deployment and portfolio decisions in the context 
of the integrated nature of our global operations. However, 
we continue to recognise the importance of engagement and 
collaboration in delivering the fundamental changes to the 
energy system that are required. This includes supporting and 
advocating for policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions 
and working with governments and other stakeholders in the 
development of policies that support the transition to a low-
carbon energy system. As national transition plans develop, 
consideration will be given to the impact on our operations 
and the associated implications for our energy transition plans.
Resilience of Shell's strategy to different climate-related 
scenarios 
Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the 
ability to reshape our portfolio as the energy system transforms. 
They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets.
As we work towards net-zero emissions, we continue to exercise focus
and discipline to optimise our capital allocation and operational 
expenditure, balancing energy security and demand, as well as internal 
and external transition considerations and opportunities. We will make 
disciplined choices about where we can create the most value for our 
investors and customers through the energy transition.

Cash capital expenditure monitors investing activities on a cash basis, 
excluding items such as lease additions which do not necessarily result 
in cash outflows in the period. The measure comprises the following 
lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Capital 
expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and 
Investments in equity securities. The reconciliation of "Capital 
expenditure" to "Cash capital expenditure" is presented in Note 7 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 268-273.

Total cash capital expenditure was lower in 2024 compared with 
2023 driven by project prioritisation and cost optimisation. Movements 
by category in 2024 versus 2023 were driven by:
￮Non-energy products: comparable year-on-year. 
￮ Low-carbon energy solutions: decreased by $3.2 billion compared 
with 2023. This reflects lower spend on renewable power 
generation projects and lower spend in the Marketing business, 
when compared with the significant inorganic growth investments in 
2023 (the acquisition of Nature Energy for nearly $2 billion and the 
roll-out of electric vehicle charging).
￮ LNG, gas and power marketing and trading: 25% higher spend in 
2024 compared with 2023 due to investments in LNG infrastructure 
projects and Renewable and Energy Solutions (two-unit combined-
cycle gas turbine power plant).
￮ Oil, oil products and other: 8% lower spend compared with 
2023 due to reductions in Marketing and Upstream (in deep water 
assets, including in the Gulf of America, partly offset by higher spend 
in Nigeria and the UK).
Cash capital expenditure* by segment for 2025 is expected to be 
around $7 billion for Upstream ($7.9 billion in 2024), around $6 
billion for Integrated Gas ($4.8 billion in 2024), in the range of $2-3 
billion for Marketing ($2.4 billion in 2024), around $3 billion for

Key aspects of Shell's financial resilience in the context of climate-
related impacts are assessed and described in more detail in Note 4
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". This describes how Shell 
has considered climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial 
statements and how this translates into the valuation of assets and 
measurement of liabilities. Shell's financial statements are based on 
reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's 
best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in 
the foreseeable future. 
Sensitivity analysis using external, and often normative, climate change 
scenarios has been performed for the period covering asset life cycles. 
If these different price outlooks were used, this would impact the 
recoverability of certain assets recognised in the "Consolidated 
Balance Sheet" as at December 31, 2024.
As there is no single scenario that underpins our Operating Plans, 
sensitivity analysis has been conducted using a range of key assumptions 
to test the resilience of our asset base. This includes (but is not limited to):
￮sensitivity analysis on asset carrying values using commodity price 
outlooks from external, and often normative, climate change scenarios;
￮ carbon price sensitivities;
￮ chemical and refining margins price sensitivities; and 
￮ discount rate sensitivities.
Strategic Report | Performance in the year | Our journey to net zero continued
88 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 91 ----
Commodity price sensitivities
Oil and gas prices are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's 
financial statements, with the mid-price outlook informed by Shell's 
scenario planning representing management's reasonable best 
estimate. Price outlooks reflect a broad range of factors, including, 
but not limited to, future supply and demand, and the pace of growth 
of low-carbon solutions. The scenarios have been selected to illustrate 
the resilience of the asset base under a range of possible outcomes, 
including the price implications arising from the ambitious IEA Net 
Zero Emissions scenario which provides a potential path for the 
global energy system (IEA NZE50) to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2050. Sensitivities of asset carrying values to prices are under 
the assumption that all other factors in the models used to calculate 
impacts remain unchanged. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed using price outlooks from:
1. Average prices from three 1.5-2°C external climate change 
scenarios: in view of the broad range of price outlooks across the 
various scenarios, the average of three external price outlooks was 
taken from IHS Markit/ACCS 2024; Woodmac WM AET-1.5 
degree; and IEA NZE 2050 (IEA NZE50).
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion and 
Upstream assets of $77 billion as at December 31, 2024, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $11-15 billion and $1-3 billion lower, 
respectively, than the carrying values as at December 31, 2024. 
2. Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: for this Shell's mid-price outlook is 
applied for the next 10 years. Because of greater uncertainty, the IEA 
normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied for the period after 
10 years. This gives less weight to the price-risk uncertainty in the first 
10 years reflected in the Operating Plan period and applies more risk 
to the more uncertain subsequent periods.
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion and 
Upstream assets of $77 billion as at December 31, 2024, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $7--10 billion and up to $1 billion 
lower, respectively, than the carrying values as at December 31, 
2024.
3. A 1.5°C scenario, derived from IEA NZE50: this priceline applies the 
IEA normative Net Zero Emissions scenario over the whole period 
under review and reflects the sensitivity to a pure net-zero emissions 
scenario from the IEA. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion and 
Upstream assets of $77 billion as at December 31, 2024, shows 
recoverable amounts that are $21-27 billion and $5-7 billion lower, 
respectively, than the carrying values as at December 31, 2024.
In addition, further sensitivities are provided of -10% or +10% to Shell's 
mid-price outlook, as an average percentage over the full period. 
A change of -10% or +10% to the mid-price outlook, as an average 
percentage over the full period, would result in around $5-9 billion 
impairment or some $2-5 billion impairment reversal, respectively, 
in Integrated Gas and Upstream as at December 31, 2024. 
Carbon pricing
We consider the potential costs associated with operational 
GHG emissions when we assess the resilience of projects. For 
each region, we have developed short-, medium- and long-term 
estimates of future costs of carbon. These are reviewed and 
updated annually. See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" for further details on our regional cost of carbon 
estimates. 
Up to 2030, costs for carbon emissions estimates are largely 
policy driven through emissions trading schemes or taxation 
which is levied by governments and which varies significantly 
on a country-by-country basis. Beyond 2030, where policy 
predictions are more challenging, the costs for carbon emissions 
are estimated based on the expected costs of abatement 
technologies required for 2050. The estimated cost is trending 
towards $50 to $230 per tonne (RT24), depending on the 
country, in 2050.
See "The resilience of Shell's strategy" on page 86 for more 
information on how carbon costs impact our resilience to 
climate-related risks, including sensitivity analysis.
See Shell's "Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report 
2024", which will be published in May 2025, for more 
information on Shell's advocacy across a range of issues 
including carbon pricing.
Carbon pricing and discount rate sensitivities
The risk of stranded assets may increase in a higher-carbon-price 
scenario. Sensitivities of our asset carrying values to carbon prices 
have been based on the IEA NZE50 scenario to illustrate the resilience 
of asset carrying values to higher long-term carbon prices than those 
included in the Shell mid-price outlook.
Applying the IEA NZE50 carbon price scenario to Integrated Gas 
assets of $74 billion and Upstream assets of $77 billion, up to the end 
of life of these assets, shows recoverable amounts that are $1-2 billion 
and up to $1 billion lower, respectively, than the carrying values as at 
December 31, 2024.
Applying the IEA NZE50 carbon price scenario to Chemicals and 
Products assets of $38 billion shows recoverable amounts that are up 
to $1-2 billion lower than the carrying values as at December 31, 2024. 
For Chemicals and Products, increased carbon costs could potentially 
be recovered partially through increased product sales prices.
See "Carbon pricing" above for more information on our carbon 
price assumptions.

---- Page 92 ----
The discount rate applied for impairment testing is based on a 
nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and 
is determined at 7.5%, except for power activities in the Renewables 
and Energy Solutions segment where 6% is applied. The discount rate 
includes generic systematic risk for energy transition risk. In addition, 
cash flow projections applied in individual assets include specific asset 
risks, including risk of transition. An increase in generic systematic 
energy transition risk could lead to a higher WACC and consequently 
to a higher discount rate to be applied in impairment testing. We have 
used a 1% shift in discount rate for sensitivity analysis purposes as 
an indicator of the resilience of our asset base to incremental 
increases in our cost of capital.
An increase of the WACC of 1% under the assumption that all other 
factors in the models used to calculate recoverability of carrying values 
remain unchanged would lead to a change in the carrying value of 
$1-3 billion for Integrated Gas and Upstream and no significant 
impairment in other segments.
See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 255-265 for further 
information on climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial statements.
Delivering progress in the energy transition 
To ensure the resilience of our strategy, our responses to the risks 
and opportunities identified are: 
￮delivery through our integrated business model;
￮ decarbonisation of our energy value chains and operations; and
￮ a focus on demand-driven decarbonisation – recognising that 
we need to work with our customers to identify low-carbon energy 
solutions for their energy demands in the sectors where we have 
competitive advantages.
Our integrated approach allows us to withstand volatility in oil and 
gas markets. Our financial framework aims to enhance shareholder 
distributions, maintain discipline in capital allocation and targets a 
strong credit investment grade rating. 
￮In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) business. We plan to grow LNG sales by 4-5% a 
year through to 2030. LNG provides energy security and flexibility 
because it can be easily transported to places where it is needed 
most. Gas is a critical fuel in the energy transition and plays an 
important role as a lower-carbon alternative to coal for industry, 
and provides grid stability alongside wind and solar power in 
electricity generation.
￮ In Upstream, we continue to focus on more value and less emissions. 
The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class 
deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water 
platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. As 
we work towards net-zero emissions, we will continue to approach 
capital and carbon allocation with discipline and focus. 
￮ In Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are making 
clear choices and changes to enable this business to thrive through 
the energy transition. We are focusing on developing low-carbon 
energy and solutions where we have competitive advantages and 
are starting to see increasing demand. We are focusing on value 
over volume across all our businesses in Downstream, Renewables 
and Energy Solutions, while driving down our emissions and helping 
to drive down our customers' emissions.
￮ We are progressing the repurposing of our energy and chemical 
parks; these key focused assets allow us to underpin our 
hydrocarbon energy sales and the sales of lower carbon energy 
products. Our energy transition plans for this decade across our 
Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions business are focu
sed 
on: growing our electric vehicle charging business; investing in 
biofuels; continuing to grow our integrated power positions, and 
developing technologies related to CCS and carbon removals.
See "Outlook" on page 16.
Our research and development (R&D) activities are an important 
contributor to achieving our net-zero emissions target. They are an 
important way to address the technology risk as mentioned in 
"Transition risks" on page 81 and "Transition opportunities" on page 84. 
In 2024, our R&D expenditure on projects that contributed to 
decarbonisation was around $497 million, representing about 
45% of our total R&D spend, compared with around 49% in 2023. 
This includes expenditure on reducing GHG emissions: 
￮from our own operations, for example, by improving energy 
efficiency and electrification; 
￮ from the fuels and other products we sell to our customers - for 
example, biofuels, synthetic fuels and products made from low-
carbon electricity, and hydrogen produced using renewable sources;
￮ by carbon capture, utilisation and storage applied to hydrogen 
production from natural gas and other carbon emissions; 
￮ by researching nature-based solutions to offset emissions; and
￮ for our customers, through renewable power generation, storage,
e-mobility and other electrification solutions.
Examples of R&D areas other than decarbonisation include safety, 
performance products, such as lubricants and polymers, automation 
and artificial intelligence.
Decarbonising our value chains and operations
We seek to base the decarbonisation of our value chains and 
operations on an understanding of the decarbonisation strategies 
and plans of our customers and users of our energy products. 
We are focused on decarbonising our own operations by:
￮making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in 
low-carbon intensity projects, decommissioning plants, divesting 
assets, while sustaining our oil production with increasingly lower 
carbon intensity;
￮ progressing the repurposing of our energy and chemicals parks;
￮ improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
￮ developing CCS for some of our facilities.
If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset 
any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon 
mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate or to meet 
local regulatory requirements.

We have set an interim target to achieve a 50% reduction in absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control by 2030 on a 
net basis, when compared with 2016.
We set a target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-operated 
assets by 2025 [A]. With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC has 
ceased routine flaring of associated gas, with the completion of 
essential gas capture projects and the shut-in of remaining facilities that 
do not yet meet the applicable emissions standards. We have therefore 
met our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-operated 
assets by 2025 as of this date. We also aim to maintain methane 
emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% and 
achieve near-zero methane emissions intensity by 2030. 
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 
2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
See "Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions" on page 103.
Supporting our customers in achieving net-zero emissions
The transport sector is by far the largest market for our oil products. We 
are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive 
the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and 
ships. Changes to the supply of energy products and decarbonising the 
energy system require structural changes in the end-use of energy. 
This requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment 
so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch 
to low- and zero-carbon energy. For example, replacing internal 
combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles, converting heavy-
duty transport to biofuels such as renewable diesel, and, in the future, 
hydrogen and its derivatives.
Such structural changes are expected to help to trigger transitions 
along the supply chain of individual sectors and across sectors, 
including the production of energy and emissions over time. The IEA 
estimates that these changes in the end use of energy will require 
substantial investment. 
The World Energy Outlook 2024 report by the IEA includes an 
estimate that by 2035 for every one US dollar spent on fossil fuels, a 
further $20 will need to be spent on clean energy (low-emissions fuels, 
and energy-efficient and low-emissions power) under the NZE50 
Scenario. 
We are seeking and will continue to seek to change the mix of energy 
products we sell to our customers as their needs for energy change. 
Emissions resulting from customer use of our energy products make up 
a large proportion of Shell's reported emissions. We believe we can 
make the greatest contribution to the energy transition by helping to 
enable our customers to switch to low-carbon energy products and 
services. We are working to:
￮develop low- and zero-carbon alternatives to traditional fuel, 
including biofuels, and other low- and zero-carbon gases;
￮ provide more renewable power solutions to customers by growing 
our portfolio in select markets;
￮ work with customers across different sectors to help them 
decarbonise their use of energy, for example by substituting the 
use of coal with LNG; and
￮ address any remaining emissions from conventional fuels with 
solutions such as CCS and high-quality carbon credits.

Energy transition in action - selection of portfolio changes and actions in 2024
Reducing emissions from the products we sell
By the end of 2024, the number of Shell-branded electric vehicle 
charge points was almost 73,000 compared with 54,000 in 2023. 
We reached our goal of installing 70,000 public electric vehicle 
charge points globally by 2025 one year ahead of schedule.
Shell and our non-operated joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 
44%) are, together, one of the world's largest blenders and 
distributors of biofuels. In 2024, Raízen commissioned the second 
and third of eight world-scale second-generation biofuel plants, 
which it aims to build in Brazil, and its first biomethane plant to 
produce RNG made from waste in sugar ethanol production. 
In March 2024, Hollandse Kust Noord, our offshore wind park 
in the Netherlands (Shell interest 79.9%), achieved commercial 
operations. 
In March 2024, we started operations at Shell Downstream Bovarius, 
which is one of two facilities at the Bettencourt Dairies in Wendell, 
Idaho, USA, where we are converting dairy manure to RNG. Bovarius 
is expected to produce around 400,000 MMBtu a year of RNG. The 
second facility, Shell Downstream Friesian, is expected to produce 
around 350,000 MMBtu a year of RNG and operations are expected 
to start in 2025.
In September 2024, our Northern Lights joint venture (Shell interest 
33.3%) with Equinor and TotalEnergies completed the onshore and 
offshore facilities for the world's first carbon transport and storage 
project in Norway. The first shipments are expected in 2025. 
Northern Lights has the capacity to store around 1.5 million tonnes 
of CO2 per year.
In April 2024, we opened our bioLNG liquefaction plant at the 
Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland. This can produce 
100,000 tonnes of bioLNG per annum, which will help around 
5,000 LNG trucks a year reduce their carbon emissions.
In July 2024, we announced that we had paused on-site 
construction work at the biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and 
Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands to assess the most 
commercial way forward for the project. 
Nature Energy is one of Europe's largest producers of RNG. In 
2024, Nature Energy opened its first biogas plant in France. The 
Sécalia plant is operated in partnership with the Dijon Céréales 
consortium of 150 farmers. It is France's largest renewable gas 
plant with annual production of 230 GWh of biogas. Together 
with its partners, Nature Energy also owns and operates 13 biogas 
plants in Denmark and one in the Netherlands.
In October 2024, we announced the acquisition of RISEC 
Holdings, LLC (RISEC), which owns a 609-megawatt (MW) two-
unit combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Rhode Island, USA. 
RISEC's combined-cycle gas turbine power plant supplies power to 
the ISO New England power market, where demand is expected 
to increase due to growing decarbonisation efforts in sectors such 
as home heating and transport.
Rotterdam-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor 
(GDSC) partners conducted a successful pilot for the bunkering 
of mass-balanced liquefied bio-methane (LBM) at the Port of 
Rotterdam in October 2024. A total of 100 tonnes of mass-
balanced LBM was supplied by Shell to CMA CGM's liquefied 
natural gas-powered. 
In December 2024, a consortium led by Eku Energy and Shell 
Energy successfully completed the Rangebank Battery Energy 
Storage System (BESS) in Melbourne's Rangebank Business Park, 
marking the second-largest battery storage project in Victoria. 
With a capacity of 200 MW and 400 MWh of storage, the 
facility can power up to 80,000 homes.
Reducing emissions from our own operations
In January 2024, we announced our investment decision to 
convert the hydrocracker at our Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rheinland in Germany into a unit that will produce premium base 
oils. The hydrocracker at the Wesseling site near Cologne will stop 
processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel in 2025. The 
planned changes are expected to reduce Shell's Scope 1 and 2 
carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year.
In May 2024, the Petrobras-operated Atapu consortium (Shell 
interest 16.7%) announced a final investment decision (FID) for the 
Atapu-2 project. The new unit is expected to feature all-electric 
capability, aimed at lowering carbon intensity for production 
processes.
In June 2024, we took an FID for Polaris, a carbon capture project 
at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Scotford in Alberta, 
Canada. Polaris is designed to capture approximately 650,000 
tonnes of CO2 annually from the Shell-owned Scotford refinery 
and chemicals complex. 
We also took an FID to proceed with the Atlas Carbon Storage 
Hub which will store CO2 captured by the Polaris project. Polaris 
and Atlas will build on the success of the Quest carbon capture 
and storage (CCS) facility at Scotford, which has safely captured 
and stored more than nine million tonnes of CO2 since 2015 that 
would otherwise have been released into the atmosphere.
In July 2024, we signed an agreement to invest in the Abu Dhabi 
National Oil Company's (ADNOC) Ruwais LNG project through 
a 10% participating interest. The deal is still subject to completion. 
The Ruwais LNG facility is set to have an electric-powered 
liquefaction system and will utilise access to a renewable power 
supply. This design supports lower operational emissions compared 
to traditional gas-powered LNG facilities. 
In July 2024, we took the final investment decision to build 
REFHYNE II, a 100 MW electrolyser to produce renewable 
hydrogen, in Germany. We plan to use this hydrogen to partially 
decarbonise the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland.
In October 2024, Shell NBS formed a joint venture with New 
Forests Company: Tausi Forests Limited. Operating in Tanzania 
and Uganda, Tausi is dedicated to establishing certified 
commercial plantations and to initiating afforestation projects, 
creating reforestation and restoration carbon credits, and 
enhancing climate resilience, community well-being, and 
biodiversity in the areas that it operates in.

Our climate-related metrics and targets
This section describes our performance against our climate-related targets and ambition, including those reflected in the remuneration of senior 
management and employees.
[A]  This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased routine flaring. 
Our target is therefore met. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[B] On an intensity basis. Methane intensity is measured separately for oil and gas assets with marketed gas (gas, LNG and GTL available for sale) and assets without marketed gas (oil and gas 
assets where gas is reinjected).
[C] Average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products we sell, on an equity boundary, net of carbon credits. Estimated total GHG emissions included in NCI reflect well-to-wheel 
emissions associated with energy products sold by Shell. This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. In 
2024, we revised the 2016 baseline NCI values and other historical NCI values. As a result, the percentage reduction achieved in 2023 was revised from 6.3% to 7.7%. (See "NCI baseline 
and restatement policy" on page 98).
[D] In March 2024, we set an ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15–20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions 
from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.

Metrics used by Shell to assess climate-related risks 
and opportunities in line with our strategy and risk 
management process 
This section sets out the key metrics we use to track progress against 
our energy transition targets and ambition. These metrics are as 
follows. 
￮Metrics related to our own operations:
– absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions under operational control, 
with a 2016 baseline; and
– routine flaring and methane emissions intensity under our 
operational control.
￮ Metrics related to emissions from the products we sell:
– the NCI of the energy products we sell (equity basis), with a 2016 
baseline; and
– customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, 
Category 11, equity basis), with a 2021 baseline.
￮ Performance indicators for the energy transition performance 
condition reflected in the remuneration of senior management 
and employees as set out in "Linking Shell's emissions targets to 
remuneration" on page 104. 
￮ Additional metrics associated with the resilience of Shell's strategy to 
climate-related risks and opportunities, including information on 
capital allocation between our business segments and the sensitivity 
of our assets to carbon pricing, discount rate and commodity price 
assumptions as set out in "Resilience of Shell's strategy to different 
climate-related scenarios" on page 86.
￮ Metrics and targets in respect of climate-related environmental risks 
as set out in "Metrics and targets in respect of climate-related 
environmental risks" page 101.
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and related risks 
In assessing progress against our target to be a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050, we report our performance against Scope 1, 
2 and 3 emissions. 
See "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over the short, medium and 
long term" on pages 80-84.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
In 2024, total combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (net) from 
assets and activities under Shell operational control were 58 million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), reflecting a 30% reduction 
compared with 2016, the base year for our target to halve these 
emissions by 2030.
Total combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (net) were 2% higher 
compared with 2023 due to higher utilisation and production, offset 
by reductions from abatement projects.
Drivers of Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Gross direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) 
were stable in 2024 compared with 2023, at 50 million tonnes 
of CO2e, as the effect of higher Chemicals utilisation and Integrated 
Gas production was offset by reductions from GHG abatement 
projects and reduction activities.
Gross indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2, operational control boundary, 
using a market-based method) increased from 7 million tonnes of CO2e, 
in 2023 to 8 million tonnes CO2e in 2024. This increase was driven by 
higher electricity consumption and reduced purchases of renewable 
electricity in Australia following regulatory changes for purchasing and 
reporting renewable energy. We present examples of our energy 
efficiency projects on page 108.
In 2024, carbon credits were used for compliance with the 
requirements of the Australian Safeguard Mechanism, resulting in an 
offset of 0.1 million tonnes CO2e related to Scope 1 emissions under 
our operational control.

[G] In 2024, carbon credits were used for compliance with the requirements of the Australian Safeguard Mechanism, resulting in an offset of 0.1 million tonnes CO2e related to Scope 1 emissions 
under our operational control.
[H] In 2024, category Other represents the regulatory change for purchasing and reporting renewable energy in Australia and inclusion of emissions from Shell-owned, but third-party operated 
Mobility retail stations.
Routine flaring
Routine flaring of associated gas occurs during normal oil production 
where it is not possible to transport the gas to market, use it on-site or 
reinject it.
Routine flaring from The Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
Nigeria Limited (SPDC) was 0.1 million in 2024, comparable with 
2023.
With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC has ceased routine flaring of 
associated gas, with the completion of essential gas capture projects, 
such as the Forcados Yokri Gas Project, and the shut-in of remaining 
facilities from which gas cannot be transported to market. We have 
therefore met our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-
operated assets by 2025 as of this date.
Total routine and non-routine flaring at our Integrated Gas and 
Upstream facilities was 0.6 million tonnes in 2024, compared with 
0.7 million tonnes in 2023. Around 50% of total flaring in 2024 
occurred in assets operated by SPDC and SNEPCo. 
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance, 
a consortium of five companies. SPDC will continue to operate the 
SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV [A]) on behalf of all the joint-venture 
partners, who together will continue to make decisions relating to work 
programmes for the SPDC JV's assets and infrastructure.
[A] The SPDC JV comprises SPDC (30%), the government-owned NNPC (55%), Total 
Exploration and Production Nigeria Ltd (10%) and Nigeria Agip Oil Company Ltd (5%).

Total hydrocarbons flared in routine flaring 0.1 0.1 0.1 1.1
[A] Routine flaring of associated gas occurs during normal oil production where it is not 
possible to transport the gas to market, use it on site or reinject it.
Methane intensity
In 2024, we continued to deliver methane emissions intensities well 
below our 0.2% target, with overall methane emissions intensity at 
0.04% for Shell-operated oil and gas assets with marketed gas and 
0.001% for Shell-operated oil and gas assets without marketed gas.
Total methane emissions from assets under Shell operational control 
(including Integrated Gas and Upstream, and Downstream, 
Renewables and Energy Solutions assets) were 33 thousand tonnes in 
2024 compared with 41 thousand tonnes in 2023 due to lower venting 
(e.g. in 2023 venting occurred due to the maintenance of our Prelude 
floating LNG asset and operational issues in assets operated by 
Sarawak Shell Berhad).
We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry 
best practice. Methane emissions include those from unintentional 
leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares 
and turbines.

Scope 3 and NCI
NCI performance
In 2024, Shell's NCI was 71 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 1.4% decrease from the previous 
year and a 9.0% reduction compared with the 2016 baseline. We therefore met our interim target to reduce our NCI by 9-12% in 2024. The 
decrease in our NCI in 2024 was mainly achieved through a reduction in sales of oil products, continued growth in power sales and a reduction 
in the average intensity of the oil products we sell.

[B] We measure our NCI performance compared with a 2016 baseline. The NCI targets and baseline are not adjusted for the impact of acquisitions and divestments, which could have 
a material impact on meeting the NCI targets.
[C] In 2024, we revised the 2016 baseline NCI values from 79gCO 2e/MJ (g) to 78g. The 2022 and 2023 values were revised from 76g to 75g and from 74g to 72g respectively. (See "NCI 
baseline and restatement policy" on page 98.
[D] Volume of energy products sold, aggregated on an energy basis, with power represented as fossil equivalent. Energy products consist of energy oil products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, fuel 
oil and LPG), GTL, biofuels, liquefied natural gas, pipeline gas and power. 
[E] In 2024, consistent with revisions of NCI values, we revised the estimated total energy delivered by Shell from 16.07 trillion (10^12) MJ (t MJ) to 16.13t MJ for 2023, from 16.29t MJ to 16.34t 
MJ for 2022 and from 20.93t MJ to 20.80t MJ for 2016. (See "NCI baseline and restatement policy" on page 98).
[F] In 2024, consistent with revisions of NCI values, we revised the estimated total GHG emissions included in NCI (net) from 1,185 million tonnes CO 2e (mt) to 1,158mt for 2023, from 1,240mt to 
1,220mt for 2022 and from 1,645 to 1,615mt for 2016. (See "NCI baseline and restatement policy" on page 98).
[G] Estimated total GHG emissions included in NCI (net) are the product of the NCI and the total energy delivered by Shell. Adding emissions offset using carbon credits gives the Estimated total 
GHG emissions included in NCI (gross).
[H] In 2024, consistent with revisions of NCI values, we revised the estimated total GHG emissions (gross) from 1,205 million tonnes CO2e (mt) to 1,178mt for 2023, from 1,244mt to 1,225mt for 
2022 and from 1,645mt to 1,615mt for 2016. (See "NCI baseline and restatement policy" on page 98).
As part of our strategy, we aim to increase the share of low-carbon 
products in our energy product sales, which is the biggest driver for 
reducing our NCI.
 
Share of estimated total energy delivered per energy 
product type [A, B, C]
[A] Percentage of delivered energy may not add up to 100% because of rounding.
[B] Total volume of energy products sold, aggregated on an energy basis (lower heating 
value) with power represented as fossil equivalents.
[C] In 2024, consistent with revisions of NCI values, the share of energy delivered through 
sales of biofuels was revised from 1% to 2% in 2023 and 2022. The share delivered 
through gas sales was revised from 20% to 19% for 2023. See "NCI baseline and 
restatement policy" on page 98.
Our ability to change the emissions intensity of each energy product 
varies, depending on the product type: 
￮Hydrocarbon fuels - emissions from end use by customers are by 
far the biggest contributors to the carbon intensity of the product. 
As a result, the emissions intensity of hydrocarbon fuels is expected 
to stay relatively unchanged over time. This is why we are focused 
on helping our customers decarbonise.
￮ Biofuels - can vary significantly in intensity depending on the 
feedstock and production process used. 
￮ Power - the emissions intensity of power can be highly variable 
depending on how it has been generated. The proportion of our 
renewable power sales and the generation mix in countries where 
we sell power to the market both affect Shell's overall power mix 
and its resulting emissions intensity.
We sell more energy products than we produce ourselves. Therefore, 
when we calculate our emissions, we include emissions from energy 
products that we produce ourselves and from the products that we 
purchase from others for resale. This is reflected in the scope for 
calculation of our emissions shown in the chart on page 99.

Drivers of absolute Scope 3 emissions change in 2024 
Scope 3 emissions associated with our energy product sales were 1,084 
million tonnes CO2e, compared with 1,123 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, 
driven by lower sales of oil products.
Emissions from Scope 3 categories 1, 3, 9 and 11, related to the sale of 
energy products, are the most significant categories for Shell. Emissions 
from the use of our energy products (Category 11) form the largest 
component of our indirect Scope 3 emissions. As we sell more products 
than we produce or refine ourselves, the emissions associated with the 
products we purchase from third parties are also material, as reported 
under Category 1 for hydrocarbon products such as oil products, gas 
and LNG, and Category 3 for power. Although quantitatively less 
significant, emissions reported under Category 9 are significant to 
Shell for consistency with the boundaries of our net carbon intensity 
measure. Other Scope 3 categories have been assessed to be 
quantitatively and qualitatively insignificant.

Drivers of absolute Scope 3 Category 11 oil products 
emissions change in 2024
In 2024, Scope 3 Category 11 emissions from the use of our oil 
products were 491 million tonnes CO2e, a reduction of 5.0% compared 
with 2023. This reduction was driven by lower sales in our Mobility and 
Products businesses.
At the end of 2024, we achieved a reduction of 13.7% compared with 
2021, and are progressing towards our ambition to reduce customer 
emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) by 
15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021.

Carbon credits
In 2024, Shell accounted for the retirement of 17.3 million carbon 
credits, of which 16.4 million were related to our NCI (including 2.4 
million linked to the sale of energy products).
Of our total carbon credit retirements for 2024, 74% were certified by 
the Verra, Verified Carbon Standard Program (VCS), 10% by the ACR

Basis of preparation
NCI
Shell's NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volumes, 
of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and 
reported using Shell's Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. 
NCI objective
Shell's NCI provides an annual measure of the life-cycle emissions 
intensity of the portfolio of energy products sold. The intended use 
of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon 
intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. NCI measures emissions 
associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 
baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and 
changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products such as biofuels 
and renewable electricity. 
NCI definition
The NCI is calculated on a life-cycle basis and as such includes GHG 
emissions – on an equity basis – from several sources, including: 
￮direct GHG emissions from Shell operations;
￮ indirect GHG emissions from the generation of energy consumed 
by Shell; and
￮ indirect GHG emissions from the use of the products we sell.
The NCI is not a mathematical derivation of total emissions divided 
by total energy, nor is it an inventory of absolute emissions. It is a 
weighted average of the life-cycle CO2 intensities of different energy 
products, normalising them to the same point relative to their final 
enduse. The use of a consistent functional unit, grams of carbon dioxide 
equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ), allows like-for-like comparisons 
and the aggregation of individual life-cycle intensities for a range of 
energy products including renewable power.
Emissions from other parts of the product life cycle are also included, 
such as those from the extraction, transport and processing of crude 
oil, gas or other feedstocks and the distribution of products to our 
customers. Also included are emissions from parts of this life cycle not 
owned by Shell, such as the extraction of oil and gas processed by 
Shell but not produced by Shell; or from the production of oil products 
and electricity marketed by Shell that have not been processed or 
generated at a Shell facility.
We also take into account emissions offset through the use of carbon 
credits and mitigation actions such as the use of CCS technology.
See "Scope of NCI" on page 99 for details of the supply chains and 
steps in the product life cycles that are included in the Net Carbon 
Footprint methodology.
The following GHG emissions are not included in the NCI:
￮ emissions from production, processing, use and end-of-life treatment 
of non-energy products, such as chemicals and lubricants;
￮ emissions from third-party processing of sold intermediate products, 
such as the manufacture of plastics from feedstocks sold by Shell;
￮ emissions associated with the construction and decommissioning of 
production and manufacturing facilities;
￮ emissions associated with the production of fuels purchased to 
generate energy on-site at a Shell facility;
￮ other indirect emissions from waste generated in operations, business 
travel, employee commuting, transmission and distribution losses 
associated with imported electricity, franchises and investments; and
￮ emissions from capital goods, defined by the GHG Protocol as 
including fixed assets or property, plant and equipment, and other 
goods and services not related to purchased energy feedstocks 
sourced from third parties or energy products manufactured by 
third parties and sold by Shell.
The NCI calculation uses Shell's energy product sales volumes data, 
as disclosed in this Report. This excludes certain sales volumes such as:
￮certain contracts held for trading purposes reported net rather than 
gross. Business-specific methodologies to net volumes have been 
applied in oil products and pipeline gas and power. Paper trades 
that do not result in physical product delivery are excluded; and 
￮ retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under 
trademark licensing agreements.
The energy products included in the NCI calculation are oil products, 
(gasoline, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil and LPG), GTL, biofuels, LNG, 
pipeline gas and power. 
We review the NCI methodology annually to ensure it reflects 
changing energy products, relevant data inputs and simplification 
opportunities. See our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology 
documentation on shell.com for further information.
NCI baseline and restatement policy
We measure our NCI performance compared with a 2016 baseline. 
The NCI targets and baseline are not adjusted for the impact of 
acquisitions and divestments, which could have a material impact on 
meeting the NCI targets. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated as a 
result of changes in estimates with a cumulative impact of 2% or more 
on the NCI value in any historically disclosed year.
In 2024, the 2% cumulative restatement threshold was met, triggered 
by changes in external data sources for the third-party upstream and 
refining intensities used in our calculation of life-cycle product 
intensities. 
Accordingly NCI values were revised for the following years:
￮ 2016: from 79g to 78gCO2e/MJ (Baseline)
￮ 2017: from 79g to 78gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2018: from 79g to 78gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2019: from 78g to 77gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2020: from 75g to 74gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2021: from 77g to 76gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2022: from 76g to 75gCO2e/MJ
￮ 2023: from 74g to 72gCO2e/MJ 
These changes did not impact the NCI performance outcomes 
compared with interim reduction targets in 2022 and 2023 or 
preceding years. Compared with the revised 2016 baseline, the 
percentage reduction achieved in 2022 remains 3.8%, within the 
target of 3-4% for that year. The percentage reduction achieved in 
2023 was revised from 6.3% to 7.7%, still within the target of 6–8% 
for that year.

Basis of preparation – absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions
We follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of GHG emissions:
￮Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources under Shell's 
operational control.
￮ Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased 
energy consumed by Shell assets under operational control.
￮ Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions 
associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.
GHG emissions comprise CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and 
nitrogen trifluoride, with CO2 and methane being the most significant 
contributors. 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Our GHG inventory is prepared in line with the requirements 
outlined in the ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with Guidance at the 
Organizational Level for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions and Removals and the GHG Protocol's Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
In line with external standards, we aggregate GHG emissions into 
tonnes of CO2 equivalent by applying global warming potential 
(GWP) factors to non-CO2 GHGs. With effect from 2023, these factors 
are taken from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) over a 100-
year time period, as required by the UK Government GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting. GHG emissions are aggregated and 
consolidated from emission source. All operated assets are included in 
our GHG inventory.
Scope 1 emissions 
All significant sources were included in our Scope 1 inventory. Sources 
included comprise: 
￮combustion of carbon-containing fuels in stationary equipment
(e.g. boilers and gas turbines) for energy generation; 
￮ combustion of carbon-containing fuels in mobile equipment
(e.g. trucks, vessels and mobile rigs);
￮ flares;
￮ venting and emissions from industrial processes (e.g. hydrogen plants 
and catalytic cracking units); and 
￮ fugitive emissions, including piping and equipment leaks and
non-routine events. 
Our Scope 1 emissions follow the GHG Protocol guidance. As a result,
the following are not included in our reported Scope 1 emissions:
￮CO2 emissions from biogenic sources such as biofuels or biomass 
(however methane and nitrous oxide emissions from biogenic 
sources are included); 
￮ captured CO2 that was subsequently sold or otherwise transferred 
to third parties;
￮ CO2 captured and sequestered using CCS technologies; and 
￮ carbon credits.
Scope 2 emissions
All significant sources were included in our Scope 2 inventory. Sources 
included comprise indirect emissions from purchased and consumed 
electricity, steam and heat. We did not identify any assets with 
imported cooling or compressed air used for energy purposes.
Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market- and location-based 
methods separately as defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance. Scope 2 emissions are presented on a gross basis.
Carbon credits
Our target to halve total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 has 
been set on a net basis, including emissions offset by carbon credits. 
In 2024, carbon credits were used for compliance with the 
requirements of the Australian Safeguard Mechanism, resulting in an 
offset of 0.1 million tonnes CO2e related to Scope 1 emissions under 
our operational control.
Baseline and restatement policy
We measure our total combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
performance compared with a 2016 baseline, on a net basis. The 2016 
baseline may be recalculated if an acquisition or a divestment has an 
impact of more than 10% on total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. There was 
no such event in 2024.
Scope 3 emissions
This Report provides Scope 3 emissions associated with our energy 
product sales. Emissions were consolidated using the equity boundary 
approach. Under this approach, we reported the Shell share of 
emissions from energy products sold, including those sourced from 
third parties.
Emissions from Scope 3 categories 1, 3, 9 and 11, related to the sale of 
energy products, are the most significant categories for Shell. Emissions 
from the use of our energy products (Category 11) form the largest 
component of our indirect Scope 3 emissions. As we sell more products 
than we produce or refine ourselves, the emissions associated with the 
products we purchase from third parties are also material, as reported 
under Category 1 for hydrocarbon products such as oil products, gas 
and LNG, and Category 3 for power. Although quantitatively less 
significant, emissions reported under Category 9 are significant to 
Shell for consistency with the boundaries of our net carbon intensity 
measure. Other Scope 3 categories have been assessed to be 
quantitatively and qualitatively insignificant. 
Consistent with our revisions of NCI historical data, we revised Scope 3 
emissions under Categories 1, 9 and 11, as applicable, for years 2016, 
2022 and 2023 in this Report. There was no change to previously 
published Scope 3 emissions Category 11 Oil products. See "NCI 
baseline and restatement policy" on page 98 for details.
The calculation of Scope 3 Category 11 emissions uses energy product 
sales volumes data, disclosed in this Report where relevant. These sales 
volumes exclude certain contracts held for trading purposes and 
reported net rather than gross. Business-specific methodologies have 
been applied to net volumes of oil products, pipeline gas and power. 
Paper trades that do not result in physical product delivery are excluded. 
Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark 
licensing agreements are not included in the sales volumes reported by 
Shell and are therefore excluded from Scope 3 emissions. 
Scope 3, Category 1: purchased goods and services
This category includes well-to-tank emissions from purchased third-party 
unfinished and finished energy products excluding electricity (which is 
reported separately under Category 3: fuel and energy-related 
activities and not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2). Emissions from 
purchased non-energy products are not included. 
Emissions in this category are estimated using well-to-tank emission 
factors for crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products (such as gasoline, 
and diesel), LNG and biofuels. Because the emission factors include 
transport, we do not estimate emissions from the transport of purchased 
third-party products separately. 
In 2024, Category 1 emissions were revised for the following years:
￮ 2016: from 172 million tonnes CO2e to 179 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2020: from 147 million tonnes CO2e to 150 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2021: from 147 million tonnes CO2e to 142 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2022: from 144 million tonnes CO2e to 136 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2023: from 154 million tonnes CO2e to 130 million tonnes CO2e

Scope 3, Category 3: fuel and energy-related activities 
(not included in Scope 1 and 2)
This category includes well-to-wire emissions from purchased third-party 
electricity sold by Shell, calculated using a market-based method. 
Emissions are not adjusted for any potential double-counting of sold 
natural gas that may have been used for generating this electricity.
This category does not include:
￮ indirect emissions from the generation of imported energy (steam, 
heat or electricity consumed by our assets). These emissions 
are reported separately as Scope 2 emissions; and
￮ well-to-tank emissions from purchased electricity, steam and heat 
consumed by our assets (i.e. Scope 3 emissions from the extraction, 
refining and transport of primary fuels before their use in the 
generation of electricity or steam).
Following the NCI restatement in 2024, Scope 3, Category 3 
emissions remained unchanged at:
￮For 2016 at 89 million tonnes CO2e
￮ For 2020 at 103 million tonnes CO2e
￮ For 2021 at 136 million tonnes CO2e
￮ For 2022 at 115 million tonnes CO2e
￮ For 2023 at 112 million tonnes CO2e
Scope 3, Category 9: downstream transport and distribution
This category includes estimated emissions from the transport and 
distribution of energy products produced or refined by Shell. It does not 
include the emissions associated with transporting third-party products, 
which are included in Scope 3, Category 1. To avoid double counting 
across emission scopes, emissions from transport activities which are 
already included in our Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions are excluded 
from this category.
In 2024, Category 9 emissions were revised for the year 2022, 
from 5 million tonnes CO2e to 3 million tonnes CO2e. Scope 3 
Category 9 emissions remained unchanged for 2021 (at 6 million 
tonnes CO2e) and for 2023 (at 3 million tonnes CO2e). An estimate 
of Scope 3 Category 9 was not performed for 2016 and 2020.
Scope 3, Category 11: use of sold products
This category includes estimated emissions from the use of sold 
energy products, such as LNG, GTL, pipeline gas, refined oil products 
and biofuels. These emissions relate to products manufactured and 
sold by Shell and third-party products sold by Shell.
This category does not include non-energy products that may have 
been combusted during use (for example, lubricants).
In 2024, Category 11 emissions were revised for the following years:
￮ 2016: from 1,284 million tonnes CO2e to 1,252 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2020: from 1,054 million tonnes CO2e to 1,028 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2021: from 1,010 million tonnes CO2e to 963 million tonnes CO2e
￮ 2022: from 910 million tonnes CO2e to 909 million tonnes CO2e
For 2023, Scope 3 Category 11 remained unchanged at 878 million 
tonnes CO2e.
Revisions did not impact Category 11 emissions from the use of oil 
products. 
Biogenic emissions
CO2 emissions from biogenic sources related to the combustion of sold 
biofuels are estimated but, in line with GHG Protocol guidance and 
ISO 14064-1:2018, not included in Scope 3, Category 11. Methane 
and nitrous oxide emissions from biogenic sources are included in 
Scope 3, Category 11. 
It is assumed that the presence of biogenic emissions associated 
with other Scope 3 categories is negligible at present.
Customer emissions from the use of our oil products
Our ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil 
products is a subset of Scope 3, Category 11 emissions, focusing 
on the use of refined oil products.
We measure these emission reductions compared with a 2021 
baseline. The 2021 baseline may be recalculated in the event of a 
revision of our sales of oil products, or in the event of other changes 
to emissions factors subject to a 2% cumulative threshold.
Metrics and targets in respect of climate-related 
environmental risks 
We monitor physical risk exposures, whether climate-related or 
not, water use, emissions to air and water, biodiversity, and waste 
generated from our operations. Where relevant, we may manage 
our environmental performance by establishing specific targets. 
See 'Respecting nature' on page 111 for more information.
See "Respecting nature" on pages 109-113.
Targets used by Shell to manage climate-related risks 
and opportunities and performance against targets 
Our response to the energy transition risk focuses on decarbonising our 
value chain. This section sets out our climate targets which are focused 
on reducing our NCI and our absolute emissions, as presented on 
pages 102-103. Shell's material climate-related risks and opportunities 
are set out in the "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by 
Shell over the short, medium and long term" section on pages 80-84. 
We have set intensity targets and absolute targets and an ambition 
over the short, medium and long term to track our performance over 
time (as summarised below). The targets are forward-looking targets 
based on management's current expectations and certain material 
assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could 
cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied herein.
We believe our total net absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 
1.7 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2).
Our net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, as well 
as from the end use of all the energy products we sell. We are seeking 
to reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production 
of oil and gas. More than 90% of the total emissions we include within 
our NCI boundary are indirect emissions associated with third-party 
products and end-use emissions of energy products we sell, so we 
are also working with our customers to support them in transitioning 
to low-carbon products and services. 
In October 2021, in support of our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we 
set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets 
and activities under our operational control (including divestments) by 
50% by 2030 compared with the 2016 baseline, on a net basis. 
We aim to maintain methane emissions intensity for operated oil and 
gas assets below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 
2030. We were aiming to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream-
operated assets by 2025 [A] and Shell has delivered this target
. 
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased 
routine flaring. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed 
the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.

---- Page 104 ----
In March 2024, we set revised targets to reduce the NCI of the energy 
products we sell in 2024 by 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030 and 
100% by 2050. In recognition of the uncertainty in the pace of change 
in the energy transition, we retired our 2035 target of a 45% reduction 
in NCI.
The NCI metric measures the pace of transition by tracking our 
progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products 
sold by Shell. NCI measures emissions associated with each unit of 
energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in 
sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-
carbon products -- such as biofuels and renewable electricity. Unlike 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the NCI of the products we sell 
requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support 
of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions 
for change. 
In March 2024, we set an ambition to reduce customer emissions from 
the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) by 15-20% by 2030 
compared with 2021 [B]. This level of ambition is in line with the EU's 
climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the 
world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, 
such as gasoline and diesel, as we support customers as they move to 
electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels.
[B] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 
million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e 
in 2021. 
In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions 
that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
methane emissions and flaring. We have also set climate targets and 
an ambition for emissions that are outside our control. These include 
our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions 
from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net 
carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell.
Setting targets for NCI 
Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 
2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce 
the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, measured using 
our NCI metric. We believe these targets are aligned with the more 
ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in 
global average temperature this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's 
decarbonisation targets within the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris 
Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our NCI target using 
1.5°C scenarios developed for the IPCC's AR6.
We start with the complete set of 1.5°C scenarios and then exclude 
scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy 
before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for 
each scenario which is comparable to our own NCI. Finally, we 
produce a 1.5°C pathway based on the reductions in emissions 
intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any 
individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the 
energy transition. 
We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates 
that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris 
Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below. We also believe that 
the pace of change will vary around the world by region and by sector, 
taking into consideration the time needed for energy users to invest in 
large-scale equipment and the energy infrastructure changes needed 
for Shell to deliver more low- and zero-carbon energy.
Shell's Paris-aligned targets
Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2 target
The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 
1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve 
our target in 2030. The actions we take to achieve our target will 
depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued 
development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. We 
expect that, on a net portfolio basis, reductions predominantly from 
abatement projects including carbon capture and storage and 
electrification, may outweigh increases in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
from new investments between 2025 and 2030. Our investments in 
producing low-carbon energy will increase our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions, while reducing the NCI of the products we sell. Subsequent 
reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined 
below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target by 2030. 
To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:
￮ making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in 
low-carbon intensity projects, decommissioning plants, divesting 
assets, while sustaining our oil production with increasingly lower 
carbon intensity;
￮ progressing the repurposing of our energy and chemicals parks;
￮ improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
￮ developing CCS for some of our facilities.
If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset 
any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon 
mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.

Progress towards our NCI target
Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the NCI of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of 
governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. The biggest driver for reducing our NCI is increasing the sales of and 
demand for low-carbon energy. The chart below illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in NCI 
reductions towards 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new 
technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition.
Working to reduce our NCI

Linking Shell's emissions targets to remuneration 
We have established remuneration structures to support us in reducing 
our operational emissions and to support customers in reducing their 
emissions. The majority of employees participate in the annual bonus 
scheme which is linked to the Group scorecard. From 2025, the Long-
Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is referred to as the Performance Share 
Awards (PSA) and no further Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards will 
be made. Our annual bonus scorecard and PSA include "Shell's journey 
in the energy transition" performance metrics, which are designed to 
ensure that remuneration is aligned with Shell's Operating Plan and 
longer-term strategic ambitions. 
PSA will be awarded to Executive Directors and around 120 senior 
executives. Circa 12,000 employees will receive PSA and/or Restricted 
Share Awards (RSA), which are time-based, based on seniority.
See "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 188-190.
Energy transition performance condition and the vesting 
of the 2022 LTIP and PSP awards
The following performance outcomes for the energy transition 
performance condition were considered in the vesting assessment of 
the 2022 LTIP and PSP awards, covering the performance cycle 
2022-2024:
 
2022 LTIP energy transition performance condition: 
outcome
Outcome
Net carbon intensity (NCI) Performance indicator met
Growing the power business Performance indicator met
Growing new lower-carbon product offerings Performance indicator 
partially met
Develop emissions sinks Performance indicator 
partially met
In addition to the above, a number of broader indicators of Shell's 
progress in the energy transition were considered. Overall, it was 
determined that the energy transition measure (accounting for 20% of 
the LTIP award and 10% of the PSP award) should vest at 130% of the 
target. See "Long-term Incentive Plan vesting: 2022 LTIP - 2022 LTIP 
energy transition performance conditions outcome" on pages 197-199 
for more information. 
See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on pages 191-207.
Energy transition performance condition in the 2024 LTIP 
and PSP awards
For LTIP and PSP awards granted in 2024, the energy transition 
performance condition had a weighting of 25% in the LTIP and 12.5% 
in the PSP. Determination of the extent to which awards will vest will be 
based on its holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions 
from our operations and supporting customers to reduce their emissions. 
Energy transition performance condition for 2025 PSA 
For the 2025 PSA, the "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
performance condition retains the same weighting and performance 
assessment framework as for 2024. The determination of the extent 
to which awards will vest will be based on an holistic assessment 
of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and 
supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be 
based on climate-related targets for our own operations of:
￮halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control 
on a net basis (2016 baseline); 
￮ eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and 
￮ maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving 
near-zero methane emissions by 2030 [B]. 
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased 
routine flaring. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed 
the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[B] On an intensity basis.
It will also take into account progress in developments that support the 
energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our 
Power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, 
electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and CCS.
Additionally, progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 
2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from 
the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [C], as well as Shell's 
wider performance in helping to accelerate the energy transition, such as 
by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard-setting, alongside 
any other factors considered material will be taken into account.
[C] This ambition was set in March 2024. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products 
(Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes 
CO2e in 2021.
See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on page 206 for more information on the 
proposed performance framework.
Energy transition targets in the annual bonus scorecard 
Delivering on our net-zero emissions target is a part of the annual bonus 
scorecard, which helps determine annual performance bonus outcomes 
for senior management and the majority of Shell's employees. 
The energy transition progress measures are shown in the table below.

Our score for LNG volumes in 2024 was above target, reflecting 
strong operational performance. This was driven mainly by volume 
increases in Australia and the Atlantic region, partly offset by feedgas 
constraints in Nigeria and Egypt.
The 2024 outcome for operational emissions reductions was 
outstanding with 1,028 thousand tonnes of GHG emissions reductions 
from abatement, renewable energy and permanent shutdowns or 
conversions ("right-sizing"). This was driven by catalyst improvements in 
Pearl, Forcados Yokri Gas Project in Nigeria and optimisation of 
liquefaction control system in QGC.
We have continued to grow our network of electric vehicle charge 
points, exceeding our 2024 target. In 2024, we added around 19,000 
charge points, which brings the total number to around 73,000.
There is no change to the energy transition measure in our annual 
bonus scorecard for 2025.

Assurance of GHG emissions measures
Independent assurance report to the directors of Shell plc 
on Greenhouse Gas Emissions
We have been engaged by Shell plc ("Shell") to perform a 'limited 
assurance engagement', as defined by International Standards on 
Assurance Engagements, here after referred to as the engagement, 
to report on the accompanying GHG statement to be included within 
the "Our Journey to Net Zero" section within Shell's Annual Report & 
Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 (the "Report"), 
comprising of the following, hereafter the "Subject Matter". All 
Subject Matter relates to the year ended 31 December 2024 
unless stated otherwise.

￮ Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Operational Control 
Boundary)
Net Carbon Intensity related KPI's ("NCI Subject Matter")
￮Net Carbon Intensity
￮ Scope 3, Categories 1, 3, 9, 11 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Equity

￮ Revised Scope 3, Categories 1, 3, 9, 11 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
(Equity Boundary) for the years ended 31 December 2016, 31 
December 2020 through 31 December 2023 (inclusive)
Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the 
scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures 
on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, 
we do not express a conclusion on this information.
Comparative information included in the Report has not been part of 
our limited assurance engagement other than KPI's set out within the 
Subject Matter. Consequently, we do not provide any assurance on the 
comparative information and thereto related disclosures in the Report. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Criteria applied by Shell
In preparing the GHG Subject Matter, Shell applied its internal 
performance monitoring and reporting requirements that incorporates 
ISO 14064-01 (2018) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (the 
"GHG Criteria"). 
In preparing the NCI Subject Matter, Shell applied the Shell Net 
Carbon Footprint: Methodology (the "NCI Criteria"). The NCI Criteria 
can be accessed on shell.com.
GHG and NCI Criteria were designed for the preparation of the 
Report. As a result, the Subject Matter information may not be suitable 
for another purpose. 
Shell's responsibilities
Shell's management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and 
for presenting the Subject Matter in accordance with that Criteria,
in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and 
maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and 
making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the GHG 
statement, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.
EY's responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation
of the Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained. 
Our engagement was conducted in accordance with the International 
Standard for Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements 
('ISAE 3410') and the International Standard for Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ("ISAE 
3000 (Revised)"), and the terms of reference for this engagement as 
agreed with Shell on August 8, 2024.Those standards require that we 
plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether 
we are aware of any material modifications that need to be made to 
the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria, 
and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures 
selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk 
of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.
Our independence and quality management
We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met 
the requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants 
and have the required competencies and experience to conduct this 
assurance review.
EY also applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, 
Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of 
Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services 
engagements, which requires that we design, implement and operate 
a system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Description of procedures performed
Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in 
nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained 
in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain 
a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not 
provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a 
reasonable level of assurance.

105 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 108 ----
Although we considered the effectiveness of management's internal 
controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, 
our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance 
on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or 
performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation 
of data within IT systems. The Greenhouse Gas quantification process 
is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete 
scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs. Additionally, 
GHG procedures are subject to estimation (or measurement) 
uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation 
processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of 
existing scientific knowledge.
A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily 
of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matter and related 
information, and applying analytical and other relevant procedures. 
Our procedures included:
￮Making inquiries of the specialists responsible for managing the 
Subject Matter to obtain an understanding of the relevant reporting 
processes and control framework
￮ Obtaining an understanding of the Subject Matter and Criteria and 
considering the reasonableness of the methodology and associated 
assumptions
￮ Re-performing the underlying calculations applied in the Subject 
Matter
￮ Performing analytical review procedures over the Subject Matter
￮ Examining the disclosures within the Report for the appropriate 
presentation of the Subject Matter, including the discussion of 
limitations and assumptions relating to the data presented 
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary 
in the circumstances.
Conclusion
Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, we are not 
aware of any material modifications that should be made to the 
Subject Matter for the year ended 31 December 2024, in order
for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.
Restricted use
We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this 
assurance report or its conclusions to any other persons, or for any 
purpose other than that for which it was prepared. Accordingly, we 
accept no liability whatsoever, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, 
to any third party for any consequences of the use or misuse of this 
assurance report or its conclusions.

Energy use in our operations 
The energy consumption data provided below comprises own energy, 
generated and consumed by our facilities, and energy purchased 
(electricity, steam and heat) by our facilities for our use. 
Energy consumption data reflects primary (thermal) energy (including 
the energy content of fuels used to generate electricity, steam, heat, 
mechanical energy). This includes energy from renewable and
non-renewable sources. 
Own energy generated is calculated by multiplying the volumes of fuels 
consumed for energy purposes by their respective lower heating values. 
Own energy generated that is exported to third-party assets or to the 
power grid is excluded. 
Thermal energy for purchased and consumed electricity is calculated 
using actual electricity purchased multiplied by country-specific 
electricity generation efficiency factors (from IEA statistics). 
Thermal energy for purchased and consumed steam or heat is 
calculated from actual steam or heat purchased multiplied by a 
supplier-specific conversion efficiency, or a generic efficiency factor 
where supplier-specific data are not available.

Our energy consumption increased from 205 billion kilowatt-hours 
(kWh) in 2023 to 212 billion kWh in 2024, in line with the increase 
in our Scope 2 GHG emissions. Around 1% of the energy we used

In 2024, we implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy 
use and increase the energy efficiency of our operations.
Examples of some of the principal measures taken in 2024 to reduce 
energy use and improve efficiency (with estimated total savings of 
around 1,233 million kWh in 2024) are:
￮At our Rheinland site in Germany: replacement of liquid fuel fired 
boilers with gas fired boilers.
￮ At our QGC site in Australia: implementation of advanced process 
control for liquefaction at the QGC Midstream LNG facility and a 
reduction in required hydraulic power motor speed at well sites. 
￮ At our Prelude site in Australia: optimisation of process resulting in 
reduced steam consumption and flaring and reduced fuel gas use.
￮ At our GTL asset in Qatar: reduction of minimum flow of fuel gas to 
the cogeneration system, allowing fuel gas to be used in other 
furnaces replacing natural gas usage.
￮ At our Sarawak Shell Berhad assets in Malaysia: upgrading a gas 
turbine air intake filter to a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) 
filter. 
￮ At our upstream operations in the UK: flare optimisation, which 
resulted in less fuel gas that needed to be mixed with flare gas to 
make it combustible. 
￮ At our Gulf of America Mars site: savings of fuel gas combustion as 
a result of operating the gas compression system with only one field 
gas compressor.
￮ At our Gulf of America Perdido site: reduction of the electrical power 
demand through reduction of production separation pressure.
Examples of some of the principal measures that were taken in 2023 
are listed below (with estimated total savings of around 999 million 
kWh in 2023):
￮At our Geismar site in the USA: idling the furnace when not required.
￮ At our Rheinland site in Germany: optimising the amount of steam 
required depending on use and load. 
￮ At our Sarnia site in Canada: replacing an existing reaction furnace 
with a new high-intensity burner.
￮ At our Scotford complex in Canada: optimisation which enables a 
reduction in electricity and excess hydrogen vented to flare.
￮ At our Prelude site in Australia: optimisation of the process and 
operating conditions to reduce flaring.
￮ At our Pearl site in Qatar: reducing steam generation requirements 
via steam balance optimisation.
￮ At our GTL asset in Malaysia: optimising fuel flows to the boiler unit.
￮ At our UK Upstream operations: reducing compression power 
requirements between our Shearwater platform and St Fergus gas 
terminal.
￮ At our Gulf of America operations in the USA: optimising power 
generation between platform and rig and upgrading existing 
equipment.
￮ At our Sarawak Shell Berhad assets in Malaysia: optimising the use 
of gas turbine generators from four to three units.
EU Taxonomy Regulation
The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system for determining 
when an economic activity can be considered environmentally 
sustainable according to EU standards. It aims to encourage investment 
in a low-carbon economy by creating common definitions of 
sustainability and mandatory disclosures to help investors make 
informed decisions. In anticipation of the transposition by the 
Netherlands of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) into national law, a key development for Shell in 2024 has 
been the voluntary implementation of the CSRD and the accompanying 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). This means Shell 
plc will come fully into scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation upon the 
transposition of the CSRD by the Netherlands into law. The CSRD 
extends the EU Taxonomy Regulation's reporting obligation to third-
country issuers that are listed on European exchanges. 
See "EU Taxonomy disclosure" on pages 377-390.

and through changes to the use of land and water. 
In 2024, we have:
￮ continued to embed our respect for nature into our activities, 
standards and business processes;
￮ expanded our data reporting capabilities to help meet regulatory 
requirements;
￮ continued to build employees' awareness, knowledge and skills 
to deepen their understanding of respecting nature; and
￮ continued to meet our commitments to reduce fresh-water 
consumption in water-stressed areas and to use packaging for 
our products that is designed to be reusable or recyclable.
Our approach is underpinned by the Shell Commitment and Policy on 
Health, Security, Safety, the Environment and Social Performance (HSSE 
& SP), and our Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) 
Standards, which are part of the Shell Performance Framework.
We require our operated assets to be certified to an independent and 
internationally recognised standard for environmental management 
systems, such as ISO 14001 or equivalent, if they have significant 
environmental risks.
We report data in this section on a 100% basis for companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless stated otherwise.
See "Our approach to sustainability" on page 130.  
Biodiversity and ecosystems
We aim to manage the impact of our activities on the environment 
and to make a positive contribution to biodiversity in our operations.
￮Forest habitats: We are replanting forests and working to achieve 
net-zero deforestation from new activities while maintaining 
biodiversity and conservation value.
￮ Critical habitats: Our new projects in areas rich in biodiversity, 
known as critical habitats, are designed to achieve a net positive 
impact on biodiversity.
￮ World Heritage Sites: Since 2003, we do not explore for, or 
develop, oil and gas resources in natural and mixed World 
Heritage Sites.
When planning a project, our standards require us to assess the 
potential impact of projects on biodiversity and communities as part 
of our impact assessment process. We then apply the mitigation 
hierarchy, a decision-making framework that involves a sequence 
of four key actions: avoid, minimise, restore and offset. 
Achieving a positive impact on biodiversity can take many years because 
complex ecosystems need time to develop after conservation efforts. 
We believe it is important to involve communities in conservation 
projects, so we often work in collaboration with local organisations.

Forest habitats
Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses. 
We apply the definition of forest used by the UN's Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our commitment to net-zero 
deforestation commenced in 2022.
Our aim is to avoid deforestation, in line with the mitigation hierarchy. 
Where avoidance is not achievable, we require our assets, projects 
and businesses to develop and implement reforestation plans. These 
plans include measures designed to achieve net-zero deforestation, 
while maintaining biodiversity and conservation value. We work with 
partners and stakeholders to develop robust and credible plans unique 
to each reforestation project.
There is typically a time lag between the deforestation of an area and 
the start of the replanting process, which can range from months to 
years. As a result, there is often a difference in the number of hectares 
deforested and the number of hectares replanted within a single year.
In 2024, around 214 hectares were deforested as a result of our 
activities. This occurred largely in Australia, Canada and Nigeria 
where we are preparing for or implementing reforestation programmes 
in line with local plans. We reforested 64 hectares in 2024 in Canada.
Critical habitats
Critical habitats are specific areas of high biodiversity value in which 
receptors are particularly sensitive to development. 
When undertaking a project in a critical habitat, we aim to go beyond 
compensating for a residual adverse impact to deliver an overall 
conservation gain to or net positive impact on biodiversity. 
If a project is located in a critical habitat, we develop and implement a 
biodiversity action plan. This sets out the actions needed to follow the 
mitigation hierarchy and includes measures to achieve a net positive 
impact on biodiversity. 
At the end of 2024, 62 new projects for which the final investment 
decision had been taken after February 2021 were located in critical 
habitats. Of these, 61 have a biodiversity action plan in place to work 
towards a net positive impact.

Examples of activities in development or under way in 2024 include:
￮ in partnership with a local university, we are executing an ecological 
restoration programme on Browse Island, Australia, to help eradicate 
invasive alien species, improve reef health and promote the return of 
breeding seabirds to enhance regional resilience; 
￮ on Príncipe Island, São Tomé and Príncipe, we helped implement a 
turtle conservation programme in partnership with a local 
conservation organisation; and 
￮ in partnership with the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology 
for Scotland (MASTS), and its member institutions, including Scottish 
government stakeholders, we helped to set up a multi-year research 
programme to gain insights into the ecology of skates and sharks in 
Scottish waters to help develop effective conservation strategies.

Resource use and circular economy
We aim to use water and other resources efficiently, and to increase 
our reuse and recycling. 
￮Waste and circularity: Our businesses are deepening their efforts 
to better understand the types of waste we generate and identify 
options to increase circular approaches.
￮ Water: We are implementing water stewardship principles across 
our businesses and developing water stewardship management 
plans. This includes focusing on the sustainable management of 
fresh water resources, particularly in water-stressed areas.
￮ Packaging: We have a priority to increase the amount of recycled 
plastic in Shell-branded packaging to 30% by 2030, based on the 
reference year of 2022, and to ensure that the packaging we use 
for our products is reusable or recyclable by design. These priorities 
apply to Shell-branded Mobility and Lubricants products.
Waste and circularity
In 2024, we introduced a new requirement within our SEAM Standards 
for our assets, projects or businesses to develop strategies to identify 
circularity-related risks and opportunities. Through this, we aim to 
encourage the development of fit-for-purpose objectives and strategies 
based on the principles of rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle 
and repair.
Since 2021, we have completed 26 detailed assessments across our 
businesses to better understand the types of waste we generate and 
identify options to increase circular approaches. Using these results, 
our assets are improving local waste management practices by 
prioritising waste prevention, reuse and recycling over energy 
recovery and disposal.
Key developments related to waste and circularity in 2024 include:
￮at the Pearl gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar, we have diverted waste 
to local cement kilns for use as clinker in cement production, thereby 
reducing use of raw materials and the amount of waste sent to landfill;
￮ our Gulf of America operations are finding ways to reduce disposal 
of unused chemicals, for example, by testing and treating them so 
that they can be returned to the supplier for reuse; and
￮ at our Brazos wind farm upgrade in Texas, we sent decommissioned 
turbine blades to be recycled for use as a component in construction 
materials.
We are working to reduce waste and increase circularity in those parts 
of our business where it is possible to do so. In 2024, we concluded our 
aim for zero waste is technically unfeasible. We continue to improve 
waste and circularity plans at the asset level to drive fit-for-purpose 
waste reduction and optimise local circular economies.
In 2024, we disposed of 1,933 thousand tonnes of waste, compared 
with 2,251 thousand tonnes in 2023. 
Water
We require our assets, projects or businesses to manage sourcing, 
use, treatment and disposal of water based on recognised water 
stewardship principles and to implement this through a water 
stewardship management plan. These plans help us to move away 
from a traditional inside-out approach focusing on our impact on the 
environment to an outside-in approach that considers how we impact, 
and are impacted by, the environment. They also help us to reduce 
consumption in water-stressed areas.
Since 2021, we have conducted water stewardship assessments at 
18 assets across different businesses and regions, with a priority on 
operations in areas of high water stress and those that use significant 
quantities of fresh water. The insights gained from these assessments 
have moved us towards a more holistic stewardship approach. This 
goes beyond only focusing on water use to also considering factors 
such as water footprint, regional water stress, water quality, 
catchments, governance and stakeholder engagement. Building on 
these efforts, our Mobility and US Midstream businesses developed 
water stewardship plans in 2024. 
In 2021, we set a voluntary commitment to reduce our consumption 
of fresh water by 15% by 2025 compared with 2018 levels in areas 
where there is high fresh-water stress. We achieved this commitment 
ahead of time in 2022. In 2024, our consumption of fresh water in 
areas of high water stress was 16 million cubic metres compared with 
25 million cubic metres in the base year of 2018, a 36% reduction over 
the period. 
Discharges to water
We track pollutants in water returned to the environment from the day-
to-day running of our facilities (referred to as "discharges to surface 
water"). We work to minimise these discharges according to local 
regulatory requirements and our SEAM Standards. 
Plastics
Shell supports the need for improved circularity of the global plastics 
market. We encourage reduction, reuse and recycling of plastics and 
are a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which 
helps governments to assess and improve waste collection and waste 
management. We are working with partners across the plastic waste 
value chain, such as the waste management industry and pyrolysis 
oil producers, to encourage the development of a more circular 
value chain.

---- Page 114 ----
Since 2019, Shell has been processing pyrolysis oil made from mixed 
plastic waste at the Shell Norco Energy and Chemicals Park in the 
USA. In 2024, we began production at our new pyrolysis oil upgrader 
at the Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk in the Netherlands. The upgrader 
improves the quality of pyrolysis oil, a liquid made from hard-to-recycle 
plastic waste, and turns it into chemical feedstock. The plant has the 
capacity to process up to 50,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil per year. 
Packaging
Shell has a priority to increase the amount of recycled plastic in Shell-
branded packaging to 30% by 2030 based on the reference year 
of 2022 and to use packaging for our products that is reusable or 
recyclable by design. These priorities apply to Shell-branded Mobility 
and Lubricants products. 
￮Packaging classified as reusable or recyclable: In 2024, we 
continued to meet our priority to use packaging for our products that 
is reusable or recyclable by design. We maintained 99% total Shell-
branded product packaging classified as reusable or recyclable in 
our Lubricants business and achieved 92% in our Mobility business, 
compared with 79% in the base year of 2022.
￮ Recycled plastic content in packaging: By the end of 2024, we had 
achieved a level of 17% recycled plastic content by weight in Shell-
branded plastic packaging compared with 10% in the base year 
of 2022. 
Air quality
We follow the most stringent of either the SEAM Standards or local 
regulations to manage airborne pollutants in our operations, including 
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs).
There are often synergies to be achieved between greenhouse 
gas improvement opportunities and reducing emissions of other 
air pollutants. For example, operational efficiencies that reduce 
site power generation can also reduce emissions of VOCs, SOx and 
NOx. In 2024, we continued to implement leak detection and repair 
programmes to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds,
with a focus on sources exceeding 100 tonnes per year.
We are developing a range of choices for customers to help 
people and companies reduce their transport emissions. This includes 
building our electric vehicle charging business. For heavy-duty road 
transport, LNG as a fuel and GTL fuel and motor oils help reduce 
sulphur emissions, particulates and nitrogen oxide compared with
oil-based products.
Our key metrics in 2024 include:
￮ SOx emissions in 2024 decreased to 21 thousand tonnes, compared 
with 31 thousand tonnes in 2023. 
￮ NOx emissions in 2024 increased to 92 thousand tonnes compared 
with 88 thousand tonnes in 2023. 
￮ VOC emissions in 2024 were 32 thousand tonnes compared with 
32 thousand tonnes in 2023 (restated from 36 thousand tonnes 
following a review of the performance data).
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 76.
Spills
Our assets are designed to avoid discharges to soil or groundwater. 
However, spills can occur due to operational failure, accidents, unusual 
corrosion, or theft and sabotage. Large spills of crude oil, oil products 
and chemicals can harm the environment. They can also result in major 
clean-up costs, fines and other damages. Spills can affect our licence 
to operate and harm our reputation.
Spill prevention and response
Our policies on asset integrity and process safety are in place to 
prevent losses of containment from happening. We design, operate 
and maintain our facilities with the intention of preventing spills, by 
identifying potential hazards and implementing controls that can 
prevent them from occurring. This is integral to our Goal Zero ambition 
of doing no harm to people and to have no leaks across our 
operations. If a spill or a leak occurs, we use barriers that operate 
independently of each other to reduce the likelihood of a release 
becoming catastrophic. Such barriers are designed so that, if the failure 
of one occurs, it does not lead to the failure of others. Our policies on 
soil and groundwater are designed to manage the potential health 
and environmental impacts should spills occur. 
Our business units are responsible for organising and executing spill 
responses in line with the SEAM Standards and relevant legal and 
regulatory requirements. Our assets have spill response plans, based 
on worst-case spill scenarios, should an incident occur. We also 
continue to be involved in industry groups to improve well-containment 
capabilities. These include the Marine Well Containment Company in 
the Gulf of America and Oil Spill Response Limited, a global industry 
group. For oil spills, we have a global response network that enables 
us to deal more effectively with oil spills, supplementing local 
response capability.
See "Safety" on page 123. 
In 2024, there were 69 operational spills of more than 100 kilograms 
compared with 71 in 2023 (restated from 70 operational spills of more 
than 100 kilograms following a review of the performance data). The 
volume of operational spills of oil and oil products in 2024 was 1.23 
thousand tonnes, compared with 0.37 thousand tonnes in 2023. The 
increase in operational spill volumes is partly attributable to a spill that 
occurred during severe weather in the Gulf of America, as well as 
incidents in Singapore, Canada and Nigeria.
Spills in Nigeria
SPDC JV - Nigeria: operational spills
In 2024, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
Limited (SPDC) [A], as operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV, 
Shell interest 30%), reported 20 operational spill incidents of more 
than 100 kilograms of crude oil, compared with 9 reported in 2023. 
The increase in the number of operational spill incidents was largely 
because of a rise in cases of failure due to factory defects in a locally 
manufactured clamp used in pipeline repairs following the removal of 
illegal connections. The company that manufactured the clamps has 
recalled the affected batch, and SPDC has commenced the 
replacement of the clamps. 
In 2024, the volume of operational spills of oil and oil products was 
0.37 thousand tonnes compared with 0.005 thousand tonnes reported 
in 2023. The majority (89%) of the 2024 volume relates to two 
significant incidents, one onshore on the Trans Niger Pipeline and the 
other offshore at a terminal loading buoy.
[A] Unless otherwise stated, all activities reported for or as relating to The Shell Petroleum 
Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in this section should be understood as 
SPDC acting as the operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV). SPDC, as the corporate 
entity, owns 30% of the joint venture.
Strategic Report | Performance in the year | Respecting nature continued
112 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 115 ----
SPDC JV has an ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain and 
replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines to reduce the number 
of operational spills.
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance. 
By preserving the full range of SPDC's operating capabilities, the 
transaction has been designed to ensure that the company can 
continue to perform its role as operator and to meet its share of 
commitments within the joint venture, including those relating to 
health, safety, security and environment. 
See "Upstream" on page 43.
SPDC JV - Nigeria: spills caused by crude theft and 
sabotage
In 2024, about 81% of crude oil spill incidents of more than 100 
kilograms from SPDC JV facilities were caused by the illegal activities 
of third parties. In 2024, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 
100 kilograms caused by crude theft and sabotage was 2.0 thousand 
tonnes (84 incidents), compared with 1.4 thousand tonnes (139 
incidents) in 2023. The decrease in the number of incidents in 2024 
shows an increased effectiveness of anti-theft protection mechanisms. 
Prevention
In 2024, SPDC JV continued on-ground surveillance of its areas 
of operation, including its pipeline network, to mitigate third-party 
interference and ensure that spills are detected and responded
to as quickly as possible.
Regular surveillance flights and drones are used to inspect the most 
vulnerable segments of the pipeline network, monitor security and 
identify any new spills or illegal activity. SPDC JV continued to install 
and improve anti-theft protection mechanisms for key infrastructure, 
such as wellheads and manifolds. These include protective measures 
such as cages, anti-theft nuts and improved CCTV and networking 
capabilities. These measures continue to help deter theft and 
improve response.
SPDC JV continued to work with the government security agencies in 
2024 to maintain surveillance and address illegal activities of third 
parties, primarily along the SPDC JV pipelines and their 
operational areas.
Response and remediation
Regardless of the cause, SPDC JV cleans up and remediates areas 
affected by spills originating from its facilities. Clean-up activities 
include bio-remediation which stimulates micro-organisms that naturally 
break down and use carbon-rich oil, effectively removing it. Once 
clean-up and soil remediation operations are completed, the work is 
inspected and, if satisfactory, approved and certified by the Nigerian 
regulators. In the event of operational spills, SPDC JV also pays 
compensation to affected people and communities.
SPDC JV works with a range of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to 
monitor biodiversity recovery at remediated sites and to build greater 
trust in spill response and clean-up processes. 
The clean-up programme established following the 2011 United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report on Ogoniland is 
executed by the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), 
an agency of the Nigerian government. Completion of remediation 
under this programme is verified and certified by the National Oil Spill 
Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA). HYPREP has reported 
progress of the execution of its programme during 2024 with clean-up 
efforts for 18 sites continuing, and remediation plans being developed 
for the remaining 15 sites. SPDC has fully funded its share of the 
HYPREP programme.
In 2015, SPDC JV and the Bodo community in Ogoniland signed a 
memorandum of understanding, granting the remediation team access 
to begin cleaning up areas affected by two operational spills that 
occurred in 2008. Phase 1 of an agreed three-phase clean-up and 
remediation programme, which involved removal of oil from shoreline 
surfaces and mud flatbeds, was completed in 2018. In 2024, SPDC JV 
remediated soil and sediments in an additional 106 hectares, bringing 
Phase 2 to 99% completion. SPDC JV also planted about 1.7 million 
mangrove seedlings in 2024 as part of Phase 3, achieving 85% of the 
project's revegetation goal, up from 17% in 2023. SPDC JV is seeking 
certification of remediated areas from NOSDRA. 
SPDC JV continues to raise awareness of and counter the negative 
effects of crude oil theft and illegal oil refining.

Shell strives to make a positive impact on people around the 
world and this includes providing the energy people need, 
contributing to local economies and communities, championing 
inclusion and respecting human rights.
We help ensure energy security in our key markets and invest in 
businesses that supply energy access in emerging markets. Through our 
social investments, we also provide funds, expertise and resources to 
increase energy access outside of our commercial business. The supply 
of affordable and secure energy is crucial for addressing global 
challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. 
Our activities contribute to economies and communities around 
the world through job creation, spending on goods and services, and 
through the payment of taxes and royalties to governments. Across 
more than 70 countries, we employ thousands of people and provide 
them with opportunities to develop their careers.
As we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business, we work 
with governments and society to support positive economic and social 
impacts of the transition on our workforce, communities, suppliers 
and customers. 
Our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people underpin 
everything we do. We aim to become one of the world's most diverse 
and inclusive organisations, a place where everyone feels valued, 
respected and has a strong sense of belonging. 
The importance of respecting people also extends to our suppliers. 
Shell's Supplier Principles outline our expectations for business integrity, 
health, safety, security, labour and human rights, and environmental 
and social performance.
Many of our operations are located close to communities and we aim 
to be a good neighbour. This includes strong community engagement, 
managing the negative social impacts of our operations and delivering 
a range of benefits through jobs, local business opportunities and 
social investment programmes. This engagement enables us to identify 
and manage impacts from our activities and provide access to remedy.
Our people
Our people are essential to our purpose of powering progress 
together. They are key to delivering our strategy and we believe in 
helping them to develop their skills.
All metrics throughout this section exclude employees in portfolio 
companies [A], except for the metrics reflecting total employee 
number by gender and region, percentage of women employees, 
and certain mandatory training courses.
[A] Portfolio companies are non-integrated entities within the Shell Group. To give these 
companies the flexibility they need, they operate as subsidiaries while generally retaining 
their own processes and systems. Portfolio companies comply with Shell's minimum 
requirements for controls and compliance. This includes the Shell Performance Framework 
and mandatory requirements for ethics and compliance, risk management and safety.

Employee overview 
We employed 96,000 people on a full- or part-time basis as of 
December 31, 2024. This compares with 103,000 at the end of 
2023 and 93,000 at the end of 2022. 
The reduced number of employees in 2024 compared with 2023 
reflects our focus on performance, discipline and simplification as 
we implement our strategy. We improved efficiencies, and divested 
and ended some activities in our Downstream, Renewables and 
Energy Solutions business. We also improved efficiencies in our 
Projects & Technology, Human Resources, Legal and Corporate 
Relations functions.
Employee overview figures include people working for Shell companies 
and Shell-operated joint ventures, as well as those seconded to non-
operated joint ventures, but exclude contingent workers, otherwise 
referred to as contractors. Contractors are external workers who are 
engaged directly or through third parties to provide services to Shell. 
They work alongside Shell employees in divisions such as Information 
and Digital Technology.
Changes in headcount
We employed 81,000 people in Shell, excluding portfolio companies, 
at the end of December 2024. This is fewer than the 84,000 at the end 
of 2023. Shell's portfolio companies, which generally maintain their 
own HR systems, employed 15,000 at the end of 2024 compared 
with 19,000 at the end of 2023.

Shell aims to be an attractive employer to its existing and prospective 
employees. We offer employees the opportunity to develop their 
careers within Shell, including rotations across different parts of 
the business to grow their skills and progress. 
People development remains a priority for our organisation. We 
proactively identify skill and capability gaps for traditional and 
emerging businesses; offer training to address these gaps; and if 
needed recruit talent externally to add to the skills and experiences of 
our workforce. To enable our leaders to lead this change, we support 
them through targeted interventions including leadership development 
and coaching. Our mindset and behaviours, which emphasise 
psychological safety, are at the heart of our leadership programmes. 
Training courses are accessible to all employees, either online or in 
person. In 2024, 264,000 formal training days were delivered to 
employees and joint-venture partners. This compares with 295,000 
training days in 2023 and reflects staff reductions in 2024.
Shell's employee turnover as of December 31, 2024 was 7.6%; 6,227 
employees left Shell of which 2,931 resigned voluntarily. This compares 
with 5.7% in 2023, during which 4,685 employees left Shell of which 
2,669 voluntarily.

Employee engagement 
Insight into employee needs and perspectives enables Shell to 
continually learn and improve our policies, processes and practices. 
Management regularly engages with employees through elected 
employee representatives and a range of local formal and informal 
channels. These channels include webcasts and all-employee messages 
from our CEO and other senior leaders, as well as town halls, team 
meetings and site visits by the Board and EC. 
In 2024, members of the Board and EC visited Shell sites in the 
Netherlands where they engaged with employees on our strategy 
and the energy transition. Board members and Chair, Sir Andrew 
Mackenzie, also met with employees in Qatar, Oman and Brazil.
See "Workforce engagement" on pages 167-168. 
We seek to comply with applicable local laws and regulations, 
including those on working hours. Shell is committed to respecting 
human rights. This includes, but is not limited to, the elimination of 
forced and child labour, respect for freedom of association and the 
effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Where 
appropriate, engagements take place with union and employee 
representatives at asset and country level, as well as with the Shell 
European Works Council. Employees have access to senior leaders, 
local employee forums and employee resource groups. We believe 
these engagements enable Shell to maintain a constructive employee 
and industrial relations environment.

the Netherlands.
The Shell People Survey
The Shell People Survey is one of the key tools we use to measure 
employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to 
Shell. External and internal research shows that increased employee 
engagement can result in better business performance and improved 
safety. In 2024, the response rate to the survey was 86%, compared 
with 88% in 2023 which indicates our people's desire to provide 
feedback. The overall employee engagement score decreased to 75 
(compared with the top quartile 80 points) from 79 points in 2023, 
which we believe reflects the level of changes introduced in the 
organisation as we transform our business to deliver more value 
with less emissions.
Pay, benefits and well-being
Our Fair Pay Principles are designed to manage pay at Shell and help 
us ensure that employees are valued, respected and recognised for the 
work they do. Shell's pay is designed to be market competitive and free 
from bias. The basis for paying fairly is equal pay for equal work, taking 
into account factors such as performance and experience. Through 
regular benchmarking, Shell's compensation is typically higher than the 
minimum wage level observed locally, including in countries without 
legislation on minimum wage. Pay adjustment at Shell is linked to 
performance and we share this information with employees to help 
them understand how their pay adjustments are made. We continue 
to engage employees transparently and openly about our pay policies 
to help build understanding, trust and confidence in our approach.
Shell provides a range of benefits, such as global minimum standards 
for life, accident and disability cover, as well as maternity and parental 
leave, except in certain cases where we are precluded from offering 
this. Our benefit packages are tailored to each country to meet the 
requirements of local laws and regulations.
Flexible work 
We seek to build a sense of community and collaboration within 
Shell's sites where we want employees to feel welcome and valued. 
By enabling people to balance their work and personal lives, we can 
help them perform at their best. Our Future of Work guide advises 
employees and team leaders on hybrid working options. 
Employee well-being 
Our goal is to empower our employees to feel their best and perform 
at their best. We do this by promoting mindsets and behaviours that 
support good health, by protecting our people from illness by mitigating 
known risk factors. We use evidence-based tools and provide access to 
timely support and care for those who are injured, ill or struggling.
Interventions to promote mental, physical and social well-being are 
delivered via a mix of measures. For example, through the design of our 
workspaces, through local benefit offerings such as gyms and health 
checks, and through our country-based employee networks, group 
activities and events. Our global campaigns such as I'm Not OK and 
World Mental Health Day, help develop individual and team well-
being skill sets, to create healthy and psychologically safe working 
environments, and to nurture a culture of care. 
Mental well-being 
We work to reduce the stigma associated with mental ill health through 
open conversations, global and country-level campaigns, senior leader 
communications, engagements with elected employee representatives, 
and through our experience-sharing portal for employees. This 
commitment is underscored by our CEO signing a leadership pledge 
with MindForward Alliance and the launch of our Global Mental Well-
being Programme in 2023. The programme's interventions focus on 
developing a workplace culture that supports good mental health and 
offers employees the opportunity to complete an anonymous and 
voluntary survey in which they can voice their experience of well-being 
at Shell. We monitor the survey results to identify opportunities to 
improve employee well-being. In 2024, we continued to improve the 
programme, introducing new resources such as those that address 
financial well-being.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
We have ambitions around diversity, equity and inclusion and monitor 
these on a regular basis. We also continually assess our culture and 
employee engagement through tools such as the annual Shell People 
Survey.

We promote equal opportunity and aim to create an environment 
where people feel included. Our approach seeks to reinforce respect 
for people and seeks to provide psychological safety for all our 
employees.
Shell employees and contractors are required to complete training 
courses that reinforce expected behaviours for a respectful, inclusive 
workplace, and build our stance against discrimination and 
harassment, including bullying and sexual harassment. Employees 
and contractors are required to take these courses every two years.
In 2024, our Shell People Survey showed a result of 81 points out of 
100 for all questions relating to DE&I. This is a decrease of two points 
from 2023 and puts us below the top quartile (85 points). We will 
continue to focus on improving these efforts in the workplace.
As of 2024, Shell is able to provide 93% of employees where legally 
permissible with the option to voluntarily declare their gender identity, 
sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, and disability, via the HR system. 
Data from this self-identification initiative allow us to monitor progress 
against our DE&I aspirations.
Gender
We strive to achieve gender equality. We have signed the World 
Economic Forum declaration on closing the gender gap in the oil and 
gas sector and have endorsed the Catalyst CEO Champions for 
Change initiative for the advancement of women, especially those 
from ethnic minorities, into senior leadership and board positions.
In line with the UK Listing Rules, the Board of Shell plc aims for gender 
balance on the Board, with at least one senior Board position [A] held 
by a woman. To provide flexibility for periods of change, we aim to 
maintain the representation of both men and women at, or above, 
a minimum of 40%. As of December 31, 2024, women made up 
42% of the Board and the position of CFO was held by a woman. 
[A] Senior Board position means Chair, CEO, Senior Independent Director, or CFO.
Over the years, Shell has progressively increased the representation 
of women on the EC and in senior leadership roles. As of January 1, 
2024, we had 57% women and 43% men on our EC. We aim to 
achieve 35% representation of women in our senior leadership 
positions by 2025, and 40% by 2030. The table below shows 
the representation of women as of December 31, 2024.
Gender diversity at Board and management level [A]
Men Women
Level 2024 2023 2024 2023
Board  58 %  58 %  42 %  42 %
Executive Committee  43 %  57 %  57 %  43 %
Senior Leadership roles [A]  67 %  68 %  33 %  32 %
[A] Senior Leadership is a Shell measure based on compensation grade levels. This measure 
is distinct from "senior manager" as per statutory disclosure requirements set out in the 
table below. 
Gender diversity data (at December 31, 2024)
Men Women
Gender diversity data Number % Number %
Directors of the Company  7  58 %  5  42 %
Senior managers [A]  774  65 %  413  35 %
Employees (thousand)  63  65 %  33  35 %
[A] Senior manager is defined in section 414C(9) of the Companies Act 2006 and, 
accordingly, the number disclosed comprises the Executive Committee members 
who were not Directors of the Company, and other directors of Shell subsidiaries 
(excluding Directors of portfolio companies). 
As of December 31, 2024, 35% of Shell employees were women. Of 
the experienced hires who joined Shell as of December 31, 2024, 37% 
were women compared with 38% in 2023. Of the graduate hires who 
joined Shell as of December 31, 2024, 57% were women compared 
with 40% in 2023.
A crucial element of achieving gender balance is addressing any pay 
gap [A] and we continue to work towards improvements in this area. 
The basis for paying fairly is equal pay for equal work, taking into 
account factors such as performance and experience. At Shell, we 
monitor pay equity [B] through regular analysis to be confident that 
we have pay equity between genders for performing the same jobs. 
We address any unexplained pay differences related to gender 
through rigorous internal processes and apply our Fair Pay Principles. 
We continue to make progress in our gender ambitions at Shell, but 
a gender pay gap exists for several reasons, including fewer women 
in senior leadership positions and fewer women in higher-paid 
specialist roles. 
[A] Shell seeks to comply with applicable requirements and regulation on pay gap reporting.
[B] Men and women who are paid the same for doing similar jobs, at similar level, 
responsibility, tenure and performance.
Race and ethnicity
Through racial and ethnic representation across our workforce we aim 
to reflect the communities in which we work. Shell's Global Council for 
Race is supported by an Employee Advisory Board which aims to 
advance diversity in our workforce.
Shell aims to maintain or exceed having at least one Board member 
from an ethnic minority background, while acknowledging that in 
periods of Board change this may not be achieved. As of December 31, 
2024, the Board had three members who identify as being from an 
ethnic minority group and one EC member who identifies as being 
from an ethnic minority group [A]. 
In support of the Parker Review recommendations, Shell aims to 
achieve 15% ethnic minority group representation in its Senior 
Management [B] by 2027. As of the end of 2024, 15% of Shell's 
Senior Management identifies as being from an ethnic minority group.
[A] Ethnic minority refers to an individual who self-identifies as Asian, Black, Mixed/multiple, or 
other ethnic minority group, in line with UK Office for National Statistics classifications.
[B] As per Parker Review recommendations, Senior Management refers to senior leadership 
based in the UK and is a Shell measure based on compensation grades. We have moved 
to this Shell definition of Senior Management for 2024 onwards to align with our self-
identification data collection and processes.
See "Nomination and Succession Committee" on pages 171-174 for our current talent 
management and succession process. 
In some countries, there are local restrictions on collecting and reporting 
race and ethnicity data. Shell offers employees the option to voluntarily 
declare their race and ethnicity via our self-identification initiative. 
See shell.com for more information on our DE&I progress in the UK, the USA and the 
Netherlands.

LGBT+
We are working to advance lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
plus (LGBT+) inclusion within Shell and the communities where we 
work. Most of our work around LGBT+ inclusion happens at a country 
level, in line with local policies, laws and regulations.
Disability inclusion and accessibility 
We are working to advance an inclusive, psychologically safe and 
accessible environment where people with disabilities can excel. We 
provide support and adjustments for people with disabilities during the 
recruitment process. For example, candidates with a disability or long-
term health condition can indicate whether they require adjustments to 
our facilities or our job application process. Our support teams and 
systems are equipped to make these adjustments if required. We also 
support employees throughout their careers with Shell, including access 
to educational resources, training programmes and personal and 
professional development. Our Disability, Accessibility and Inclusion 
portal provides comprehensive guidance and tools for line managers, 
leaders, people with disabilities and employees to be active allies. 
Shell's enABLE employee resource groups provide expertise and advice 
to Shell leaders and our businesses on accessibility and disability 
inclusion. We also offer a workplace accessibility service which covers 
68 locations in 33 countries. The team is supported by functions such 
as Shell Health, Human Resources, Real Estate and IT.
Shell is part of the Valuable 500, which comprises 500 of the world's 
largest companies and organisations that are working collectively to 
progress disability inclusion. We are also an active member of the 
Business Disability Forum and PurpleSpace.
Employee share plans
Our share plans align employees' interests with our performance 
through share ownership.
See the "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 188-207.
Discretionary share awards 
For 2024, Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards were made to 
Executive Directors and Senior Management, and Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) awards to nominated employees on a highly selective basis. 
These plans were designed to ensure that remuneration is clearly 
aligned with Shell's Operating Plan and/or longer-term strategic 
ambitions. Half of the performance conditions applied to the PSP are 
the same as those applied to the LTIP, and performance is measured 
over three years under both plans.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
For the 2024 LTIP, 25% of the award is linked to organic free cash flow 
and 25% to the energy transition, with the remaining 50% linked to 
comparative performance conditions. For the 2024 PSP, 50% of the 
award is linked to certain indicators described in "Performance 
indicators" on pages 18-19, averaged over the performance period, 
with the remaining 50% linked to the same performance conditions 
as for the LTIP.
See the "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 188-207.
For 2025, Restricted Share Awards (RSA) and/or Performance Share 
Awards (PSA) may be awarded to nominated employees on a highly 
selective basis. RSAs support employee retention over a three-year 
period and provide a stake in the Company's future. PSAs ensure that 
remuneration is clearly aligned with Shell's strategic ambitions and 
are measured over a three-year performance period. 
See "Annual Report on Remuneration" on page 206 for further information on the 
performance conditions.
Separately, following the BG acquisition, certain employee share 
awards made in 2015 under BG's Long-term Incentive Plan were 
automatically exchanged for equivalent awards of shares in the 
Company. The outstanding awards take the form of nil-cost options. 
Under all plans, vesting shares are increased by notional dividends 
accrued during the period from award to vesting. In certain 
circumstances, awards may be adjusted before delivery or be subject 
to clawback after delivery. None of the awards result in beneficial 
ownership until the shares vest.
See Note 28 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 305.
Global Employee Share Purchase Plan
Eligible employees in participating countries may participate in the 
Global Employee Share Purchase Plan. This plan enables them to make 
contributions from net pay towards the purchase of the Company's 
shares at a discount to the market price.
UK Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan
Eligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK may 
participate in the Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan, under 
which monthly contributions from gross pay are made towards the 
purchase of the Company's shares with a matching element.

Contribution to society
People's lives are better with energy. We help to power lives by 
providing vital energy for homes, businesses and transport, including 
for cooking, heating and lighting. Energy is also used to provide 
essential services, such as health care, and manufactured products 
which society consumes daily. Shell delivers energy for millions of 
people around the world every day and is working to help provide 
energy to those who do not yet have it.
For example, in November 2024, we joined forces with bp, Equinor 
and TotalEnergies to announce a $500 million joint investment 
commitment to help address the challenges of energy access. This joint 
investment seeks to support promising, high-impact projects, primarily in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and South-east Asia, that are working 
to bring access to electricity and improved cooking conditions to 
underserved communities.
We want to help communities benefit from having us as their neighbour. 
Some of the ways in which we make a meaningful contribution are by 
generating jobs and supporting start-ups and local businesses. In 2024, 
our operated and non-operated ventures spent around $42 billion on 
goods and services* from suppliers around the world, compared with 
$49 billion in 2023. This reduction is mainly driven by structural cost 
reductions and discipline and focus in cash capital expenditure as we 
implement our strategy. 
Photo: For more than 40 years, Shell LiveWire has helped entrepreneurs start and/or 
grow their businesses. Its biennial Top Ten Innovators awards selects young businesses 
that excel in social impact, environmental sustainability and business innovation. Camila 
de Araujo Reveles Barreira of Brazil was a Top Ten winner in 2023.
Our activities also generate revenues for governments through the 
taxes and royalties we pay, which can help governments to fund 
health care, education and other essential services. We publish an 
annual Tax Contribution Report which sets out the corporate income 
tax that Shell companies paid in the countries and locations where 
we have a taxable presence. In 2024, Shell paid $18 billion in taxes* 
to governments, of which $12 billion was paid in corporate income 
taxes and $6 billion in government royalties. 
See shell.com for the Tax Contribution Report.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
Supply chain
Our business activities depend on a competitive and resilient supply 
chain. Suppliers play an important role in helping to deliver our 
strategy and helping to create value for our stakeholders. 
As part of Shell's responsible sourcing approach, we aim to work with 
suppliers that behave in an economically, environmentally and socially 
responsible manner. Shell partners with suppliers who adhere to our 
Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles. The Shell 
Supplier Principles set out our expectations of suppliers with respect 
to business integrity; health, safety, security, environment and social 
performance (HSSE & SP); and labour and human rights. Our standard 
contract terms require adherence to these or equivalent principles.
Worker welfare
Our approach to worker welfare focuses on the well-being of supplier 
staff on Shell sites and dedicated supplier staff on non-Shell sites, where 
we have the most ability to influence safety, working conditions and 
labour rights. We also work with our partners and peers to include 
worker welfare in industry standards, guidance and best practice. This 
helps raise expectations and levels of consistency across the industry. 
Our approach is based on the principles established by Building 
Responsibly, an alliance of companies that seeks to promote the rights 
and welfare of workers in the engineering and construction industry.
In 2024, we continued to collaborate with peers and suppliers to 
drive consistency across the industry on worker welfare.
See shell.com for more information about how we engage with contractors and suppliers.
Working with communities
We engage with communities to help us understand their needs and 
expectations. This engagement enables us to identify and manage 
impacts from our activities and provide access to remedy. Engagement 
is a continuous process that helps us improve our decision-making and 
performance. Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
(SEAM) Standards are designed to help us to operate responsibly and 
avoid or minimise any potentially negative environmental and social 
impacts that may result from our operations. 
Communities can raise concerns in a number of ways. At large projects 
and assets, community engagement practitioners act as a bridge 
between local communities and our operations. Community feedback 
mechanisms allow us to receive, track and respond to questions and 
complaints. In 2024, we improved our internal tools to make it easier 
to track community satisfaction with the remedy offered by the process. 
Communities can also raise concerns anonymously through the Shell 
Global Helpline.
Our SEAM Standards require us to apply special procedures in 
situations involving involuntary resettlement, cultural heritage, 
Indigenous Peoples or operations in environments with high or unusual 
social risks. In 2024, we engaged with communities who were 
impacted by our business activities through involuntary resettlement 
which restricted their access to some areas on which they depend for 
their livelihoods. This occurred in Albania, Norway, South Korea, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK. Our engagement involved plans 
to manage these impacts. We also provided support to help avoid or 
manage involuntary resettlement impacts in our non-operated ventures.
See "Our approach to sustainability" on page 130. 
See shell.com for more information about our work with communities.

Social investment
Our activities contribute to economies through taxes, jobs and 
business opportunities. We also make social investments in areas 
determined by local community needs and priorities. These investments 
are sometimes voluntary, sometimes required by governments, or part 
of a contractual agreement. Shell has three priority areas for social 
investment: access to energy; skills and enterprise development; and 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.
In 2024, we spent $165 million on social investment, of which $87 
million (53%) was required by government regulations or contractual 
agreements. We spent the remaining $78 million (47%) on voluntary 
social investment.
See shell.com for more information about our social investment.
Human rights
Human rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, 
integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded 
in the Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. Shell 
is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. We work closely with various 
organisations to improve how we apply these UN guiding principles. 
In 2024, we continued to work on salient human rights issues (salient 
human rights are those that are most at risk from our operations). 
We prioritise four focus areas where respect for human rights is 
critical to how we operate: at the workplace including labour rights, 
in supply chains, communities and security. For each of these areas, we 
have systems to identify potential impacts and to avoid and mitigate 
them. Shell employees working in these focus areas need to complete 
mandatory human rights training. In addition, we encourage all 
employees to complete the course regardless of their role, to build 
greater understanding of human rights across Shell.
Human rights focus areas
See "Safety" on pages 122-124. 
See shell.com for more information about our approach to human rights.

Safety
Safety, along with our core values, underpins our strategy. 
We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across 
our operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.
The nature of our operations exposes us to a wide range of safety risks. 
We plan and execute our work with the aim of preventing harm to 
people or leaks to the environment and to be prepared to respond 
if something goes wrong.
We seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the 
safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal safety, 
process safety and transport safety. We strive to reduce risks and to 
minimise the potential impact of any incident. We place a particular 
emphasis on the risks that could lead to the most serious consequences 
if they materialised.
We continue our multi-year process of refreshing our approach to 
safety for all employees and contractors. This approach is rooted 
in a consistent focus on human performance. We ask people at Shell 
to apply a learner mindset, by which we mean the belief that we can 
always improve, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes 
and successes, and speak up freely without repercussions. 
In practice, our refreshed approach to safety is about enhancing 
how we prepare for and conduct high-risk activities by:
￮improving our preparation and execution of frontline work, building 
an environment of trust and learning;
￮ moving to industry-wide tools so that Shell and contractors work 
on the same basis to manage risks; and 
￮ using technology to reduce exposure and identify conditions that 
could lead to serious incidents.
It is also about capturing more insights by: 
￮focusing on serious injuries, illness and fatalities (SIF) and the lessons 
we can derive from high-potential incidents where the most serious 
consequences that could have led to SIF did not materialise;
￮ focusing on learning from losses or potential losses of containment, 
and on any degradation of barriers designed to prevent or minimise 
the consequences of leaks;
￮ capturing underlying causes through incident investigations; and 
￮ embedding lessons learned in our training and instructions for 
future work.
Our approach is governed by our Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management (SEAM) Standards, which set out our detailed 
requirements for personal, process and transport safety.
See "Our approach to sustainability" on page 130. 
Assurance activities play a key role for Shell in providing real-time 
feedback about our assets, businesses and functions regarding the 
health of critical human and technical safeguards that help prevent 
a safety incident. Our assurance activities aim to verify the design 
and functioning of controls, validate the overall efficiency of risk 
management, and highlight areas for improvement. 
We report data in this section on a 100% basis for companies and joint 
ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless stated otherwise.
Technology and safety
We are using digitalisation and artificial intelligence to gather and 
process data from our equipment and improve analysis and reporting. 
This enables remote support and allows us to take action quickly in 
unsafe situations. 
For example, we have installed T-Pulse, an AI-automated safety 
monitoring solution developed by Detect Technologies, at 26 sites. 
T-Pulse uses CCTV to identify and report real-time safety issues and 
unsafe behaviours. Since we began using T-Pulse in 2020, it has 
generated alerts for more than 20,000 potential safety issues. 
In more than 1,300 of those cases, interventions helped prevent 
significant harm to people or leaks into the environment.
We are installing active fatigue and distraction detection (AFDD) 
devices in vehicles operated by Shell employees or our contractors in 
countries where road transport risks are highest. These devices help us 
intervene earlier to prevent accidents by detecting the conditions that 
can lead to them.
Personal safety
We continue to strengthen the safety culture and leadership among 
our employees and contractors. This aligns with our focus on caring 
for people.
Our SEAM Standards establish requirements for occupational health 
and safety hazards that have the potential to result in harm to people. 
When our employees and contractors perform tasks, we expect them 
to consider the hazards that could potentially cause harm and the 
effectiveness of the barriers in place to prevent incidents and manage 
the consequences should an event occur. We establish and maintain 
competence management systems to help ensure people are 
competent to perform their roles and responsibilities. 
We run safety awareness programmes and hold an annual global 
Safety Day to give employees and contractors time to discuss safety 
culture on the frontline, reflect on how to prevent incidents, and how to 
improve performance. In 2024, the focus was on "Before I start work", 
which means pausing to reflect on what needs to be in place before 
we start work, for that work to be done safely.

Process safety
Process safety management is about keeping hazardous substances 
inside pipes, tanks and vessels, and ensuring that well fluids are 
contained during construction, interventions (such as maintenance) 
and incidents. Our SEAM Standards establish requirements from 
project design and construction throughout the life cycle of the asset 
to keep sites, employees, contractors and communities safe.
Our SEAM Standards set the steps we take to manage process safety 
risks, from identifying potential safety hazards to designing the controls 
that prevent them from occurring. Our standards require the use of 
barriers that operate independently of each other to reduce the 
likelihood of a release becoming catastrophic. Such barriers are 
designed so that if one fails, this does not lead to the failure of others.
We are focusing on standardising our risk assessment tools, improving 
human performance, working to mitigate process safety risks and 
moving from lagging indicators (measuring past outcomes) to leading 
indicators (predicting future performance). With the implementation of 
the SEAM Standards, our assurance methodologies for process safety 
have been updated to provide more insight on the health of barriers 
designed to reduce the likelihood of leaks and mitigate any potential 
consequences should a leak occur.
We continue to learn from investigations into industry incidents and 
embed this knowledge into our process safety standards and training 
programmes.
Preparing for emergencies
We prepare and practise our emergency response to incidents, such 
as a spill or a fire. This involves working closely with local emergency 
services and regulatory agencies to jointly test our plans and 
procedures. Shell requires key operating facilities to test their 
emergency response preparedness as per regulatory requirements 
and aligned to industry best practices. In 2024, we held large-scale 
emergency response exercises at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rotterdam in the Netherlands and in Perth, Australia for offshore 
exploration to support our Prelude floating LNG facility.
We manage three regional Emergency Response Leadership Councils 
for the Americas; Asia-Pacific; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
The councils bring together experts from different teams that need to be 
able to work together seamlessly in case of emergencies. In 2024, the 
councils' annual regional conferences covered a variety of topics such 
as lessons learned, dynamic risk assessments, new response technology, 
non-fluorinated firefighting foam tactics and response preparedness.
Transport safety
Transporting large numbers of people, products and equipment poses 
safety risks. We seek to reduce these risks by developing best-practice 
standards within Shell. We also work with specialist contractors, 
industry bodies, non-governmental organisations and governments 
to find ways of reducing transport safety risks.
Road safety
In 2024, we continued to focus on strengthening our controls and 
implementing technologies that help us to better detect the conditions 
which can lead to incidents. Our SEAM Standards require Shell 
employees and contractors who are identified as driving on work-
related business to receive defensive driver training.
In 2024, Shell employees and contractors drove around 424 million 
kilometres on company business, equivalent to around 10,580 times 
around the world. Commercial road transport accounts for most of 
the kilometres driven. There were 17 severe motor vehicle incidents 
(SMVIs). An SMVI is defined as a motor vehicle incident resulting in 
a fatality, serious injury or a rollover of a vehicle. There were no road 
transport-related fatalities in 2024.
Maritime safety
At the end of 2024, we managed and operated a global fleet of 22 
tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and the world's first liquefied 
hydrogen carrier. We are one of the world's largest charterers of oil 
and gas vessels. We work with our global maritime partners through 
our Maritime Partners in Safety Programme to improve the safety 
performance of the shipping industry.
Air safety
In 2024, for Shell-operated ventures, our owned and contracted 
aircraft flew around 37,000 hours and carried around 292,000 Shell 
and contractor passengers to destinations across the world. In 
addition, remotely piloted aircraft completed flights on surveys, 
inspections, emissions surveillance, and security and incident response.
See shell.com for more information on transport safety.
Working with others
We work with contractors and suppliers to help them understand 
our safety requirements. We strive to improve the energy industry's 
safety performance by sharing safety standards and experience 
with other operators, joint-venture partners, contractors and 
professional organisations. 
Executives from Shell and our major contractor companies have 
collaborated on Shell's contractor safety leadership programme since 
2014. The programme seeks to identify strategies and practical ways 
to improve a shared safety culture and achieve our Goal Zero ambition 
of no harm and no leaks.

Safety performance
Tragically, two of our contractor colleagues in Shell-operated ventures 
lost their lives in incidents which happened in 2024 while working for 
us. One contractor colleague in the Netherlands lost his life in an 
accident at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Moerdijk in June 2024. 
Another contractor colleague in India was bitten by a snake in May 
2024 and subsequently passed away in January 2025.
We sadly note that a contractor who sustained burn injuries in a flash 
fire at our EcoOils facility in Malaysia in February 2025 passed away 
later that month. The investigation into the incident remained under 
way at the time of publishing this report. 
The death in February 2024 of a contractor colleague in Nigeria, who 
was injured in a fire incident in December 2023, was reported in our 
2023 Annual Report. 
Shell is profoundly impacted by these losses. We are resolutely 
committed to learn from these incidents and we aim to take all 
necessary measures to prevent anything similar from happening again. 
We continue to work closely with our contractors to help build a strong 
safety culture at the frontline.
We use serious injury, illness and fatality (SIF) and serious injury, illness 
and fatality frequency (SIF-F) to measure our safety performance. SIF 
is defined as a serious work-related injury or illness that resulted in a 
fatality or a permanent impairment, which is defined as a long-term or 
permanent injury or illness with a significant impact on daily activities. 
SIF-F is calculated by dividing the number of employee and contractor 
SIF by 100 million working hours. SIF-F enables us to focus our 
investigations on the most serious incidents. The aim is to collect 
and analyse relevant, high-quality data that can help us improve 
our efforts to prevent serious injuries and fatalities.
In 2024, the number of serious work-related injuries or illnesses, 
including those that resulted in fatality or permanent impairment, 
decreased to 7 from 12 in 2023. The SIF-F was 1.5 cases per 100 
million working hours compared with 2.6 in 2023. 
For reporting on process safety, we combine Tier 1 and 2 events. A Tier 
1 process safety event is an unplanned or uncontrolled release of any 
material from a process, including non-toxic and non-flammable 
materials, with the greatest actual consequence resulting in harm to 
employees, contract staff or a neighbouring community, damage to 
equipment, or exceeding a defined threshold quantity. A Tier 2 
process safety event is a release of lesser consequence.
The number of Tier 1 and 2 operational process safety events in 2024 
increased compared with 2023. There were 90 events reported during 
the year compared with 63 in 2023. The increase in process safety 
tiered events was driven by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy 
Solutions business. We are actively addressing these challenges by 
refining our operational strategies, renewing our focus on fundamentals 
and leveraging new technologies to return to the downward trend of 
previous years.
A well control incident is defined as a well set-up with fewer than two 
barriers in place to protect it against a release through any potential 
path. In 2024, there were no Level 1 or Level 2 well control incidents 
in Shell-operated ventures. There were also no events in 2023.
As part of our learner mindset approach, we investigate serious 
incidents so we can understand the underlying causes, including 
technical, behavioural, organisational and human factors. We share 
what we learn, including with contractors. We implement mitigations 
at the site and in the country and business where the incident occurred. 
We seek to turn incident findings into improved standards or better 
ways of working that can be applied widely across similar facilities.
Security
Our operations expose us to criminality, civil unrest, activism, terrorism, 
cyber disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse 
effect on our business. Our security risk mitigations follow the principles 
of "deter, detect, delay and respond". We strengthen the security of our 
assets, people and operations to reduce our exposure as appropriate, 
for example, by conducting site security risk assessments, using journey 
management plans and performing travel risk assessments. We also 
invest in information risk management capabilities and crisis 
management and business continuity measures. 
Shell is a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights (VPSHR), a multi-stakeholder initiative that gives guidance on 
how to respect human rights while providing security for business 
operations. We implement this guidance within our own operations, 
concentrating on countries where the risks of working with government 
and private security providers are identified as greatest.

Living by our values
Our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people, as 
well as our focus on safety and sustainability are critical to our 
strategy. We are committed to doing business in an ethical and 
transparent way.
Ethics and transparency
Our core values underpin our work with employees, customers, 
investors, contractors, suppliers, non-governmental organisations, the 
communities where we operate and others. The Shell General Business 
Principles (SGBP), Code of Conduct, and Ethics and Compliance 
Manual are designed to help everyone at Shell to act in line with our 
values. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer (CECO) reports to the 
Shell Legal Director. The CECO is the custodian of Shell's Code of 
Conduct, and oversees ethics and compliance activities.
Shell General Business Principles 
The SGBP set out our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, 
employees, business partners and society. They set the standards for 
how we conduct business with integrity, care and respect for people. 
As part of these principles, we commit to contribute to sustainable 
development. All Shell employees and contractors, and those working 
at joint ventures we operate, are expected to behave in line with these 
principles. We undertake a range of activities to help embed the SGBP 
and the Code of Conduct throughout the organisation. This includes 
training and encouraging people to discuss the dilemmas they face in 
their work.
Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct explains how employees, contractors and 
anyone else acting on Shell's behalf must behave to live up to our 
business principles. It addresses key topics including safety, anti-bribery 
and corruption, fair competition and human rights.
Shell employees, contractors and third parties with whom Shell has a 
business relationship can report any potential breaches of the Code of 
Conduct confidentially through several channels, including 
anonymously through a global helpline operated by an independent 
provider. We maintain a stringent no retaliation policy to protect any 
person making an allegation in good faith. This protection extends to 
those who participate in or conduct an investigation. We investigate 
allegations of potential violations of the Code of Conduct or applicable 
laws promptly and independently of the management line concerned.
In 2024, there were 2,025 reports to the Shell Global Helpline. We 
confirmed 343 breaches of the Code of Conduct, 367 employees 
or contractors were subject to disciplinary action, and of those 110 
people were dismissed. Confirmed breaches include cases in which 
an allegation received in 2024 or a prior year was substantiated 
and closed.
Ethics and compliance 
Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual defines the detailed 
requirements for our businesses and functions to comply with laws 
on anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, preventing the 
facilitation of tax evasion, antitrust, data privacy and trade compliance.
Our employees receive guidance on the requirements listed in our 
Ethics and Compliance Manual -- including via a dedicated website, 
and training modules where completion is monitored -- which is 
reinforced by messages from Shell leaders on these requirements. This 
manual also includes the Protect Shell Policy, which explains Shell's 
position on managing antitrust risks in engagements with parties 
external to Shell. In response to fast-moving external antitrust 
developments and trends, internal guidance is continually being 
monitored to ensure that it remains relevant. 
The type and depth of training is dependent on the level of risk. 
Training is repeated every three years, or more frequently for positions 
where the risk exposure is higher. Those considered to be higher 
risk for exposure to bribery include, but are not limited to, persons 
involved in procurement and contracting, new business development 
and engaging with government officials. Shell Internal Audit and 
Investigations (SIAI) conducts risk-based audits of potential ethics and 
compliance issues across its operations in support of our Group-wide 
ethics and compliance programme.
To help manage antitrust, competition, anti-bribery, tax evasion, anti-
money laundering and trade compliance risks with adequate resources 
we maintain risk-based compliance programmes, a comprehensive 
governance structure, established reporting lines and policies and 
procedures, including mandatory due diligence, counterparty-screening 
and regular risk assessments. 
Compliance in our Trading and Supply business
We maintain a Trading Compliance function managed by a Chief 
Compliance Officer, as regulated by the UK Financial Conduct 
Authority, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the 
Securities Commission of The Bahamas, with adequate resources, 
including employees and a budget; a comprehensive governance 
structure, controls, policies and procedures and established reporting 
lines. Employees in Shell's trading organisation receive clear guidance 
through the Code of Conduct; the organisation's Trading and Supply 
Compliance Manual, supplemented with specific policies; a specific 
compliance website; mandatory training modules where completion 
is monitored; and other relevant training. 
Strategic Report | Performance in the year
125 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 128 ----
Shell leaders reinforce the importance of managing compliance and 
conduct risk in the trading organisation through monitoring risk metrics, 
reporting to compliance risk management and governance committees, 
setting clear expectations via townhall meetings and other channels, 
and enforcing consequences for non-compliance.
Shell's Trading Compliance function has systems for trade surveillance 
and monitoring communication, in addition to a dedicated conduct and 
ethics investigation function to assess breaches of non-compliance and 
thematic trends.
Data protection
With regard to the protection of personal data, we continue to invest in 
and develop a mature and robust privacy compliance programme 
based on our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). Every Shell company is 
required to manage personal data in a professional, ethical and lawful 
manner. We have a robust "privacy by design" process, which includes 
the monitoring of data privacy regulations, to help ensure that 
necessary controls are built into our IT systems and solutions to protect 
personal data.
Shell's Chief Privacy Officer serves as the Data Protection Officer (DPO) 
under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other 
applicable data privacy laws, except where there is a requirement to 
have a locally based DPO, such as in China and the Philippines. 
We monitor new data privacy legislation and seek to ensure we have 
a robust impact assessment process in place for the relevant businesses. 
We design our operations and processes based on relevant data 
privacy requirements and we build controls into our processes and 
practices which cover the handling of personal data. 
We maintain a Group-wide incident management process designed to 
identify and remediate data privacy breaches. The process also helps us 
to comply with country-level requirements for reporting breaches. Some 
of our acquired companies are not yet in full compliance with our BCRs. 
Following assessments for each of those companies, specific actions are 
planned and put in place to achieve compliance, with regular updates 
made on their progress to management.
Reputation and brand
We continually assess and monitor the external environment for 
potential risks to our reputation. We engage in dialogue with our key 
stakeholders, such as investors, industry and trade groups, academics, 
governments and non-governmental organisations to gain greater 
insights into societal expectations of the Shell Group. We make efforts 
to explain to our stakeholders what the Company is doing and why, 
the validity of our energy transition targets and our progress towards 
meeting them. We take proactive steps when appropriate through 
legal means to protect our reputation from unwarranted accusations.

Our approach 
to sustainability
Our commitment to contribute to sustainable development has been 
part of the Shell General Business Principles since 1997. We have 
embedded this sustainability commitment into our strategy, business 
processes and decision-making, supported by comprehensive 
governance structures, policies and standards. 
Our approach to sustainability takes into account the impacts, risks 
and opportunities related to climate, nature, safety, ethics, people and 
communities -- from the global to the local level. For 2024 progress in 
each of these areas, refer to the Our journey to net zero, Respecting 
nature, Powering lives, Safety, and Living by our values sections. 
In anticipation of the transposition by the Netherlands of the EU 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) into national 
law, a key development for Shell in 2024 has been the voluntary 
implementation of the CSRD and the accompanying European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The CSRD requires certain 
European and non-European companies (including Shell plc due to its 
listing on Euronext Amsterdam) to make disclosures on environmental, 
social and governance topics in accordance with reporting standards 
set out in the ESRS.
For the first time, in the Annual Report and Accounts 2024, Shell 
includes a Sustainability Statements section (pages 341-440), 
prepared on a voluntary basis in accordance with the CSRD and ESRS. 
The Sustainability Statements incorporates Shell's EU Taxonomy 
disclosure, which we have published on voluntary basis since 2021. The 
Sustainability Statements section forms an integral part of the 
consolidated management report [A]. With the introduction of the 
Sustainability Statements, we have retired our voluntary Sustainability 
Report after 27 years. 
[A] The consolidated management report, as referenced in the CSRD, includes the Strategic 
Report and Governance sections of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Governance
Board oversight of sustainability including
climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities 
Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver our 
strategy, which is to deliver more value with less emissions, while 
powering lives and respecting nature. 
See "Our strategy" on pages 10-13.
We describe Shell's overall governance framework on pages 159-160 
and provide information on the roles of the Board of Directors, Board 
Committees and the Executive Committee (EC).
See "Sustainability including climate governance" on page 129.
The Board has primary oversight of the delivery of Shell's strategy and 
monitors performance against our longer-term business targets. This 
includes the management of sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities. 
The Board periodically reviews our energy transition plans and 
oversees their implementation and delivery. In March 2024, Shell 
published the updated Energy Transition Strategy 2024, as endorsed 
by the Board, which included our four climate targets and ambition. 
The progress on these longer-term climate-related targets and ambition 
can be found in "Climate-related metrics and targets" on pages 93-106.
In 2024, the Board considered sustainability-related matters 
throughout the year, such as the assessment of sustainability-related 
risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. 
The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, with 
consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and 
divestments. In 2024, the Board convened nine times and continued 
to oversee our strategy and sustainability initiatives, including at the 
Board off-site days in June 2024.
The nature of topics discussed by the Board in 2024 can be found 
in "Board activities" on pages 161-164. A full description of 
sustainability-related principal risks can be found in the "Risk factors" 
on pages 134-144.

Board committees
The Board is supported by four standing committees: the Sustainability 
Committee (SUSCO), the Remuneration Committee (REMCO), the 
Audit and Risk Committee (ARC), and the Nomination and Succession 
Committee (NOMCO). Sustainability-related matters are considered 
by the Board or the relevant committee, as appropriate. Committees, 
comprising Non-executive Directors, provide regular updates to the 
Board, including from committee meetings and stakeholder 
engagements.
The SUSCO reviews the performance of Shell with respect to 
sustainability and the non-financial elements of Shell's strategy, with a 
focus on nature and social elements. The SUSCO also reviews selected 
sustainability topics and matters of public concern. The SUSCO met 
four times in 2024 with sustainability-related matters discussed at each 
meeting. Details on focus areas and meetings in 2024 can be found in 
the SUSCO report on page 175.
The REMCO develops the remuneration policy and schemes for 
Executive Directors, EC members and the majority of Shell's employees, 
and sets performance conditions designed to challenge and support 
the EC in meeting our strategy of more value with less emissions, while 
respecting nature and powering lives. The REMCO met five times 
during 2024, with sustainability-related matters relevant to 
remuneration being regularly addressed. Details of the REMCO's focus 
areas and meetings in 2024 can be found in the Directors' 
Remuneration Report on pages 188-190. 
The NOMCO leads the process for appointments to the Board and 
Senior Management and oversees the development of a diverse 
succession line of candidates. The NOMCO also reviews the 
Company's policy, targets and strategy on diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DE&I), and monitors the effectiveness of these initiatives. The 
NOMCO met four times, with sustainability-related matters regularly 
addressed. Details on the NOMCO's focus areas and meetings in 
2024 can be found in the NOMCO report on pages 171-174.
The ARC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in 
areas such as the effectiveness of our risk management and internal 
controls. The ARC also provides oversight in respect of material non-
financial reporting disclosures with respect to corporate sustainability 
as applicable to the Company's annual reports, half-yearly reports and 
quarterly results releases. Significant issues identified by the business or 
functional owners are escalated to and reviewed by the ARC as 
required. The ARC met six times in 2024, with sustainability-related 
matters regularly addressed. Details on the ARC's focus areas and 
meetings in 2024 can be found in the ARC report on pages 176-187.
Performance and remuneration
Our remuneration schemes, including the annual bonus and long-term 
incentive awards, are designed to support Shell in achieving our 
strategy. Almost all employees participate in the annual bonus scheme. 
Executive Directors, senior executives and certain key employees 
participate in the long-term incentive awards, which aim to retain and 
ensure recipients have a greater investment in Shell's future.
In respect of 2024 outcomes, Shell's safety and energy transition-
related performance metrics each form 15% of the annual bonus 
scorecard. A metric for "Shell's journey in the energy transition" forms 
20% of the long-term incentive awards for Executive Directors and 
senior executives and 10% for all other employees. 
The remuneration schemes are all linked to sustainability elements, 
including climate and safety. The Directors' Remuneration Report 
provides further details on key sustainability-related performance 
indicators.
Supporting governance committees
There are three key supporting management committees, with 
representatives from across Shell, which play a critical role in 
driving sustainability-related elements of our strategy. These committees 
each have direct lines of reporting to the Board and its committees.
￮The Capital Investment Committee (CIC) facilitates portfolio 
management and capital allocation decisions, and reviews each 
investment opportunity that is, due to its size or risk profile, subject 
to approval by the CEO or the Board. These reviews ensure that
risk-reward trade-offs and other defined criteria (including carbon 
emissions impacts) are embedded in investment decision-making. The 
CIC is sponsored by the CEO and is accountable to the Board. This 
committee is made up of senior executives, including the CEO, CFO 
and individual business directors.
￮ The Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC) is sponsored by the CFO 
and includes senior management representatives focusing on 
climate-related matters from across the businesses, Projects & 
Technology climate-related disciplines, and functions including 
Finance, Legal and Strategy. The CRC is responsible at the Group 
level for the Carbon Reporting Control Framework, the calculation 
methodologies and reporting of GHG emissions metrics, and the 
review and approval of external GHG-related disclosures to ensure 
compliance.
￮ The Sustainability Management Committee (SMC), established in 
October 2024, is sponsored by the CFO and includes senior 
management representatives with exposure to material sustainability 
areas from the businesses and functions, including Supply Chain, 
Finance, Legal and Human Resources. The SMC aims to provide an 
integrated approach to sustainability by addressing cross-directorate 
risks and dilemmas, and driving the co-ordination, simplification and 
performance improvement of nature and social sustainability topics, 
focusing on regulatory compliance and value protection and 
creation. The SMC will also maintain a forward view on emerging 
themes to ensure Shell's future competitiveness and resilience 
through the energy transition.
In addition to these committees, our network of country chairs supports 
the overall governance, development and deployment of sustainability-
related initiatives. They facilitate the setting of each country's plans and 
their engagement with external stakeholders in support of our strategy.
Business assurance
Each EC member must submit an annual assurance letter to the CEO 
that their business or function's activities have been conducted 
in accordance with the requirements set out in our Commitment and 
Policy on Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Social Performance 
(HSSE & SP) and our Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
(SEAM) Standards. This assurance includes an assessment of the 
effectiveness of our internal controls in managing sustainability-
related risks. 
Independent assurance
Shell Internal Audit and Investigations (SIAI) provides independent 
assurance of sustainability-related risks as part of its broader mandate 
and advises management and the Board on the effectiveness of 
internal controls. For further information, see "Internal Audit" on 
page 184.

Processes by which management is informed about 
sustainability including climate-related issues 
We have several processes to help ensure that management teams can 
effectively monitor and manage sustainability matters. Our response to 
the evolving risk outlook requires transparency and clarity around our 
plans and actions to achieve our sustainability targets. 
We have established a number of policies, standards, frameworks, 
internal forums and capability development programmes related to 
sustainability, climate change and the energy transition. These are 
employed at all levels of the organisation and seek to monitor, 
manage and review sustainability issues. 
Each business and function regularly reviews its risk profile, risk 
responses and assurance activities throughout the year to ensure 
sustainability-related risks are effectively addressed and managed. 
These reviews and insights are also used to provide management with 
regular updates on the operational management of sustainability and 
to help us to update our plans and guide our day-to-day operational 
decisions and our risk response plans.
Policies and standards
Our commitment to contribute to sustainable development has been 
part of the Shell General Business Principles (SGBP) since 1997. These 
principles are supported by our Code of Conduct, which describe the 
behaviours expected of our employees with regard to sustainability-
related matters including health, safety, security, environment and 
social performance (HSSE & SP), human rights and equal opportunities.
The Shell Performance Framework (SPF) is the overarching framework 
adopted by Shell to deliver on its strategy and business objectives. It 
applies to all Shell companies and provides a consistent approach for 
how each company in Shell operates. This framework includes our risk 
management and internal control procedures to support adherence 
to the SGBP and Code of Conduct.
See "Living by our values" on pages 125-126 and "Shell Performance Framework" on 
page 221.
Shell's policies and standards aligned with the Shell Performance Framework (SPF)
Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP
The Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP is a set of core 
principles intended to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, 
minimise environmental impact, respect our neighbours and contribute 
to sustainable development.
SEAM Standards
We have implemented the Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP 
into a set of five standards under the SPF collectively referred to as 
the Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards. 
The SEAM Standards require the businesses, projects and assets we 
operate to identify and manage impacts, risks and opportunities so 
their activities can be carried out in a safe, environmentally responsible 
and consistent way.
We seek to avoid HSSE impacts and risks where we are able to. We 
follow requirements set out in our SEAM Standards to develop suitable 
governance structures and mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring that 
if an HSSE risk materialises, we avoid the worst possible consequences 
and have ways to remediate any environmental damage. For example, 
requirements in the SEAM Standards describe the key controls to be 
implemented to ensure safe production and equipment care, and the 
type of skills and training that are required for relevant staff.
Each project, asset or business is accountable to assess which 
mandatory requirements are relevant based on their objectives, risk 
profile and activities, and apply these via their local management 
system. The requirements are designed to be outcome-based -- meaning 
they define the desired results and allow the business to determine a fit-
for-purpose process to achieve them. They are supported by practice 
documents, which share best practices for implementation, as well 
as assurance protocols to assist in testing the health of controls. 
Strategic Report | Performance in the year | Our approach to sustainability continued
130 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 133 ----
The requirements align with industry standards where practicable. 
Where applicable, we follow the most stringent of either our SEAM 
Standards or local regulations. In some cases, where no local 
regulation exists, our standards set mandatory requirements 
based on internationally accepted standards or practices.
Requests for exceptions from the SEAM Standards must be reviewed 
and advised on by subject matter experts and authorised by a senior 
executive for the relevant business, asset or function. Permanent 
exceptions are reviewed on an annual basis and are subject to 
conditions.
The SEAM Standards came into effect in July 2024, replacing the 
former HSSE & SP Control Framework and Asset Management System 
(AMS). The five SEAM Standards are described below. 
SEAM Standards 
HSSE & SP and Asset Management Foundations
This standard includes requirements intended to manage the common 
elements of our processes and management systems. This includes our 
assurance processes, HSSE & SP risk management practices, impact 
assessments, contractor HSSE management, performance monitoring 
and reporting, and learning and improvement, among others.
Carbon, Environment, Social Performance, Product 
Stewardship and Quality
This standard includes managing our decarbonisation targets, 
protecting biodiversity, preserving water quality, improving air quality 
and increasing circularity. It also covers the mitigation of social impacts 
arising from our business activities and management of any adverse 
effects of the products we make, buy, sell or handle.
See "Our journey to net zero" on page 80, "Respecting nature" on page 109 and 
"Powering lives" on page 114.
Workplace Health, Safety, and Security
This standard is about protecting workers involved in our activities from 
potential health and safety hazards that may cause harm to them or 
others. It includes worker welfare and labour rights, and contains 
requirements intended to protect our people and assets from 
adversarial activities.
Process Safety and Asset Management
This standard is about keeping hazardous substances contained in 
wells, pipes, tanks and vessels. In the SEAM Standards, we have 
integrated Asset Management work processes with Asset Integrity-
Process Safety Management, which streamlines requirements and 
recognises the alignment of operating safely and optimising production 
in our assets.
Transport Safety
This standard is about reducing the safety risks posed during transport 
of people, products and materials by road, rail, sea or air.
See "Safety" on pages 122-124.

Sustainability impact, risk and opportunity 
management 
We use two key processes for assessing and managing 
sustainability including climate-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities — Impact Assessments and the Hazards and Effects 
Management Process (HEMP). These are covered in the HSSE & 
SP and Asset Management Foundations Standard in alignment 
with our broader risk management practice in the SPF. For more 
information on our risk management processes, see "Risk 
management" on page 134.
When planning projects, we conduct impact assessments, which 
help us to identify and assess a project's potential impact on the 
environment, people and communities. Once identified, we apply 
a mitigation hierarchy, which is a sequence of actions to manage 
potential impacts and risks. For example, in a biodiversity context 
we seek to avoid, minimise, restore and offset.
HEMP is applied to identify, assess and manage HSSE & SP risks 
in our projects and operations. This systemic approach starts 
with the identification of potential hazards (such as working at 
heights) and evaluation of their likelihood and potential impact. 
We then implement controls (such as fall protection) to reduce 
the risks to as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP). In doing 
this, we apply the hierarchy of controls, which prioritises the 
elimination, substitution and isolation of hazards, before 
implementing engineered safeguards, administrative controls 
and personal protective equipment. We monitor the 
effectiveness of these controls via regular assurance activities. 
Non-operated ventures 
More than half of Shell's joint ventures are not operated by 
Shell. As per our SGBP, Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP 
and our joint venture requirements in the HSSE & SP and Asset 
Management Foundations Standard, we request non-operated 
ventures (NOVs) to apply policies and principles materially 
equivalent to our own and, in relation to particular (higher 
impact) risks implement materially equivalent standards or 
standards acceptable to us. We do not have direct control over 
how these ventures embed sustainability in their operations, but 
we do seek to influence and offer support. We periodically 
evaluate the sustainability including climate-related impacts, risks 
and opportunities within our NOVs, and if an NOV does not 
meet our expectations, we seek to influence them to implement 
performance improvement plans.
Sustainability including climate through the life cycle
Our principles, policies and standards regarding sustainability, 
including climate, extend across the entire lifespan of a project or the 
facility -- from initial design and construction or acquisition to operation 
over many years and, finally, divestment or decommissioning. 
Acquisitions and divestments
Shell considers new business investment opportunities and divesting 
from existing opportunities in all relevant contexts including regulations, 
sustainability and alignment with our strategy. Sustainability 
considerations, including emissions, are considered during the due 
diligence process and in negotiations for material acquisitions and 
divestments. Comprehensive stakeholder engagement plans are 
developed, as appropriate, in parallel to the negotiations.
We take care to invest and divest responsibly and screen our 
transactions against multiple criteria. Before acquiring or divesting a 
business, we assess the counterparty's financial strength; operating 
culture; policies governing HSSE & SP; ethics and compliance; and, 
where relevant, the effectiveness of its social performance programmes.
Within each divestment proposal, we consider if the potential 
purchaser has the capability to manage the assets and surrounding 
environment. When we divest assets or exit areas, we apply well-
established processes to guide our risk assessment and the transition of 
sustainability-related responsibilities and commitments, including those 
relating to health, safety, security and environment. Where applicable, 
we also share our emissions reduction plans with the purchaser in 
relation to compliance with regulations and commitments, for the 
purchaser's consideration.
Decommissioning and restoration
Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every asset or 
operation. We aim to abandon wells and decommission installations in 
a safe, efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner 
while meeting regulatory requirements. This includes restoring the 
surroundings of these installations in line with relevant legislation, while 
taking our own environmental standards into account. We seek to 
reuse, repurpose and recycle materials in decommissioning. Current 
and non-current decommissioning liabilities and other provisions are 
accounted for on our balance sheet.
See Note 25 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 297. 
Working with others
Shell understands the need to work with others to achieve our 
commercial, environmental and social goals. We engage with local 
communities and other stakeholders in all our activities. We listen to 
their ideas and the concerns they might have so these can be 
addressed in the design and operation of our assets.
Shell participates in external collaborations, industry associations 
and partnerships. We do this in compliance with antitrust rules and 
regulations. These engagements are a proven way to learn and share 
best practices, achieve specific objectives and build trust with the many 
different stakeholders who have an interest in Shell. Our key 
sustainability, including climate, partnerships include the International 
Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Ipieca (the global oil 
and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social 
performance across the energy transition), the Energy Transitions 
Commission (ETC), Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). These 
organisations, and many others, help inform our thinking on sustainability 
including climate-related risks, opportunities and good practices.

Risk management 
and risk factors
Risk management 
How we manage risks 
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining procedures 
to manage risk, overseeing the internal control framework, and 
determining the nature and extent of the principal risks that Shell 
is willing to take to achieve its long-term strategic objectives.
Our approach to managing risk sits at the heart of the Shell 
Performance Framework and is embedded in the Improvement Cycle 
which integrates performance management, risk management, learning 
and improvement. This approach is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve our business objectives and 
covers the areas below.
See Shell Performance Framework on page 220.
Risk identification 
We employ different methods to identify risks. These include monitoring 
external developments, such as policy changes and new regulations. 
We also assess changes in the internal operating context, such as 
monitoring incidents that have occurred across our activities to 
determine if these could give rise to new risks.
We seek to identify and define risks across the spectrum of strategic, 
operational, conduct and culture risks. With strategic risks, we consider 
the current and future portfolio, examining parameters such as country 
concentration or exposure to higher-risk countries. We consider long-
range developments to test key assumptions or beliefs in relation to 
energy markets. When assessing operational risks, we consider 
exposures across our value chain. Through conduct and culture risks, 
we consider how our policies and practices align with our purpose, 
core values and desired mindset and behaviours.
These perspectives help us to maintain a comprehensive view of the 
different types of risks we face and the different time horizons during 
which they may affect us.
Risk assessment 
To further understand the risks we face, we evaluate the impact and 
likelihood of each risk occurring. 
When assessing the potential impact of a risk, we consider its 
materiality in terms of the possible financial consequences. We also 
consider the impacts on people, the environment and the community 
where we operate, our reputation and our ability to comply with 
external regulations. For example, the technical complexity of our 
operations gives rise to safety risks, which could result in injuries, 
loss of life, environmental harm and financial losses. 
When assessing the likelihood of a risk occurring, we consider several 
factors, such as the level of risk exposure, our ability to prevent the risk 
happening and whether the risk has occurred in the past. 
To support risk assessments, we also seek to establish and articulate 
our risk appetite, which is the level of risk that we are willing to accept 
in pursuit of Shell's strategy and objectives. We consider the resources 
available – such as financial resources, people, processes, systems and 
controls – that we are willing and able to allocate to manage each risk 
in pursuit of our objectives and the impact on Shell's overall risk profile. 
The financial framework, which shapes Shell's financial resilience, sets 
an overarching boundary condition for risk appetite. The impact and 
likelihood assessments, combined with risk appetite, determine the type 
of risk responses, such as controls and assurance activities, that may be 
required to manage each risk. The impact and likelihood assessments 
also help us to prioritise risks by understanding their significance to our 
strategy and objectives, individually and relative to other risks. 
Risk response 
Risk responses are developed based on the assessment of impact, 
likelihood and risk appetite.
Possible responses include:
￮ taking the risk while using appropriate processes and controls to 
maintain the risk within risk appetite. These processes and controls 
include, for example, the requirements and guidance in the Shell 
General Business Principles, Code of Conduct and our Group 
Standards, which establish the mandatory rules that are to be 
applied in all Shell companies and operations;
￮ transferring the risk, for example to insurance providers where 
appropriate; and 
￮ avoiding the risk, by stopping or exiting the activity that gives rise 
to the risk or doing the activity differently.
We use assurance activities to objectively assess the effectiveness of 
our risk management activities and to improve them.
Emerging risks 
Management and the Board also consider emerging risks. These are 
defined as risks where the scope, impact and likelihood are still 
uncertain, but which may have a significant effect on achieving Shell's 
strategy and objectives in the future. These are identified through the 
monitoring of external developments, the status of risk indicators, 
learnings from incidents and assurance findings, and the appraisal of 
Shell's forward-looking plans. Once identified, we undertake activities 
to monitor, prepare for and plan appropriate responses, should 
such emerging risks occur.
In 2024, management and the Board considered the pace and 
evolution of technological developments in areas such as artificial 
intelligence and quantum computing as emerging risks, given their 
potential impacts, for example, on cyber security and data protection. 
The Board also considered the risks of the evolving landscape of 
geopolitical tensions for the Group.
Management and Board risk reviews 
Throughout the year, each business and function regularly reviews 
its risk profile, risk responses and assurance activities to ensure 
that significant risks are managed effectively. 
The Board, Board committees and management also regularly review 
Shell's principal risks or risk factors, conducting deeper dives on 
individual risks, as appropriate. These reviews also support management 
in assessing the effectiveness of existing risk management activities, and 
whether changes may be needed.
See "Other regulatory and statutory information" on pages 216-223 for other Board and 
Board committee responsibilities on risk management.

Risk factors
The risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect 
separately, or in combination, on our earnings, cash flows and 
financial condition. Accordingly, investors should carefully 
consider these risks.
Further background on each risk is set out in the relevant sections of this 
Report, indicated by way of cross references.
1. Portfolio risks Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
We are exposed to risks that could adversely affect the resilience of our overall portfolio of businesses. These include 
external risks such as macroeconomic risks, including fluctuating commodity prices and competitive forces. Our future 
performance depends on the successful development and deployment of new technologies that provide 
new products and solutions. In addition, our future hydrocarbon production depends on the delivery of integrated 
projects and our ability to replace proved oil and gas reserves. Many of our major projects and operations are 
conducted in joint arrangements or with associates. This could reduce our degree of control and our ability to identify 
and manage risks.
Risk description
We are exposed to various external risks, such as macroeconomic and competitive risks, and internal risks associated with growing and maturing 
our business opportunities through our portfolio of businesses and joint arrangements, as follows:
Macroeconomic risks:
￮ The prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals can be volatile and are affected by supply and demand, both globally and 
regionally. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues; natural disasters; pandemics; political instability; conflicts, such 
as the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East; economic conditions, including inflation; and actions by major oil and gas 
producing countries. These have in the past resulted in, and similar events could in the future result in, material price fluctuations. In addition, 
macroeconomic, geopolitical and technological uncertainties have affected, and could affect in the future, production costs and demand for our 
products. Government actions may affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. These include price caps on gas, 
tariffs, the promotion of electric vehicle sales or the phasing-out of future sales of new diesel or petrol vehicles. Oil and gas prices have moved 
independently of each other and could do so in the future. 
￮ Under high oil and gas prices, our entitlement to proved reserves under some production-sharing contracts has been, and could be in the 
future, reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for our products which could result in lower profitability in certain businesses in the 
Group, particularly in our Chemicals and Products, and Marketing businesses. Some of the reduction in demand could be permanent. Higher 
prices can also lead to more capacity being built, potentially resulting in an oversupplied market which would negatively affect our businesses. 
In the past, a high oil and gas price environment has generally led to sharp increases in costs and this could happen in the future.
￮ In a low oil and gas price environment, we have generated, and could in the future again generate, less revenue from our Upstream and 
Integrated Gas businesses, and parts of those businesses could become less profitable or incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted, 
and could result in the future, in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of price environment. 
Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted, and could result in the future, in projects being delayed or cancelled. 
Assets have been impaired in the past, and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices have affected, and could affect in 
the future, our ability to maintain our long-term capital investment and shareholder distribution programmes. 
￮ We use a range of commodity price and margin assumptions to evaluate the robustness of our capital allocation across our different projects 
and commercial opportunities. Due to volatility in macroeconomic conditions, our assumptions have proven to be incorrect in the past, yielding 
returns that are less than what we planned, and could prove incorrect in the future. 
Competitive risks:
￮We face competition in all our businesses. We seek to differentiate our services and products, though many of our products are competing in 
commodity-type markets. Accordingly, a failure to manage our costs and our operational performance could result in a material adverse effect 
on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. We also compete with state-owned hydrocarbon entities and state-backed utility entities 
with access to financial resources and local markets. Such entities could be motivated by political or other factors in making their business 
decisions and may not require competitive returns. Accordingly, when bidding on new leases or projects, we could find ourselves at a 
competitive disadvantage or unable to obtain competitive returns.
Technology risks:
￮Technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to help meet the world's energy demands competitively. If we fail to effectively develop 
and/or deploy new technology, products and solutions, there could be a material adverse effect on the delivery of our strategy. We operate 
in environments where advanced technologies are used. In developing new technologies, products and solutions, unknown or unforeseeable 
technological failures or environmental and health effects could harm our reputation and licence to operate or expose us to litigation or 
sanctions. The associated costs of new technology are sometimes underestimated. We have faced delays in developing new technology in the 
past, and such delays could happen again in the future. If we are unable to develop our technology and products in a timely and cost-effective 
manner, we may fail to realise commercially viable products.

Delivery of capital projects and our ability to replace proved oil and gas reserves:
￮ We face numerous challenges in developing capital projects, especially those which are integrated. Challenges include: uncertain geology; 
frontier conditions; drilling at significant depths, the existence and availability of necessary technology and engineering resources; supply chain 
constraints; the availability of skilled labour; the existence of transport infrastructure; the expiration of licences; project delays, including delays 
in obtaining required permits; potential cost overruns; and technical, fiscal, regulatory, political and other conditions. We may fail to assess or 
manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles have impaired, and could in the future impair, our delivery of these projects, 
our ability to realise the full potential value of the project as assessed when the investment was approved, and our ability to fulfil related 
contractual commitments. This has led, and could in the future lead, to impairments. 
￮ Our future oil and gas production depends on our access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other 
owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, and through developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields. 
A failure to replace proved reserves would result in an accelerated decrease of future production.

[D] On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of its Nigerian onshore subsidiary The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) which holds a 30% interest in the 
SPDC JV to Renaissance. As of December 31, 2024, Shell had proved reserves of 453 million boe in SPDC.
[E] Pursuant to Shell's 2017 agreement with Canadian Natural Resources Limited, its remaining mining interest and associated synthetic crude oil reserves will be swapped for an additional 10% 
interest in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest CCS project. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The associated proved 
reserves as of December 31, 2024 were 741 million barrels (of which 50% attributable to non-controlling interest).
[F] On December 5, 2024, Shell and Equinor ASA, announced the combination of their UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North Sea's 
biggest independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%) and 157 million boe (as of December 31, 2024) 
of Shell's proved reserves will be contributed to the new joint venture alongside proved reserves contributed by Equinor. Subsequently, Shell will report 50% of the proved reserves of the new 
joint venture as part of Shell's share of proved reserves from joint ventures and associates.
￮ The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, 
contractual and economic information. Estimates can change over time because of new information from production or drilling activities, 
changes in economic factors, such as oil and gas prices, alterations in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. Estimates 
also change to reflect acquisitions, divestments, new discoveries, extensions of existing fields and mines, and improved recovery techniques. 
Published proved oil and gas reserves estimates could also be subject to correction because of errors in the application of rules and changes 
in regulatory guidance. Downward adjustments could indicate lower future production volumes and could also lead to impairment of assets. 
Joint arrangements:
￮When we are not the operator, we have less influence and control over the behaviour, performance and operating costs of joint arrangements 
or associates. Despite having less control, we could still be exposed to the risks associated with these operations, including environmental, 
reputational, legal (where joint and several liability could apply) and government sanction risks. For example, our partners or members of a joint 
arrangement or an associate (particularly local partners in developing countries) may be unable to meet their financial or other obligations to 
projects, threatening the viability of a given project. Where we are the operator of a joint arrangement, the other partner(s) could still be able 
to veto or block certain decisions, which could be detrimental to the joint arrangement. 
If any of the risks above materialise, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
How this risk is managed
￮ We maintain a diversified portfolio to manage the impact of macroeconomic volatility. We prepare an annual financial plan that tests different 
scenarios, and their impact on prices, on our businesses and organisation as a whole. These scenarios help us determine which issues could 
affect our operating environment and have implications for our strategy. They also help us to identify potential interventions to preserve our 
cash levels. 
￮ We continually assess the external environment -- the markets and the underlying economic, political, social and environmental drivers that 
shape them -- to evaluate changes in competitive forces. We define multiple potential future scenarios and business environments by identifying 
drivers, uncertainties, enablers and constraints to our competitiveness. 
Strategic Report | Risk management and risk factors continued
136 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 139 ----
￮ We also continually screen for new opportunities globally through our opportunity identification process. We test the resilience of our 
opportunities against a range of prices and costs for crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. These tests are based on short-, medium- 
and long-term market drivers, such as the extent and pace of the energy transition. Our opportunities are then ranked, prioritised and tested for 
strategic fit and value return expectations before being included in our growth funnel. We use our integrated exploration, development and 
project commercial and technical expertise to mature these opportunities and actively manage non-technical risks. We benchmark our projects 
internally and externally to make sure our proposals are competitive. We review the maturation progress of our various opportunities and 
perform post-investment reviews to extract learnings for implementation in future opportunities. 
￮ Shell's Projects & Technology organisation and our businesses work together to determine the content, scope and budget for developing new 
technology that supports our activities. This includes partnering with start-ups and small- to medium-sized enterprises that are in the early stages 
of developing new technologies through our Shell Ventures and Shell GameChanger programme. New technology is developed using a 
maturation process, to systematically mitigate technical and commercial risks, while staying aligned with Shell's strategic ambitions and 
deployment commitments. 
￮ A central group of reserves experts undertakes the primary assurance of the proved reserves bookings. A multidisciplinary committee reviews 
and endorses all major proved reserves bookings. Shell's Audit and Risk Committee reviews all proved reserves bookings and our CEO provides 
final approval. Our Internal Audit and Investigations function also provides further assurance through audits of the control framework, from 
which information disclosed in "Supplementary information – oil and gas (unaudited)" is obtained. 
￮ For every major project and operation where we share control, or where we do not have control or do not operate, Shell appoints a Shell 
Shareholder representative, whose responsibility is to manage performance, create and protect value for Shell. The representative seeks to 
influence operators and other partners to adapt their practices in order to drive value appropriately and to mitigate identified risks. We perform 
regular risk assessments of our joint ventures, including how our joint ventures' standards align with those of Shell and seek to influence to close 
any gaps identified. 
See "Market overview" on pages 28-30, "Other central activities" on pages 74-75, "Oil and gas information" on pages 47-54 and "Supplementary information - oil and gas (unaudited)" on 
pages 313-332.
2. Climate change and the energy transition Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
Rising concerns about climate change and the effects of the energy transition pose multiple risks to Shell, including 
declines in the demand for and prices of our products, commercial risks from growing our low-carbon business, 
and adverse litigation and regulatory developments. The physical impacts of climate change could also adversely 
affect our assets and supply chains.
Risk description
Societal demand for urgent action on climate change has increased, especially since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C in 2018 effectively made the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global 
average temperature this century to 1.5°C the default target for the parties to the agreement. Society's increasing focus on climate change 
and drive for an energy transition is contributing to a rapidly changing risk environment and a wide range of stakeholder actions against our 
organisation. The risks and impacts include the following:
Commercial risks: 
￮ Changing customer sentiment favouring the use of renewable and sustainable energy products may reduce demand for our oil and gas 
products. An excess of fossil fuel supply over demand could in the future result in reduced fossil fuel prices. This could result in lower earnings, 
cancelled projects and the potential impairment of certain assets.
￮ If we fail to stay in step with the pace and extent of change or customers' and other stakeholders' demand for low-carbon products, this could 
adversely affect our reputation and future earnings. If we move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or low-
carbon products for which there may be insufficient demand. Therefore, we cannot transition too quickly, or we may offer products that 
customers do not want. If we are slower than society, customers may prefer a different supplier, which would reduce demand for our products 
adversely affecting our reputation and materially affect our financial results. 
￮ Low-carbon technology and innovation are essential to our efforts to help meet the world's energy demands competitively. If we are unable to 
develop the right technologies and products in a timely and cost-effective manner, there could be an adverse effect on our future earnings. The 
operating margins for our low-carbon products and services have been, and could be in the future, lower than the margins we have experienced 
historically in our oil and gas operations. 
￮ Certain investors have decided to divest their interest in fossil fuel companies and, if this were in to increase significantly, this could have a 
material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets. Some financial institutions have been aligning 
their portfolios to low-carbon and net-zero opportunities, driven by both regulatory and broader stakeholder pressures. A failure to decarbonise 
our business portfolios in line with investor and lender expectations could have a material adverse effect on our ability to access financing for 
certain types of projects. This could also adversely affect our partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt.
Regulatory risks: 
￮The transition to a low-carbon economy has increased, and is likely to continue to increase the cost of compliance for our assets and/or products. 
Shell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. Governments may set 
regulatory frameworks in the future that could further restrict our exploration and production of hydrocarbons and introduce controls to limit the use 
of such products, which could also affect the timing and standards associated with the decommissioning of our exploration assets. 
￮ The lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around how carbon pricing and other 
regulatory mechanisms will be implemented in the future. This makes it harder to determine the appropriate assumptions to be taken into 
account in our financial planning and investment decision processes which could impair our ability to evaluate the robustness of our plans 
and opportunities. Changing net-zero policies and regulations could also lead to impairments of our existing oil and gas assets.

Societal risks, including litigation:
￮ In some countries, governments, regulators, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold fossil fuel 
companies liable for costs associated with climate change. If successful, these claims may have wide-ranging consequences, including forcing 
entities to hand over strategic autonomy in part to regulators, or to divest from hydrocarbon assets and technologies. We have also been subjected 
to climate activism that has caused disruptions to our operations and such disruptions could happen again in the future. Climate change lawsuits 
that have been filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our reputation. In the Netherlands, in a case against Shell brought by 
a group of environmental NGOs and individual claimants (referred to herein as "Milieudefensie"), the Hague District Court in 2021 found that while 
Shell was not acting unlawfully, Shell had the obligation to reduce the aggregate annual volume of CO2 emissions of Shell operations and energy-
carrying products sold across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 45% (net) by the end of 2030 relative to its 2019 emissions levels. For Scope 2 and 3, this was 
a significant best-efforts obligation. Shell appealed that ruling. On November 12, 2024, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld Shell's appeal and 
dismissed the claim against Shell. In doing so, the Court of Appeal annulled the earlier judgment of the District Court in its entirety with immediate 
effect. On February 11, 2025, Milieudefensie filed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. 
￮ Societal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and 
minimising damage to the environment. There is a focus on the role of the oil and gas sector in the context of climate change and the energy 
transition. This has negatively affected, and in the future could negatively affect, our brand and reputation, which could limit our ability to deliver 
our strategy, reduce consumer demand for our products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and restrict our ability to 
access capital markets or attract employees. 
Physical risks: 
￮The physical effects of climate change, such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature, sea levels and fluctuations in water availability, 
could also adversely affect our assets, operations, supply chains, employees and markets. 
In summary, rising climate change concerns, the pace at which we decarbonise our operations relative to society and effects of the energy transition 
pose multiple challenges to our business. These could result in, for example, increased costs, financial penalties, payments of financial damages in the 
event of losses of lawsuits, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets, and adverse impacts on our supply chains and licence to 
operate. Individually or collectively, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
How this risk is managed
Overall, we mitigate climate-related risks through our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. This approach includes: 
￮ reducing the GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by improving our energy efficiency, deploying renewable electricity, 
and reducing methane emissions in our assets and projects;
￮ growing our LNG business while decarbonising our LNG portfolio in two main ways: by growing our portfolio with a lower carbon intensity, 
and continuing to invest in emissions abatement projects to reduce both CO₂ and methane emissions;
￮ managing our Integrated Gas and Upstream portfolio to support a balanced energy transition by cutting emissions from oil and gas production. 
Oil production is increasingly from our deep-water business which, through innovation, produces higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels; and
￮ focusing our businesses in Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions to offer more low-carbon energy solutions, while reducing sales 
of oil products.
Our investments in low-carbon solutions are subject to financial modelling and stress-testing, due diligence and risk assessments to ensure that 
our capital is allocated to the most attractive low-carbon projects and opportunities. 
We adapt our assets and activities as necessary to enhance our resilience to the physical risks related to climate change. Many of these 
adaptations are based on our Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) standards and practices. 
We also engage with governments on their climate policies to advocate policies that help establish regulatory frameworks to enable society 
to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.
See "Our journey to net zero" on pages 76-108, "Energy Transition Strategy" on pages 77-92, "Renewables and energy solutions" on pages 68-71, Note 32 "Legal proceedings and other 
contingencies" on pages 308-310 and Note 4 "Climate change and energy transition" on pages 255-265.
3. Country risks Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
We operate in more than 70 countries which have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This has 
exposed, and could expose, us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual 
terms, laws and regulations. We also face various risks from the business and operating environment in Nigeria 
which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Risk description
Developments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our supply chains and operations. Potential impacts, which we have experienced 
in the past, include: forced divestment of assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of contract rights; delay of new 
projects; additional tariffs and taxes, including windfall taxes (especially during periods of prolonged high oil and gas prices experienced in 
recent years, such as 2022); restrictions on deductions and retroactive tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price 
controls; local content requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and 
enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Many parts of the world are facing economic and fiscal challenges and growing pressure 
on cost-of-living standards. These issues impact our business as governments, in response to political and social pressures, pursue policies that 
could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
The world is also facing continued geopolitical instability, including the Russia-Ukraine war, which impacts market conditions and our operations. The 
broader consequences of the ongoing crisis in the Middle East remain uncertain, and a wider escalation could have greater impacts on our operations 
in the region and beyond.

138 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 141 ----
We also face risks and adverse conditions in our Nigerian operations. These include security incidents affecting the safety of our people, host 
communities and operations; sabotage and crude theft; ongoing litigation; limited infrastructure; challenges presented by delayed government 
and partner funding and budget delays; and regional instability created by militant activities. Some of these risks and adverse conditions, such 
as security issues affecting the safety of our people, sabotage and theft, have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future.
Such developments and outcomes have had, and could have in the future, a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
How this risk is managed
￮ We continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests. Our Corporate Relations function liaises with 
governments and other external stakeholders in countries where we operate to understand and engage on local policies and to advocate 
Shell's position on topics relevant to our industry. We are prepared to exit a country if we believe we can no longer operate there in 
accordance with our standards and applicable law, and we have done so in the past. 
￮ With regard to the crisis in the Middle East, we have made adjustments to our operations in the region to reduce our exposure and we continue 
to monitor the risk of wider escalation. 
￮ When we participate in joint ventures in Nigeria, we require that they operate in accordance with good industry practice. We seek to 
proportionally share risks and funding commitments with joint-venture partners. We monitor the security situation, and liaise with host communities, 
governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote peaceful and safe operations. As a result of the March 13, 2025 completion of 
the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company, our exposure to these risks arising from onshore activities is expected to reduce. Shell has 
other businesses in Nigeria that are outside the scope of the announced divestment transaction.
See "Upstream" on pages 38-46. 
4. Financial risks Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
We are exposed to treasury risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. 
We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment and the conditions of financial markets. These, and 
changes to certain demographic factors, also impact our pension assets and liabilities. 
Risk description
We are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world. Political or economic instability affects such markets.
We use debt instruments, such as bonds and commercial paper, to raise significant amounts of capital. Should access to debt markets become more 
challenging, the impact on our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, some financial institutions have started 
to limit their exposure to fossil fuel projects. Group financing costs could also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations or any credit rating 
deterioration.
We are exposed to changes in currency values and to exchange controls as a result of our substantial international operations. Our reporting 
currency is the US dollar, although, to a significant extent, we also hold assets and are exposed to liabilities in other currencies. While we 
undertake some foreign exchange hedging, we do not do so for all our activities. Even where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected.
We are also exposed to financial losses from credit risk. Some of our counterparties have, from time to time, not met their payment and/or 
performance obligations under contractual arrangements and this could happen in the future.
We operate a number of defined benefit pension plans with significant associated liabilities. Volatility in capital markets or changes to government 
policies could affect inflation, interest rates and investment performance, causing significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. 
Changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement could also cause significant changes to the 
funding level of future liabilities. In the case of a funding shortfall, we could be required to make substantial cash contributions (depending on 
the applicable local regulations).
If any of the above risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
How this risk is managed
￮ We use various financial instruments for managing exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Our treasury operations are 
highly centralised and seek to manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. 
￮ Our portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. Other than in 
exceptional cases, the use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have the 
appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems. 
￮ We maintain a committed credit facility. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn 
committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.
￮ We have counterparty credit risk policies in place which seek to ensure that products are sold to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. 
These policies include detailed credit analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits. Where appropriate, netting 
arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk.
￮ A pensions forum chaired by the CFO oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in 
reviewing the results of assurance processes with respect to pension risk. Local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans and 
set the strategic asset allocation for the plans, including the extent to which currency, interest rate and inflation risks are hedged, and the 
contributions paid are based on independent actuarial valuations that align with applicable local regulations. Pension fund liquidity is managed 
by holding appropriate liquid assets and maintaining credit facilities. Where appropriate, transactions to transfer pension liabilities to third 
parties are also considered. 
See "Liquidity and capital resources" on pages 24-27 and Note 24 "Retirement benefits" on page 290.

5. Trading risks Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
We are exposed to market, regulatory and conduct risks in our trading operations.
Risk description
Commodity trading is an important component of our business which involves processing, managing and monitoring many transactions across 
different countries, exposing us to operational risks, market risks including commodity price risk, regulatory and conduct risks. We use physical and 
financial instruments, including derivatives such as futures and options to hedge market risks. It is not possible to eliminate all market risks we are 
exposed to. Therefore, our hedging has occasionally not performed as expected and may not do so in the future. We utilise commodity trading to 
optimise commercial margins from market price movements. Consequently, this activity could expose us to the risk of incurring significant losses if 
prices develop unfavourably. 
Our commodity trading entities are subject to many regulations, including requirements for standards of conduct. Due to the high volume of trades 
we execute, commodity trading gives rise to the risk of ineffective controls, failure in oversight of trading activities and a risk that traders could 
deliberately operate outside our internal operating limits. These risks have materialised in the past, and could materialise in the future, resulting in 
financial losses. The rapidly changing regulatory environment also creates a risk of insufficient, delayed or incorrect implementation of new 
regulatory requirements or changes to existing regulatory requirements. Violations of such regulatory requirements could expose us and our 
employees to regulatory fines. 
If any of the above risks materialise, it could harm our reputation and licence to operate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, 
cash flows and financial condition. 
How this risk is managed
￮ We operate with procedures and policies designed to ensure that trading risks are managed within a prescribed control framework. The 
framework sets out authorised limits and requirements that trading should only be performed by employees with the appropriate skills and 
experience. Senior management regularly reviews these authorised trading limits. In addition, a department that is independent from our 
traders monitors our market risk exposures daily, using techniques such as value-at-risk alongside other risk metrics.
￮ We maintain a Trading Compliance function managed by a Chief Compliance Officer, as regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, 
the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the Securities Commission of The Bahamas, with adequate resources, including 
employees and a budget; a comprehensive governance structure, controls, policies and procedures and established reporting lines. Shell's 
Trading Compliance function has systems for trade surveillance and monitoring communication, in addition to a dedicated conduct and 
ethics investigation function to assess breaches of non-compliance and thematic trends.
￮ Employees in Shell's trading organisation receive clear guidance through the Code of Conduct; the organisation's Trading and Supply 
Compliance Manual, supplemented with specific policies; a specific compliance website; mandatory training modules where completion 
is monitored; and other relevant training. 
￮ Shell leaders reinforce the importance of managing compliance and conduct risk in the trading organisation through monitoring risk metrics, 
reporting to compliance risk management and governance committees, setting clear expectations via townhall meetings and other channels, 
and enforcing consequences for non-compliance.
See "Liquidity and capital resources" on pages 24-27 and "Living by our values" on page 125-126.
6. Health, safety, security and the environment Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
The nature of our operations exposes us, and the communities in which we work, to a wide range of health, safety, 
security and environment risks.
Risk description
The health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) risks to which we and the communities in which we work are potentially exposed cover a 
wide spectrum, given the geographical range, operational diversity and technical complexity of our operations. These risks include the effects 
of safety lapses, natural disasters (including weather events and earthquakes) and pandemic diseases. If a major safety risk materialises, such 
as an explosion or hydrocarbon leak or spill, which we have experienced in the past, this could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm 
(including biodiversity loss), disruption of business activities, loss or suspension of permits, loss of our licence to operate and loss of our ability 
to bid on mineral rights. 
Social instability, criminality, civil unrest, terrorism, cyber disruption and acts of war have also negatively impacted, and could negatively impact, 
our operations, our assets, our employees and contractors, and the communities in which we operate. Risks which have materialised in the past 
include: acts of terrorism; acts of criminality, including maritime criminality and piracy; crude oil theft, illegal oil refining, sabotage of pipelines and 
militant activities in Nigeria; cyber espionage or disruptive cybersecurity attacks; conflicts and civil unrest; malicious acts carried out by individuals 
within Shell, such as data exfiltration; and environmental and climate activism (including disruptions by NGOs especially in the USA and north-
west Europe). For example, activists have boarded and protested on our vessels, assets and work sites, such as the Penguins floating production 
and storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel in 2023.
Financial losses and remediation costs from safety and environmental incidents are partially, but not fully, covered by our Group insurance 
companies (wholly owned subsidiaries) or third-party insurers. Accordingly, in the event of a significant incident, we may have to meet our 
obligations without access to proceeds from third-party insurers. We have in the past incurred adverse impacts and costs from events, such 
as Hurricane Ida in 2021. 
Strategic Report | Risk management and risk factors continued
140 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 143 ----
Our operations are subject to extensive HSSE regulatory requirements that often change and are expected to become more stringent over time, 
particularly in the areas of environment. Governments could require operators to adjust their future production plans, affecting production and 
costs. We have incurred, and could incur, significant extra costs in the future because of the need to comply with such requirements. Due to past 
violations of laws and regulations, and other regulatory obligations, we have incurred significant costs such as fines, penalties, clean-up costs 
(including decommissioning and restoration costs) and costs associated with third-party claims. We also face the risk of increasing costs from 
changes in regulations and technical standards relating to decommissioning and restoration.
The above risks have threatened, and can threaten, the safe operation of our assets and the transport of our products. They have harmed, and 
can harm, the well-being of our people, inflict loss of life and injuries, and disrupt our operational activities. They can also damage the environment 
and negatively impact our reputation.
If a significant HSSE risk materialises, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. 
How this risk is managed 
￮ We follow requirements set out in our SEAM Standards to develop suitable governance structures and mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring 
that if an HSSE risk materialises, we avoid the worst possible consequences and have ways to remediate any environmental damage. For 
example, our standards describe the key controls required to ensure safe production and equipment care; and the type of skills and training 
that are required for relevant employees. We routinely practise our emergency response plans for potential events, such as spills or fire. 
￮ Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every asset or operation. We aim to close and dispose of installations in a safe, efficient, 
cost effective and environmentally responsible manner while meeting regulatory requirements. This includes restoring the surroundings of these 
installations in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account. We seek to reuse, repurpose and 
recycle materials in decommissioning. Current and non-current decommissioning and other provisions are accounted for on our balance sheet.
￮ When planning projects, we conduct impact assessments, which help us to identify and assess a project's potential impact on the environment, 
people and communities. Once identified, we apply a mitigation hierarchy, which is a sequence of actions to manage potential impacts and 
risks. For example, in a biodiversity context we seek to avoid, minimise, restore and offset. 
￮ Our security risk mitigations follow the principles of "deter, detect, delay and respond". We strengthen the security of our assets, people and 
operations to reduce our exposure as appropriate, for example, by conducting site security risk assessments, using journey management plans and 
performing travel risk assessments. We also invest in information risk management capabilities and crisis management and business continuity measures.
￮ Our insurance companies are adequately capitalised and they may transfer risks to third-party insurers where economical, effective and 
relevant.
See "Safety" on pages 122-124, "Our approach to sustainability" on pages 127-133, "Corporate" on pages 72-73 and Note 32 "Legal proceedings and other contingencies" on pages 308-310.
7. Information technology and cybersecurity risks Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
We rely heavily on information technology systems in our operations.
Risk description
Shell operates a globally integrated model with a strong focus on digitalising business processes and an increasing dependence on information 
technology (IT) systems for our core operations, including for the management of personal data. As a result, we are heavily reliant on secure, 
affordable and resilient IT services provided both in-house and by third parties. Rapid advancements in digital technologies, including artificial 
intelligence (AI) and quantum computing, are ongoing. If we do not effectively harness these technologies, our business operations may become 
less efficient, and our product offerings could lose their competitive edge, ultimately hindering our ability to execute our strategy. 
Externally, we observe developments impacting our IT and cybersecurity risk profile: a worsening of the cybersecurity threat landscape 
represented by increasing volumes of sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, technology developments, geopolitical conflicts and increases 
in regulations across the markets in which Shell operates (such as the EU AI Act). As an organisation we have experienced, and expect to 
experience in the future, cybersecurity threats such as denial-of-service, ransomware, hacktivism and attacks from nation state actors that target 
critical energy infrastructure. We have also experienced and could in the future be exposed to non-malicious IT incidents. Across our supply chain, 
our suppliers, customers and business partners encounter similar cybersecurity threats and incidents. Cybersecurity incidents affecting us or our 
supply chain have impacted, and could impact, our operations, the security of our assets, the safety of our employees, and have a societal impact 
on the delivery and maintenance of critical energy infrastructure. Cybersecurity incidents frequently involve personal data breaches causing harm 
or potential harm to our customers, employees and stakeholders such as investors. In addition, such incidents have disrupted, and could disrupt, 
operations, cause reputational damage and possibly lead to significant regulatory fines. Cybersecurity incidents could therefore have a material 
adverse effect on our customers, staff and stakeholders thereby negatively affecting operations and our reputation. Accordingly, cyber security 
incidents could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.

141 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 144 ----
How this risk is managed
￮ Our Information and Digital Technology Standard sets out a structured approach to identify, assess and mitigate IT and cyber security risks. 
Our global integrated Information Risk Management (IRM) and cyber defence teams are staffed with cyber security professionals that monitor, 
assure and help defend our global IT and data landscape. As all our employees play a role in protecting our IT systems; we give them training 
on data protection, regulatory compliance and regularly run cyber security awareness campaigns and simulations on how to respond to cyber-
attacks.
￮ We evaluate emerging digital technologies with our businesses annually to align on their impact and necessary remediation, considering the 
value and opportunities they present, as well as their incremental risks.
￮ We continuously track cyber-attacks, threat intelligence, cyber legislation (including the EU AI Act) and vulnerabilities relevant to our IT 
landscape and have a well-structured incident management and escalation process in place.
￮ The security of IT services, where operated by external IT companies, is managed through contractual clauses and additionally through formal 
supplier assurance reports for critical IT services.
￮ With regard to the protection of personal data, we continue to invest in and maintain a mature and robust global data privacy compliance 
programme based on our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). Further details are explained in risk 8.
See "Other central activities" on pages 74-75. 
8. Litigation and regulatory compliance Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
Violations of laws carry fines and could expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits. We 
have faced, and could also face, the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide.
Risk description
We must comply with various laws. These include laws related to antitrust, competition, anti-bribery, tax evasion, anti-money laundering, trade 
compliance (including sanctions) and data privacy.
We have been fined in the past for violations of antitrust and competition laws, including fines by the EU Directorate-General for Competition (DG 
COMP). We have also, in the past, settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (FCPA). As a result, any future conviction of Shell or any of its operated joint arrangements or associates for violations of EU competition law or 
the FCPA could result in significantly larger fines and have a material adverse effect on us, including, but not limited to, damage to our reputation, 
resulting litigation, regulatory actions and criminal sanctions or penalties, and could potentially adversely affect our licence to operate. Violation of 
antitrust laws is a criminal offence in many countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. In certain circumstances, directors may receive 
director disqualification orders.
We are also subject to "trade compliance", the umbrella term that we use for various national and international laws designed to regulate the 
movement of items across national boundaries and restrict or prohibit trade, financial flows and other dealings with certain parties, countries and 
territories. For example, the EU, the UK and the USA continue to impose comprehensive sanctions on countries and territories such as Syria, North 
Korea and Crimea and other territories in Eastern Ukraine. The USA continues to have comprehensive sanctions against Iran and Cuba. The EU, 
the UK and some other nations such as Canada and Australia continue to maintain targeted sanctions against Iran. Countries around the world 
continue to impose sanctions and trade controls against Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Intergovernmental co-operation in this area 
has increased and there is growing pressure to enforce existing sanctions globally. Abiding by all the laws and regulations on trade compliance 
is often complex and challenging because of factors such as: the expansion of sanctions; the frequent addition of prohibited parties as other 
measures; the number of markets in which we operate; the risk of differences in how jurisdictions apply sanctions; and the large number of 
transactions we process. Shell has voluntarily self-disclosed potential violations of sanctions in the past. Any violation of sanctions could lead 
to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on, or prosecution of, Shell and/or its employees.
The protection and lawful use of personal data is of increasing importance to our licence to operate, given the significant increase in digital 
solutions provided to Shell's customers and business partners. We process personal data in all our operations. A failure to protect personal data 
or a failure to use it only for lawful and ethical purposes could result in significant harm to those individuals whose personal data we process. In 
addition, regulatory action by way of significant fines of up to 4% of Shell Group annual turnover and other enforcement actions such as orders 
to cease processing personal data may be imposed depending on the law in scope. There is a related risk of harm to our reputation potentially 
causing the loss of trust of existing and potential customers, stakeholders, regulators and employees. We have notified a number of data privacy 
regulators of personal data breaches and have had fines issued against us and this could happen in the future.
We also face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide. For example, Shell (in its capacity as previous owner of SPDC) and various subsidiaries and 
associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various environmental, non-environmental and contractual disputes brought in the courts of Nigeria, the 
USA and England. Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij B.V. (NAM), a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50%:50%) has also settled 
claims for physical damage to property caused by earthquakes induced by historical production from the Groningen gas field, and remains financially 
responsible insofar as the costs corresponded to NAM's liability. From time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and 
unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non‑compliance with policies and regulations could result in regulatory 
investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's opinion, exceeded their constitutional 
authority by attempting unilaterally to amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; failing to honour existing contractual commitments; and 
seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Certain governments have also adopted laws and regulations that could potentially conflict 
with other countries' laws and regulations, potentially subjecting us to criminal and civil sanctions. It is also now common for persons or corporations 
allegedly injured by violations of laws to sue for damages.

---- Page 145 ----
Violations of laws carry fines, which we have been subject to, and could be subject to in the future, and which could expose us and/or our 
employees to criminal sanctions, civil suits and other consequences, such as debarment and the revocation of licences. Accordingly, violation of 
laws, including those noted above, litigation and disputes could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, 
cash flows and financial condition. 
How this risk is managed
￮ Our Legal and Tax functions are organised globally and support our business lines in seeking to ensure compliance with local laws and fiscal 
regulations and proactively filing claims where warranted to protest unfair practices. 
￮ To help manage antitrust, competition, anti-bribery, tax evasion, anti-money laundering and trade compliance risks with adequate resources 
we maintain risk-based compliance programmes, a comprehensive governance structure, established reporting lines and policies and 
procedures, including mandatory due diligence, counterparty-screening and regular risk assessments. 
￮ Our employees receive guidance on the requirements listed in our Ethics and Compliance Manual -- including via a dedicated website, and 
training modules where completion is monitored -- which is reinforced by messages from Shell leaders on these requirements. This manual also 
includes the Protect Shell Policy, which explains Shell's position on managing antitrust risks in engagements with parties external to Shell. In 
response to fast-moving external antitrust developments and trends, internal guidance is continually being monitored to ensure that it remains 
relevant. 
￮ With regard to the protection of personal data, we continue to invest in and develop a mature and robust privacy compliance programme based 
on our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). Every Shell company is required to manage personal data in a professional, ethical and lawful manner. 
We have a robust "privacy by design" process, which includes the monitoring of data privacy regulations, to help ensure that necessary controls are 
built into our IT systems and solutions to protect personal data.
See "Living by our values" on pages 125-126 and Note 32 "Legal proceedings and other contingencies" on pages 308-310. 
9. Reputation and risks to our licence to operate Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, on our ability to secure new 
hydrocarbon or low-carbon opportunities, to access capital markets, and to attract and retain people, and on our 
licence to operate. 
Risk description
Our reputation is an important asset. Real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance or a perceived lack of understanding 
of how our operations affect surrounding communities and the environment could harm our reputation.
Societal expectations of companies are high, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and minimising 
negative impact on the environment and people, including human rights. There is ongoing focus on the role of oil and gas companies in the 
context of climate change and the energy transition. NGOs continue to challenge Shell's licence to operate through activities to block or delay 
projects and by bringing legal actions, diverting our resources and challenging trust. In key markets, we continue to see protests at external events 
such as our Annual General Meeting. We also continue to receive claims brought by NGOs. Our brand communications have been subject to 
challenge from advertising regulators in the UK and the Netherlands, following complaints received from members of the public. During prolonged 
periods of high oil and gas prices, the oil and gas industry has been accused in the past and could in the future be accused of profiteering from 
higher fuel and electricity prices and therefore impacting living costs. The materialisation of these risks has at times negatively affected, and could 
affect in the future, our brand, which could limit our ability to deliver our strategy; reduce consumer demand for our branded and non-branded 
products; harm our ability to secure new resources, partnerships and contracts; and restrict our ability to access capital markets or attract staff. 
Individually or collectively, these risks could negatively affect our reputation and licence to operate and, accordingly, could have a material 
adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.
How this risk is managed
￮ The Shell General Business Principles (SGBP) set out our responsibilities to shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and society. They 
set the standards for how we conduct business with integrity, care and respect for people. As part of these principles, we commit to contribute to 
sustainable development. All Shell employees and contractors, and those at the joint ventures we operate, are expected to behave in line with 
these principles. We undertake a range of activities to help embed the SGBP and the Code of Conduct throughout the organisation. This includes 
training and encouraging people to discuss the dilemmas they face in their work. Shell employees, contractors and third parties with whom Shell 
has a business relationship can report any potential breaches of the Code of Conduct confidentially through several channels, including 
anonymously through a global helpline operated by an independent provider. 
￮ We continually assess and monitor the external environment for potential risks to our reputation. We engage in dialogue with our key 
stakeholders, such as investors, industry and trade groups, academics, governments and non-governmental organisations to gain greater 
insights into societal expectations of the Shell Group. We make efforts to explain to our stakeholders what the Company is doing and why, 
the validity of our energy transition targets and our progress towards meeting them. 
￮ Human rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded in the Shell 
General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct.
￮ We take proactive steps when appropriate through legal means to protect our reputation from unwarranted accusations.

10. Our people and culture Risk type:   Strategic risk   Operational risk   Conduct and culture risk
The successful delivery of our strategy is dependent on our people and on a culture that aligns to our goals and 
reflects the changes we need to make as part of the energy transition. 
Risk description
Shell's culture is defined as the shared values, practices and beliefs of its employees. All these elements need to act in harmony to create our 
desired culture and ensure successful and sustained performance in line with our strategy. Our culture is influenced by decisions on organisational 
structure and accountabilities, people and skills, how work is done using processes and systems, and the mindset and behaviours that exist. 
As the energy system transforms and we reshape our portfolio, elements of our culture will need to adapt. For example, we will have to develop 
new skills, and adapt our processes and systems, which, in some areas, will need to be different from those required for our traditional oil and gas 
businesses. We will have to continually leverage our learner mindset to anticipate and respond to changes in the external market. However, we 
will also need to retain our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people to help ensure trust and openness in how we do business 
and help ensure our employees feel valued and perform at their best.
If we fail to maintain a culture that aligns with our strategy, this could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, 
cash flows and financial condition.
How this risk is managed
￮ The SGBP, Code of Conduct and Ethics and Compliance Manual help everyone at Shell act in line with our values.
￮ Delivery of our desired outcomes is pursued by leveraging our Performance Culture, i.e., the shared values, practices and beliefs of our 
employees. This is influenced by decisions on our structure and accountability; people and skills; processes and systems; and mindset and 
behaviours. Our mindset and behaviours emphasise psychological safety. 
￮ We have ambitions around diversity, equity and inclusion and monitor these on a regular basis. We also continually assess our culture and 
employee engagement through tools such as the annual Shell People Survey.
￮ People development remains a priority for our organisation. We proactively identify skill and capability gaps for traditional and emerging 
businesses; offer training to address these gaps; and if needed recruit talent externally to add to the skills and experiences of our workforce. 
To enable our leaders to lead this change, we support them through targeted interventions including leadership development and coaching.
See "Powering lives (People)" on pages 115-119 and "Living by our values" on pages 125-126.
Investors should also consider the following, which could limit shareholder remedies.
11. Other (generally applicable to an investment in securities)
The Company's Articles of Association determine the jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This could limit shareholder 
remedies. 
Risk description
Our Articles of Association generally require that all disputes between our shareholders in such capacity and the Company or our subsidiaries 
(or our Directors or former Directors), or between the Company and our Directors or former Directors, be exclusively resolved by arbitration in 
London, the United Kingdom. Our Articles of Association also provide that, if this provision were to be determined invalid or unenforceable for any 
reason, the dispute could only be brought before the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or 
other relief, including in respect of securities law claims, could be determined in accordance with these provisions.

Principal decisions and stakeholders 
Section 172(1) statement
The Board of Directors, having considered the matters set out in section 
172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006 (S172), confirm in good 
faith that the Directors have acted in a way that they consider would 
most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its 
members as a whole.
This S172 statement discloses how the Directors took into account the 
interests of Shell's wider stakeholders in the Board's decision-making 
process. The level of information disclosed is consistent with the size 
and the complexity of Shell's businesses and focuses on matters of 
strategic importance to Shell.
General confirmation of directors' duties 
Shell's Board has a clear and robust corporate governance framework, 
which sets out certain financial and strategic thresholds which need to 
be triggered for matters to be considered and approved by the Board. 
The corporate governance framework covers matters reserved for the 
Board, delegations to its committees and delegations to the Executive 
Directors. The Manual of Authority sets out the delegation and 
approval process across the broader business. 
All Directors, upon joining Shell, have participated in induction 
training and are provided with ongoing guidance covering the 
regulatory requirements of their role, including, but not limited to, S172.
When making decisions, each Director ensures that they act in the way 
they consider, in good faith, would most likely promote Shell's success 
for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so has regard 
(among other matters) to the issues set out below. 
(a) The likely 
consequences of 
any decision in 
the long term
The Directors understand the business and the evolving and challenging environment in which we operate, including the challenges of the 
global energy transition. In 2024, the Board continued with its oversight of Shell's strategy, including with respect to the Energy Transition 
Strategy 2024 (ETS24). The Board focused on financial strength and discipline with a dynamic approach to our portfolio of assets, with 
consideration given to key stakeholders and the likely long-term impact of any decision. During the year, the Board reiterated its commitment 
to Shell's energy transition strategy and reflected on the challenges to be faced by Shell in the next phase of this strategy, given the shifting 
macroeconomic and geopolitical context. We put customers at the centre of our strategy, innovating the products customers need as they 
seek to decarbonise. See pages 10-13 for more on our strategy.
The Directors recognise there are significant complexities in relation to Board decision-making, given differing societal and stakeholder views 
about our operations and the intricacies associated with the evolving energy transition. Accordingly, the Directors have considered S172 and 
made their decisions in good faith relating to Shell's strategy having regard for the long-term sustainable success of the Company. 
(b) Interests 
of employees
Shell employees are fundamental and core to our business model and the safe delivery of our strategic ambitions. The success of our 
business depends on attracting, retaining, developing and motivating talented employees. The Directors consider and assess the implications 
of relevant decisions on employees and the wider workforce. The Directors seek to ensure that Shell remains a responsible employer, 
including with respect to pay and benefits, fairness (including gender pay gap reporting, see pages 118), promotion of equal opportunity 
(information on Shell's diversity, equity and inclusion is detailed on page 117-119), health and safety issues, and the workplace environment. 
The Directors regularly engage with employees and the wider workforce (a summary of engagements is provided on pages 167-168), as well 
as consider the annual employee survey, the Shell People Survey (the most recent is detailed on page 117). The Directors recognise that our 
pensioners also remain important stakeholders.
(c) Fostering 
the company's 
business 
relationships 
with suppliers, 
customers and 
others
To deliver our strategy we require strong, mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, customers, governments, national oil companies and 
joint-venture partners. Shell seeks to promote and apply certain general principles in such relationships. The Board continues to review Shell's 
approach to suppliers, which is set out in the Shell Supplier Principles. In 2024, the Board reviewed steps taken with suppliers and supply 
chains to combat modern slavery and human trafficking. More detail on Shell's Modern Slavery Act Statement is set out on page 217. The 
businesses continually assess the priorities related to customers and those with whom we do business, with the Board engaging with the 
businesses on these topics, for example, within the context of business strategy updates and investment proposals.
The Directors also receive updates on a variety of topics that indicate how these stakeholders have been engaged. These updates include 
information provided by the Projects & Technology function on suppliers and joint-venture partners, with respect to items such as project 
updates and supplier contract management. Businesses also provide information, as relevant, on customers and joint-venture partners in 
relation to business strategies, projects and investment or divestment proposals. The CEO provides a comprehensive update to the Board 
on material business and external developments, including external engagements, at each main Board meeting. 
(d) Impact 
of operations 
on the 
community and 
environment
It is integral to our decision-making that we reflect on our impact on the community and the environment. To help it make decisions, the Board 
receives information on various topics including, for example, the net carbon intensity target, proposals to invest or divest, and business 
strategy reviews. The information also goes into Group-level overviews, such as updates on safety and environment performance, reports from 
the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, and reports from the Chief Internal Auditor. In 2024, the Board held meetings with Shell's in-country 
stakeholders, including a staff engagement during the Board's off-site in the Netherlands, which also included dialogue with Mark Rutte, who 
was Dutch prime minister at the time. Engaging with staff enabled the Board to maintain and strengthen its connection with Shell's businesses, 
workforce and other local stakeholders. It also provided the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Shell's reputation, role and 
contribution within the communities where we operate. See "Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders" on pages 165-166, 
and the Board committee reports.
(e) Maintaining 
a reputation for 
high standards 
of business 
conduct
Shell aims to meet the world's growing need for more and cleaner energy solutions in economically, environmentally and socially responsible 
ways. The Board periodically reviews and approves clear frameworks -- such as the Shell General Business Principles, Shell's Code of 
Conduct, specific Ethics and Compliance manuals, the Ethical Decision-Making Framework and the Modern Slavery Act Statement -- to ensure 
that high standards are maintained in Shell businesses and in Shell's business relationships. Complemented by the ways the Board is informed 
and monitors ethics and compliance with relevant governance standards, this helps to ensure that Board decisions and the actions of Shell 
companies both promote and maintain high standards of business conduct. 
(f) Acting fairly 
between 
members of 
the company
After weighing up all relevant factors, the Directors consider which course of action best enables delivery of our strategy in the long-term 
interests of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on stakeholders. In doing so, our Directors act fairly as between the Company's 
members but are not required to balance the Company's interests with those of other stakeholders.

Culture 
The Board plays an important role in establishing, assessing and 
monitoring our desired culture and how it is embedded in our values, 
attitudes and behaviours, including in our activities and stakeholder 
relationships. For example, the Board has established honesty, integrity 
and respect for people as Shell's core values. (For further information 
see "Living by our values" on pages 125-126). The Shell General 
Business Principles and Code of Conduct help everyone at Shell to act 
in line with these values and comply with relevant laws and regulations. 
The Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, Safety, Security, 
Environment & Social Performance applies across Shell and is designed 
to help protect people and the environment. (For further information, 
see "Safety" on pages 122-124). 
To achieve our strategic goals, we need to adapt our mindset and 
behaviours as we navigate the increasing complexity of the world 
around us. At Shell, we seek to have a culture that encourages 
the attitudes and behaviours we believe will help us succeed:
￮We deliver results: We own our performance, to power progress 
together. We deeply understand our business, we deliver the basics 
brilliantly, simplifying and improving every day. We are disciplined in 
meeting our promises even when the unexpected happens. Our 
values and care enable our competitive performance.
￮ We learn and adapt: we have the courage to raise the bar. With 
our Learner Mindset we navigate uncertainty and adapt in a rapidly 
changing world. We value and grow our expertise. We learn from 
setbacks to accelerate progress, knowing we have each other's back.
￮ We're one team: We win together, driven by our common outcomes. 
We listen to different views to make better data-based decisions and 
then we commit. We are the partner of choice by working together 
with our customers, communities and countries to consistently deliver 
our promises.
￮ We care: We care about each other, our work, our values, goal 
zero, ethics and DE&I. This builds trust, sets us apart and is key to 
our performance. Because we care, we are honest with each other 
to grow to be our best and deliver commercial outcomes. 
The Board considers the Shell People Survey to be an important tool 
for measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation, and 
commitment to Shell. With consistently high response rates, it provides 
valuable insights into employee views. It also helps the Board 
understand how the survey's outcomes are being used to strengthen 
Shell culture and values. 
Stakeholder engagement (including employee 
engagement) 
The Board recognises the important role Shell has in many societies 
and is deeply committed to public collaboration and stakeholder 
engagement. The Board strongly believes that Shell will only succeed 
by working together with customers, governments, business partners, 
investors, and other stakeholders. 
We continue to build on our long track record of working with others, 
such as investors, industry and trade groups, universities, governments, 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and, in some appropriate 
instances, our competitors through our joint-venture operations or 
industry bodies. We believe that working together and sharing 
knowledge and experience with others offers us greater insight into
our business. We also appreciate our long-term relationships with
our investors and acknowledge the positive impact of ongoing 
engagement and dialogue. 
The guidance on preparing information, proposals or discussion items 
for the Board asks for these materials to include considerations of the 
views, interests, and concerns of stakeholders and how management 
addressed them. This helps to strengthen the Board's knowledge of 
how the broader business undertakes significant levels of stakeholder 
engagement. The Terms of Reference for our Sustainability Committee 
(SUSCO) include, within the committee's remit: review and consider 
external stakeholder perspectives on sustainability issues of relevance 
to the Group's business, and review selected sustainability topics 
and matters of public concern, such as biodiversity, water and 
human rights.
The Board also engaged with certain stakeholders directly, to 
understand their views. The Board draws upon Shell's substantial in-
house expertise by periodically receiving input from economics and 
policy experts on key political and economic themes, with some 
updates being presented to the Board each quarter.
See "Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders" on pages 165-166.
Information on how the Directors have engaged with employees 
can be found on pages 167-168 and in the "Powering lives" section 
on page 117. The tables below include examples of how Directors 
have considered the interests of Shell employees and the resulting 
outcomes. 
Principal decisions
In this section, we outline some of the principal decisions made by the 
Board over the year. We explain how the Directors have engaged with 
or in relation to key stakeholder groups and how stakeholder interests 
were considered in decision-making. 
To remain concise, we have categorised our key stakeholders into 
seven groups. Where appropriate, each group is considered to include 
both current and potential stakeholders. The groups are: 
￮investor community; 
￮ employees/workforce/pensioners;
￮ our customers;
￮ regulators/governments; 
￮ NGOs/civil society stakeholders/academia/think tanks;
￮ communities; and
￮ suppliers/strategic partners.
Board decisions 
We define principal decisions taken by the Board as decisions taken
in 2024 that are of a strategic nature and significant to any of our key 
stakeholder groups. As outlined in the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(FRC) Guidance on the Strategic Report, we include decisions related 
to capital allocation and dividend policy. 
How were stakeholders considered 
We describe how regard was given to the likely long-term 
consequences of the decision, including how stakeholders were 
considered during the decision-making process. 
What was the outcome 
We describe which accommodations or mitigations were made, if any, 
and how Directors have considered different interests, and what factors 
they took into account.

Strategic updates 
Strategy
As part of the Board's continuing oversight of Shell's strategy, the Directors receive and 
discuss regular strategy updates including feedback from stakeholder engagements with 
management, investors, the media, climate activists and internal staff.
How stakeholders were considered
Energy Transition Progress and Strategy
In March 2024, the Board approved a report (the Shell Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24)) building on ETS21 which was created with the aim of helping investors and 
society obtain a better understanding of how Shell is addressing the risks and 
opportunities of the energy transition. ETS24 was put to shareholders for an advisory 
vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM), with 78.03% of shareholders that 
voted supporting the resolution.
Both before and after the 2024 AGM, the Chair, CEO and some members of the 
Executive Committee engaged with key stakeholders to understand their views and 
opinions on Shell's progress on its ETS. They engaged with our largest shareholders and 
offered further opportunities to discuss Shell's progress on its ETS and to understand the 
reasons behind various voting decisions. The Chair also engaged directly with our large 
institutional shareholders during his investor roadshow in September 2024.
What was the outcome
Energy Transition Progress and Strategy
There are differing views about Shell's ambition, targets and 
strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 
2050. Shell continued its dialogue with its stakeholders on the 
progress of its ETS, and the Board recognises the different views 
of each Shell stakeholder group. The Board continues to listen, 
learn and adapt as Shell delivers against its strategy, with 
consideration given to the long-term success of the organisation, 
as well as the interests of Shell's shareholders, customers and 
wider society. More information on the outcome of discussions 
following the 2024 shareholder advisory vote can be found 
on page 165.
Discussions with stakeholders and feedback from those 
engagements were integral to the preparation of ETS24, and 
the Board's approval of this strategy. In this Annual Report, we 
strive to provide information on Shell's progress on its energy 
transition strategy, along with our ambitions, targets and the 
clarifications our stakeholders are seeking.
Insights into Shell's operations in the Netherlands
In June 2024, the Board held its annual off-site in-person over the course of three days in the 
Netherlands, providing for a number of engaging and interactive events with both internal 
and external stakeholders. A summary of the Board off-site is provided on page 161. The key 
focus areas related to Shell's strategy and presence in the Netherlands.
Staff engagements
As part of the Board off-site, the Board and Executive Committee had the opportunity 
to engage and speak directly with staff about their experience within the Shell businesses 
in the Netherlands. For further information on the engagement with our workforce see 
"Board activities" and "Workforce engagement" on page 162 and pages 167-168. 
Board off-site
Through engagements with multiple stakeholders, the Board:
￮experienced the breadth of businesses that Shell has in the 
Netherlands;
￮ met with a diverse cross-section of staff and leaders in the 
Netherlands and considered their feedback from the 
engagements that took place;
￮ built awareness of the local context and risks;
￮ considered geopolitical contexts in connection with the energy 
transition;
￮ considered key external perspectives connected to Shell's 
energy transition ambitions, targets and strategy; and
￮ discussed core elements of our strategy with key customers, 
government officials and other stakeholders.
Financial strength, cash allocation including shareholder distributions
The Board considered cash flow, the macro environment and business performance in 2024 
against 2023. The Board also considered management's view of the outlook for the Group's 
performance, and reviewed the financial framework with specific focus on shareholder 
distributions. Directors approved several proposals with the aim of delivering value to 
shareholders and increasing shareholder distributions through a combination of progressive 
dividends and share buybacks.
How stakeholders were considered
A number of considerations underpinned each proposal, with proposals discussed and 
reviewed at certain points throughout the year. These considerations took account of the 
macro environment, robust business performance and outlook, the strength of the balance 
sheet, capital discipline, feedback from advisers and feedback from other stakeholders. 
What was the outcome
In relation to the decisions to increase distributions to 
shareholders, the Board and management considered the views 
of stakeholders, the strength of the Company's balance sheet 
and the need to continue to invest in the future of energy. 
The form, and timing, of distributions to shareholders were 
announced throughout 2024, alongside the publication 
of the quarterly results. 
During 2024, the Board approved share buybacks of $14 billion, 
and a further $3.5 billion of share buybacks was announced on 
January 30, 2025.
Approval of Shell's detailed Operating Plan 2025-2027 (OP24)
The approval of OP24 followed an in-depth review by the Board of proposals on capital 
allocation, capital investment outlook, competitive outlook, operating expenses, return on 
average capital employed, shareholder distributions and alignment with net carbon intensity 
targets. In the December 2024 Board meeting, OP24 was approved.
How stakeholders were considered
OP24 discussions included ensuring credible metrics, scenario testing and understanding the 
risks and levers to enable delivery of the near- and long-term targets which were set out at 
CMD23. Meeting commitments made to investors is critical to building trust and confidence 
with our external stakeholders. The Directors also considered the financial strength of the 
organisation, the macroeconomic environment, and the continued heightened geopolitical 
risks as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle East. The Directors and 
Executive Committee balanced the priorities in the financial framework, including capital 
and operating expenditure commitments towards the energy transition alongside increased 
shareholder distributions, maintaining balance sheet strength, aspired credit ratings and 
greenhouse gas target tracking. The plan was discussed extensively and reviewed 
thoroughly. Responses from investors and discussions with equity and debt market analysts 
were also presented to the Board for consideration. The Board asked management 
questions about the flexibility of OP24 in the event of various energy transition scenarios.
What was the outcome
Following extensive review and discussion, the overall 
outcome of this decision was an Operating Plan that the 
Board believes is robust against various scenarios and features 
strong optionality if needed. In particular, the Board assured 
itself that, as these decisions were taken, OP24 flexibly 
demonstrated pathways to enable delivery of Shell's near- 
and long-term targets.
We recognise that stakeholder opinions differ on the approach 
towards the energy transition. OP24 is based on society's 
demand for products and services. OP24 also supports Shell in 
maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct 
and health, safety, security and environment issues. It maintains 
the approach to employee remuneration and benefits to 
pensioners. OP24 also seeks to reward our investors with returns, 
a strong balance sheet and capital discipline, and to maintain the 
long-term financial strength of the Company to invest in more and 
cleaner energy and meet the current and future needs of society.

Over the course of the year, the Board considered and approved new opportunities 
and projects and proposed divestments or closures. 
How stakeholders were considered
The Board considered the impact of decisions related to new business opportunities and 
divesting from existing opportunities in the context of sustainability, supply, regulations and 
carbon intensity. Critically, the Board reviewed the alignment of various proposals with Shell's 
strategy. Particular focus was given to potential benefits of certain divestments, including their 
potential to: create returns for shareholders; further strengthen the balance sheet; de-risk 
future cash flow; and avoid significant additional capital investment. As part of the 
discussions, the Board considered the strategic drivers for the intended divestments, including 
the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of each asset, anticipated regulatory changes expected to lead 
to value erosion, and any value opportunities afforded by the macro environment. 
As part of each proposal, the respective business unit will undertake effective due 
diligence on prospective purchasers from a financial, reputational, as well as operating 
philosophy standpoint to ensure future obligations are met, or suitable mitigating 
measures are in place, to protect Shell and its people.
Within each divestment proposal, the Board considered if the Company was being a 
responsible seller of its assets and if the purchasers have the capability to manage our 
assets/people appropriately. Staff matters are explicitly considered during negotiations 
and the due diligence process for acquisitions and divestments. Comprehensive 
engagement plans are developed as appropriate in parallel to the negotiations.
As part of Shell's intercompany approval process, the following investments or 
divestments were discussed and supported by the Board.
Investment in Ruwais LNG
The investment in the Ruwais LNG project in Abu Dhabi taking a 10% equity interest.
Atapu Consortium final investment decision on Atapu-2 project in Brazil

Investment in Ruwais LNG project in Abu Dhabi
The Board approved the investment in the Abu Dhabi National 
Oil Company's (ADNOC) Ruwais liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
project in Abu Dhabi through a 10% participating interest. In

the position of minority shareholders, the relationship between 
Shell and ADNOC and the strategic fit for the project in 
delivering low carbon LNG.
Atapu Consortium final investment decision on 
Atapu-2 Project in Brazil's Pre-Salt
The Board approved the progression of the Atapu-2 project 
enabling the consortium to take a final investment decision. In 
Board discussions, the Board considered the strategic alignment 
and status of the project noting suppliers and supply chain 
constraints, contractor capacity and the position of the 
consortium partners.
Bonga North Investment
The Board approved the investment in Bonga North, a deep-
water project off the coast of Nigeria. In Board discussions, the 
Board considered among other things, the alignment of the 
opportunity with the strategy and the in-country stakeholders.
Project Manatee final investment decision
The Board approved investment in an undeveloped gas field in 
the East Coast Marine Area (ECMA) in Trinidad and Tobago. 
During Board discussions, the Board considered relations with 
the government in Trinidad and Tobago, customers, the carbon 
competitiveness of the project and geopolitical risk in the region 
and noted the project's alignment with the strategy.
Expansion of the CSPC petrochemical facility, China
The Board approved the proposed expansion of the CSPC 
petrochemicals facility enabling CSPC to take a final investment 
decision to build a third ethylene cracker and a new facility which 
will produce high-performance specialty chemicals. In Board 
discussions the Board noted the relations with government and 
the customer needs and the alignment of the investment with the 
strategic intent.
Creation of joint venture with Equinor for operations 
in the North Sea
The Board approved the execution of the commercial agreements 
with Equinor to progress the proposed joint venture. During Board 
discussions, the Board noted that the incorporated joint venture 
(IJV) will be set up to sustain UK oil and gas production and 
security of energy supply in the UK and considered the impact on 
staff, communities, government relations and other stakeholders.

Dear Shareholders
I am pleased to introduce this governance section of our 2024 Annual 
Report and Accounts. As a Board, we engage with Shell's purpose, 
strategy, vision, values and culture to fully understand how these all 
work together.
In 2024, I and my fellow Board members were especially impressed 
by how Shell's Executive Committee has focused on performance, 
discipline and simplification to transform Shell into a more competitive 
energy business.
We saw how this focus is rewarding shareholders and creating a 
simpler organisation. At the same time, Shell continues to provide its 
customers with the secure and affordable energy they need to power 
their lives and businesses today and through the transition to low-
carbon energy.
In line with Shell's transformation, on March 4, 2025, we announced 
further changes to Shell's Executive Committee (EC) and leadership 
structure to support its strategy to deliver more value with less 
emissions. These changes reflected Shell's three main areas of business 
value – Integrated Gas, Upstream, and Downstream, Renewables and 
Energy Solutions – and they follow the creation of a new Trading and 
Supply position in the EC.
Like the EC, the Board, in 2024, also took some important steps to 
drive more focus and simplification in the ways we work. For example, 
we have further integrated carbon management considerations at 
Board level; simplified the allocation of work between the Board, 
Board Committees and the EC; dedicated time to reflect on our 
dynamics and we will continue to look at how we can simplify 
our governance processes.
Shell has a strategy that is transforming its business, and a vision [A] 
to become the world's leading integrated energy company delivering 
impact at scale, connecting energy and people, matching supply to 
demand. The Board believes that this is the right approach for our 
customers, investors and wider society.
Energy Transition Strategy 2024
In March 2024, Shell published its Energy Transition Strategy 2024 
(ETS24) which was endorsed by shareholders at our Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) in May 2024. The Board was pleased to see this 
support for our Energy Transition Strategy which reduces emissions 
from our operations and our products as we work to become a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050.
Time was allocated to ETS24 at the annual Board off-site in June 2024, 
and the Board routinely discussed the energy transition at Board 
meetings throughout 2024. 
[A] A vision statement defines the desired future state of a company rather than a series of 
firm, binding commitments.
Board leadership and Shell's purpose
Shell's purpose is set out in the early pages of this report. Throughout 
this Governance report we focus on how Shell's governance operates 
in practice, and why we believe this is the best approach for us. 
The Governance report is structured around the key themes of the 
2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Our narrative 
seeks to explain how governance supports and protects Shell and 
our stakeholders.
Shell applies the principles and the spirit of the Code. There is one 
instance where we adopt an approach slightly different from that 
suggested by one of the Code's provisions, namely Provision 5 which 
concerns workforce engagement. We explain this on page 170. 
We consider our governance processes are appropriate, given the 
specific circumstances and range of factors particular to Shell, such 
as its global nature, size, complexity and history. 
Our AGM continues to reach a wider audience through its hybrid 
format, allowing our global shareholder base to participate in 
proceedings. However, disruptive and unsafe behaviour from 
some attendees requires us to continually assess how we conduct 
this meeting. 
Information on how the Board discharges its duty in relation to key 
stakeholder interests, including those of our workforce, and an 
explanation of how it considered these when making principal 
decisions are set out on pages 145-148. On pages 161-164, we 
provide information about our Board activities and highlight which 
stakeholders we considered.
I was delighted to visit a range of Shell sites with a number of Board 
members, including in Brazil, the Netherlands, Oman and Qatar. I also 
went to China where I delivered a lecture at Tsinghua University School 
of Economics and Management, and presented awards to the finalists 
of the Shell Eco-marathon.
Our workforce engagement methods can be found on pages 167-168. 
We continue to believe that constructive relationships built on mutual 
respect and transparency help Shell attract and retain employees, 
while supporting greater productivity and operational safety and 
efficiency. Helping ensure that employee voices are heard on relevant 
matters in the boardroom in practical ways is key to understanding 
the broader impact of business decisions, including with respect to 
organisational culture. 
The Board recognises the importance of culture in delivering Shell's 
purpose and strategy. In December 2024, the Board received updates 
on the Shell People Survey, an annual employee survey, and the 
conduct and culture within the organisation, along with the associated 
risk areas (see "Risk management and risk factors" on pages 134-144 
for more information on this risk).
Governance
Introduction
from the Chair
150 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 153 ----
In January 2025, the management team shared with us how it is 
seeking to evolve the Shell culture, placing people at the heart of 
transforming Shell's performance. Shell's culture reflects the long-held 
values of the organisation – honesty, integrity and respect for people. 
These underpin all the work we do and are embedded in our strategy 
and purpose. The Board will continue to increase its focus on Shell's 
culture to make sure it continues to align with the business strategy. 
Division of responsibilities
More information on how the Board and Board committees support 
business operations is provided on pages 159-160. In 2024, the Terms 
of Reference for the Board committees were reviewed and updated. 
The full Terms of Reference for each committee, and the Matters 
Reserved for the Board are provided on our website. Commitments 
of Directors are reviewed to help ensure they have sufficient time to 
fulfil their duties.
Composition, succession and evaluation
There were no changes to the Board in 2024. In 2024, Cyrus 
Taraporevala became a member of the Remuneration Committee. 
He will succeed Neil Carson as Chair of the Remuneration Committee 
following the 2025 AGM. 
The 2024 Board evaluation process comprised a Board Dynamics 
review, as well as an internally facilitated questionnaire-based Board 
and Committee evaluation. More on this can be found on pages 
169-170.
Audit, risk management and internal control
Throughout the year, the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) 
assisted the Board in implementing sound systems of risk 
management and internal control, oversight of Shell's financial 
reporting, and consideration of ethics and compliance matters. 
A variety of standing matters and more specific topics are 
discussed by the ARC throughout the year and more on this
can be found on pages 176-187.
Looking ahead
Our Capital Markets Day 2025 outlines how we intend to accelerate 
our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.
We are cognisant of and accept, that not all our stakeholders will be 
fully supportive of all the decisions that we take, and some stakeholders 
will choose different methods of communicating their views and their 
concerns. We will continue to engage with stakeholders, and we will 
continue to have the humility to listen, learn and adapt as we focus 
and frame our strategy for the long-term success of the Company. 
As always, as we work through the energy transition, there is more that 
needs to be done. Your Board is confident that the update presented 
at Capital Markets Day 2025 will help Shell to deliver on its promises 
to shareholders.

responsibilities and set these out in writing. These documents are available on request from the Company Secretary.

Board activities
Board activities
The Board works to a yearly meeting plan with corresponding agendas 
and reading materials, provided digitally in advance of meetings, 
to support the Board in its oversight of the Group's operations and 
management. Standing agenda items include reports from the CEO, 
the CFO and the Chair of each Board committee. Other updates 
throughout the year come from various businesses and key functions, 
including Investor Relations; Health and Safety, Security and 
Environment; Information Technology; Human Resources; and 
Legal, as well as the Company Secretary. The Board also considers 
and approves the quarterly, half-year and full-year financial results, 
shareholder distributions and the associated announcements, and, 
at most meetings, considers investment, divestment and/or financing 
proposals and tracks performance. Additionally, the Board reviews 
the Group's annual Operating Plan, including activities undertaken 
designed to meet the Group's carbon reduction targets. To enable 
purposeful discussion and focus on particular aspects of agenda 
topics, including the impact on key stakeholders, Directors have 
an opportunity to specify information they require to be provided 
in advance of Board meetings.
During the year, where possible, Non-executive Directors conduct site 
visits. The visits are designed to provide them with a deeper insight 
into certain business operations.
 
See "Understanding and Engaging with our Stakeholders" on pages 165-166 and in 
"Workforce Engagement" on pages 167-168.
Some of the activities and areas of Board focus over the year are 
summarised in the table below. The information in the table is not 
exhaustive. Information on other topics discussed by the Board and 
details of the resulting decisions are covered elsewhere, primarily in 
the Section 172 statement provided earlier in this report on pages 
145-148. In some cases, a brief outline has been provided below, 
and page references are provided for additional information.
Board off-site
Each June, the Board and Executive Committee participate in a three-
day programme, known as the "Board off-site", which takes place in a 
priority country setting and serves to improve Board effectiveness and 
strategic decision-making. The 2024 Board off-site was held in person 
in the Netherlands over three days. The event sought to deliver insights 
into business strategy and operations. It also incorporated a visit to one 
or more strategic assets and facilitated dialogue with the Netherlands 
country chair, employees, contractors, regional country chairs, and 
external stakeholders, including customers and suppliers.
The Netherlands is an important heartland for Shell. The Board and 
EC members conducted a deep dive into each of Shell's businesses

Understanding and engaging
with our stakeholders
The Board values and recognises the importance of engagement 
with our stakeholders. Time is dedicated to listening to different 
stakeholder views and our commitment to stakeholder engagement 
is built upon the understanding that knowledge-sharing, widening of 
experiences and adopting a learner mindset will help us achieve our 
commercial, environmental and social objectives. The Board remains 
grateful for the engagement opportunities it has had, including the 
2024 AGM. 
The Directors have continued to consider stakeholders' views in 
Board discussions and decision-making, as described on pages 
145-148. Engagement with our stakeholders also goes beyond the 
Board and is continuous. Our broader businesses regularly engage 
with stakeholders throughout the year, and in the build-up to or during 
many Shell projects, activities, acquisitions and divestments. This 
engagement is often governed by formulated policies, control 
frameworks, regulation and legislation. It may differ by region.
Site visits
The Chair, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors 
traditionally visit several Shell operations and overseas offices in 
a given calendar year. The objective of these visits is to provide the 
Directors with local context and deepen their understanding in the 
following ways, where relevant:
￮provide insights into asset operations and portfolio positions; 
￮ opportunity to engage directly with stakeholders, including staff, 
business partners, communities;
￮ improve the Board's oversight of top risks; and
￮ assess the Company's culture first-hand.
Visits provide a good opportunity for Board members to engage 
with each other. For further information in relation to site visits, 
see "Board Activities" on pages 161-164. 
Shareholders
The Chair, the Deputy Chair, the CEO, the CFO and the Executive 
Vice President Investor Relations and Strategic Planning each meet 
regularly with major shareholders and report the views of such 
shareholders to the Board. Committee chairs also seek engagement 
with shareholders on significant matters related to their areas of 
responsibility. During the year, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, in his capacity 
as Chair, met with more than 50 major shareholders, including during 
four days of roadshows. A variety of topics were discussed with the 
Chair, including performance, capital discipline and simplification of 
Shell; governance and Board priorities; and the Company's role in the 
energy transition. In the early part of the year, the REMCO Chair met 
with more than 25 shareholders and discussed 2023 pay outcomes 
and implementation of the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy 
for 2024 ahead of the 2024 AGM.
Shareholders can contact Shell directly via the "Contact us" section of 
the Shell website. This allows investors' questions to be directed to the 
appropriate Shell team that can assist. The Shell website also provides 
contact details for our Registrar, Equiniti, shareholder queries, our 
media team, requests for copies of the Annual Report, and general 
customer enquiries.
The Company's Registrar operates an internet access facility for 
registered shareholders, providing details of their shareholdings. 
Facilities are also provided for shareholders to lodge proxy 
appointments electronically. The Corporate Nominee service, 
facilitated by Equiniti, provides a facility for investors to hold 
their shares in the Company in paperless form.
Shareholder engagement on AGM resolutions
At the 2024 AGM, shareholders voted on two climate-related 
resolutions: (i) Resolution 22, which was an advisory vote on Shell's 
Energy Transition Update – shareholders showed strong endorsement, 
with 78% of shareholders who voted casting votes in favour; and (ii) 
Resolution 23, a shareholder resolution, submitted by an organisation 
called Follow This on behalf of a small group of shareholders. The 
resolution from Follow This was similar to their 2023 submission, which 
was also rejected by shareholders, as its variations have been every 
year since first being submitted in 2016. The resolution urged Shell to: 
"align its medium-term emissions reduction targets covering the 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the use of its energy products 
(Scope 3) with the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement: to limit global 
warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue 
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°". We remain committed 
to constructive engagement with our shareholders, and we believe our 
climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris 
Agreement. The Board did not consider the proposal from Follow This 
to be in the best interest of the Company, its shareholders as a whole, 
its customers, and the climate. Resolution 23 received support from 
19% of shareholders who voted. Shell is aware that some shareholders 
voted in support of both Resolutions 22 and 23, despite their 
conflicting content.
In 2024, the Chair, CEO and CFO hosted meetings with some of 
our large shareholders. These meetings covered many topics. We 
recognise and value the importance of stakeholder engagement when 
considering our energy transition progress. The Board is grateful for the 
time and contribution of all those stakeholders who provided feedback, 
and for the overall indications of support for Shell's strategy. 
Following the AGM, we engaged with our largest shareholders offering 
further opportunities to discuss Shell's energy transition strategy and to 
understand the reasons behind various voting decisions. The Chair 
subsequently had an opportunity to engage directly with our large 
institutional shareholders during his roadshow in September 2024.
These discussions have highlighted that some shareholders have 
outlined societal pressure influencing media coverage and 
expectations from beneficial owners as reasons for not aligning with 
the Board recommendation. Others raised questions related to our 
intention to grow our LNG portfolio, using an LNG volumetric target 
as an energy transition indicator in the 2024 scorecard, the changes 
made to our Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets, and a new absolute 
Scope 3 ambition covering oil products.
This feedback was added to the ongoing internal considerations of 
the Company's climate targets and ambition, along with the outcome 
of the Milieudefensie Hague Court of Appeal hearing, Shell's strategy, 
progress since Capital Markets Day 2023, and the commitments that 
Shell had made within its energy transition strategy.

Engagements in 2024
Information on engagements the Board has held during the year is summarised below. Information on engagement with other stakeholders 
including the workforce is provided on pages 167-168. The way in which stakeholder interests were considered in principal decision-making 
by the Board in 2024 (Section 172 statement) can be found on pages 145-148. 
Remuneration roadshow – first-quarter 2024 engagement
Engagement was 
undertaken before the 
meetings so that the 
Directors were provided 
with understanding and 
insight on particular topics 
of interest.
In March 2024, Neil Carson, Chair of the REMCO, presented the 2023 
remuneration outcomes and 2024 remuneration plans to investors. 
The presentation included summaries on:
￮reflections on the Company's financial performance, portfolio, and 
strategic delivery;

￮ Implementation of the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy 
for 2024, including impact of ETS24; and
￮ forward-looking agenda. 
REMCO Chair Shareholders were provided with 
context and an explanation of the 
REMCO deliberations in arriving at 
the 2023 pay outcomes and setting 
the pay framework for 2024. They 
had the opportunity to ask questions 
and provide feedback. 
Annual ESG update 2024
Discussion with the Chair 
of the Board to ensure 
that key topics would 
be covered. 
This annual engagement took place in March 2024 in London with 
investors. It included an update on ESG matters of significance, including 
Shell's 2024 Energy Transition Strategy. 
CEO and CFO Any questions requiring follow-up 
were addressed outside the 
presentations. In some cases, 
follow-up meetings were held 
with stakeholders and the Chair 
of the Board.
2024 AGM
Directors engaged with 
investors ahead of the event 
on a number of matters, 
including those being voted 
on at the AGM.
As well as the Company giving a balanced report of results and progress 
at the AGM, shareholders had an opportunity to ask questions in person, 
via the digital AGM platform, telephone, or submit questions via the Q&A 
desk outside of the auditorium.
Board A number of additional engagements 
including follow-up meetings and 
answering of queries.
Chair roadshow
The Chair of the Board 
engaged with more than 50 
large institutional investors 
during two roadshows in 
April and September 2024. 
The Chair of the Board provided an update on the governance 
of Shell and gave key investors opportunities to ask questions. 
Key topics included governance, remuneration, energy transition 
and business outlook. 
Chair Provided the Chair with an 
opportunity to listen to key 
institutional shareholders and 
to provide Board perspective 
on topics such as governance, 
energy transition, business and 
management performance.
Director visits
Discussions were held with 
the respective Directors 
ahead of the visit to 
formulate the agenda 
and encourage a natural, 
open dialogue in the 
group sessions.
In June 2024, the Board and Executive Committee visited the 
Netherlands. More information on this visit can be found on page 161. 
Two additional Board visits took place in 2024: to Qatar and Oman in 
January and to Brazil in April. The Chair attended both trips and was 
accompanied by a sub-set of the Board including representatives of both 
the Audit and Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The visit 
programme focused on general Board-related matters plus areas of 
particular importance to both committees. The Chair also visited Brasilia, 
and met with the British Ambassador, Minister of Finance and Vice-
President of Brazil/Minister for Development, Industry and Trade.
In October, the Chair visited China to deliver an energy lecture to 
Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, to participate 
in the School of Economics and Management's Advisory Board, and to 
present to the finalists of the Shell Eco-marathon.
More information on these visits can be found on page 167. 
Directors The Board gained an insight into 
the development and culture of the 
operations and maintenance teams. 
The use and impact of digitalisation 
tools were highlighted, and the 
future environmental capabilities 
of the sites were discussed.

Workforce engagement
As with all the UK Corporate Governance Code's provisions, boards 
must consider the size and structure of their business, including its 
international scope, and select an approach to engaging with the 
workforce that most practically delivers the underlying spirit and 
ambition of the Code. 
The Code states that its use of the term "workforce" is not meant to 
align with legal definitions of workforce, employee, worker or similar 
terms. But for a global organisation bound by the laws of more than 
70 countries, blurring the clearly prescribed legal definitions that affect 
complex issues (such as local health, safety, security and environment 
(HSSE) requirements, work contract terms, legal accountability, 
employment rights) or merging two definitions of the same term 
could have a notable impact on the business, its operations and its 
stakeholder relationships (including with suppliers). As a result, Shell 
considers its workforce to be employees of companies in the Shell 
Group. The Board also engages with others outside this group (for 
example, on site visits), and some of this engagement is shared 
on page 165.
Although our reporting and formal engagement focuses predominantly 
on our employees, all individuals working on Shell sites (including Shell 
offices) are required to undertake certain Shell training (for example, 
on matters relating to HSSE and the Code of Conduct). Adhering to 
the Life-Saving Rules and the Code of Conduct compliance obligations 
is included within our contracts with suppliers. Shell employees, 
contractors and third parties with whom Shell has a business 
relationship can report any potential breaches of the Code of Conduct 
confidentially through several channels, including anonymously through 
a global helpline operated by an independent provider.
For many years, Shell has recognised the importance of engaging 
with its workforce. Engagement is especially important in maintaining 
strong business delivery in volatile times of change. We strive to 
maintain a dialogue between management and our workforce – 
both directly and, where appropriate, engagements take place 
with union and employee representatives at asset and country level, as 
well as with the Shell European Works Council. Management regularly 
engages with the workforce through elected employee representatives 
and a range of formal and informal channels. These channels include 
webcasts and all-employee messages from the Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) and other senior leaders, as well as town halls, team meetings, 
site visits by the Board and EC, internal social platforms and online 
publications via our intranet.
The Board considers effective engagement a key element of its 
understanding of the Company's ability to create value, because 
it recognises that our people are our greatest asset. Workforce 
views can help inform the Board on matters such as operational 
effectiveness, Shell culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, identifying 
risk and opportunity, and developing and delivering strategy. We 
believe these engagements enable Shell to maintain a constructive 
employee and industrial relations environment. 
The Board considers the current workforce engagement approach 
to be effective, and feedback from employees indicates that they 
too find the interactions valuable and worthwhile. The information 
provided in the following table gives examples of various methods 
of Board engagement.
 Board's direct engagements with the workforce
Informal engagement – Board
NOMCO members met with various senior leaders and high-potential 
individuals throughout the year. 
Off-site visits
Workforce engagements during Board and/or meetings off-site.
Meeting talent/leadership teams.
The Chair undertaking staff engagement sessions.
Through these more formal engagements, the Chair and other Non-executive 
Directors (either individually or in groups) have deepened their understanding 
of how the Company's purpose, strategy and values are embedded in particular 
businesses, sites and countries. This continues to give insight into progress made, 
risks and opportunities. The benefits are mutual. The Board obtains direct insight 
into local business operations and projects, and local strengths and challenges. 
Our people have a chance to better understand the Board and to provide direct 
feedback on topics of importance to them, their business or function and their 
location.
Shell Qatar
In Qatar, the group had discussions on how the business is optimising value 
through integration and efficiencies, followed by a visit to the Pearl GTL gas-to-
liquids plant and the LNG North Field Expansion Project. While the Chair 
participated in a staff engagement session, the rest of the group visited the 
Qatar Shell Research Centre. There was a dinner with the extended leadership 
team of Qatar Shell, and a lunch with the Minister for Energy and senior leaders 
in QatarEnergy. 
Shell Oman
In Oman, the programme entailed deep dives on business strategy, 
opportunities and risks, diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and social 
performance. It also incorporated a site visit to the Block 10 oil-producing field, 
a dinner with the Minister for Energy, and an informal evening with staff.
Shell Brazil
The Brazil programme started in Rio de Janeiro, home to Shell Brasil's head 
office and where the upstream business in-country operates from. Here the 
Board members engaged in a roundtable of approximately 10 senior external 
stakeholders including former senior government officials and thought leaders. 
While the Chair had a staff engagement session, other Board members met 
DE&I network leads. Board members then travelled to Sao Paolo to meet with 
leaders and staff of the Raízen biofuels joint venture for discussions on 
business opportunities and risks, the potential for biofuels in Brazil and 
globally, and sustainability considerations. 
The programme concluded with a visit to the Bomfim Advanced Biofuels and 
Renewable Natural Gas Plant and adjacent sugar-cane plantations to hear first-
hand about the agricultural activities, technology, challenges and opportunities. 
Shell Netherlands
The Board and Executive Committee (EC) visited the Netherlands over three 
days in June for their annual off-site visit and Board meeting. The visit provided 
significant opportunities for workforce engagement on our strategy and the 
energy transition.
Over the three days, the Board and EC engaged with the workforce in a range 
of different ways, including business briefings covering Shell's integrated value 
chain in north-west Europe, the mobility business in the Netherlands, the 
Upstream business in the Netherlands, and how Shell is applying digital 
innovation to support decision-making and deliver value. They had lunch with 60 
staff members from various functions, including those active in DE&I networks, 
and dinner with 24 members of the leadership team in the Netherlands. 
As referenced in our Board activities section on page 161, the Board and EC 
also visited the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam and the Holland 
Hydrogen I construction site. Here the Board and EC engaged in site 
interactions and lunch with staff at both sites. 
Shell China
In October 2024, the Chair visited China to deliver an energy lecture to 
Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, to participate in 
the School of Economics and Management's Advisory Board, and to present 
to the finalists of the Shell Eco-marathon, followed by dinner.

 Formal reports and information updates to the Board
Shell People Survey
Through the results of the Shell People Survey (an anonymous survey, facilitated 
externally), the Board was provided with an update on employee engagement 
levels, and the quality and resilience of leadership across Shell's workforce. The 
Board was informed of a broad range of subjects, including principal metrics, 
with particular focus on rewards, working conditions, workload and reputation.
The Board considers the Shell People Survey to be one of its key tools for 
measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to 
Shell. It provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high 
response rate. In 2024, the response rate was 86%, down 2% from 2023. The 
Board also considers this engagement to understand, for example, how Shell is 
using the survey outcomes in: i) data analytics, for example, to identify potential 
correlative relationships between employee engagement and safety or ethics 
and compliance incidents; and ii) strengthening Company culture and values. 
See also "Powering lives" section on page 117.
Senior Succession and Resourcing Review
The annual Senior Succession and Resourcing Review focused on the strength 
of senior leadership and plans for its development and succession, while 
highlighting the breadth, depth and diversity of its pipeline, the developing 
profile of the leadership cadre, and recruitment and attrition levels.
The Senior Succession and Resourcing Review also highlighted the effectiveness 
of succession planning, the impact of its associated execution, and the data-
driven, integrated approach to leadership and leadership development. The 
review continues to focus on proactive management of Shell's talent pipeline, 
and on advancing Shell's diversity agenda with increased attention on gender, 
race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disabilities.
Assessment of key trends and material incidents
Presented by the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. This is based on the 
established channels for staff and others to file complaints or report on 
suspected breaches in relation to the Shell General Business Principles (SGBP), 
the Code of Conduct or any breaches of laws or regulations, including 
accounting control and auditing concerns.
The assessment covers Shell employees and our wider stakeholder base. The 
Board (also via the ARC) obtains insight into incidents and reporting levels and 
remediation. These provide indicators of conduct risks and, together with the 
related Board reports noted below, suggest the strength of embedding and 
awareness of the Code of Conduct and SGBP obligations and employees' 
comfort levels in raising incidents.
Risks
The Board reviewed reports on Shell's top risks, external and internal trends 
and emerging risks.
Organisational culture
The Board has continued its discussion on the strategy, including powering 
lives. The Board also focused on diversity, equity and inclusion ambitions.
Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Report
Data and insights include information from the Global Helpline, the Shell 
Ethics and Compliance organisation and the Shell People Survey.
The ARC is kept updated when matters highlighted through the Global Helpline 
are investigated. The ARC is also informed about the associated remediation. 
See "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on page 176-187.
Assurance activities
Assurance activities, including items raised by businesses and functions 
(through the Group Assurance Letters process) and assurance (from Internal 
Audit, HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, Reserves Assurance and Reporting, 
Financial and Non-Financial Reporting), provide additional evidence to the 
Board of the commitment to high standards of risk management and internal 
control. The assurance activities ensure that work can be done safely, within 
regulatory frameworks.
The information provided within these reports further supports the Board's 
annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management 
and internal control, and feeds into the Group scorecard, against which staff 
bonuses are calculated.
The Shell Performance Framework
Significant HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, and more broadly, business control 
incidents are brought to the attention of senior management, the Board, and, 
as appropriate, the Board Committees, through regular reporting.
During these discussions, the Board seeks to learn more from incidents and 
ensure that the business continues to drive safety performance.

Board evaluation
Board review process
The 2024 Board evaluation process comprised:
(a) Board Dynamics review
The review, which took place in September 2024, was structured to 
reflect on the current state of Board practices, focusing on opportunities 
for the Board to further elevate its collective performance, noting where 
there are strengths as well as opportunities to develop. The review, 
supported by the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Company 
Secretary, involved one-to-one discussions between the Chair and each 
Non-executive Director as well as plenary discussions with the Board 
and Executive Committee. A number of key themes and focus areas 
were identified as part of the review, including: (i) preparing for the 
next phase of key strategic decision points for the Company; (ii) 
deepening the Board's relationship with non-Board members of the 
Executive Committee; (iii) balancing how the Board continues to best 
act as a collective, while recognising the strengths and diversity of 
individual members needed to maximise performance; and (iv) 
continuing to sharpen the onboarding process. A number of 
actions to address these findings are under way.
(b) Internally facilitated questionnaire-based Board and 
Committee evaluation
Taking into account the structure and output from the 2024 Board 
Dynamics review, it was recommended that NOMCO conduct an
in-house review (similar to the 2023 process). The form of the 
questionnaires were appropriately adjusted to reflect the output from 
the Board Dynamics review and Board members responded to those 
questionnaires, which were shared at the end of 2024, with results 
discussed at the January 2025 Board and committee meetings. 
Separate questionnaires were produced for the evaluation of the Chair, 
and the Board committees. In addition, the Chair held separate one-to-
one discussions with each of the Non-executive Directors to assess their 
individual performance during the year. To broaden the inputs into the 
evaluation process, members of the EC participated in the evaluation 
process, also completing questionnaires relating to their attendance 
at Board meetings. The Company Secretary produced a feedback 
summary providing recommendations to the Directors. This report was 
shared with the Chair, NOMCO and subsequently all Board members.
Insight
The feedback from Board Directors was positive throughout their 
responses to the evaluation. Views were provided on a number of 
topics including: composition and diversity; skills, capabilities and 
competencies; engagement with, and/or challenge of, management; 
atmosphere in the room; management of meetings; the support the 
Board and Board committees receive; strategic focus; oversight of 
risk and risk management; stakeholder engagement; and any 
priorities for 2025.
Board dynamics
Noting also the Board Dynamics review, the Non-Executive Directors' 
support and challenge of management rated well, with the Non-
Executive Directors welcoming extra informal time with the EC as 
planned for future meetings.
Board oversight 
The Board's oversight in framing and setting the Group's strategy rated 
highly, as did the Board's understanding of the capacity of the Group 
to deliver and its monitoring of external developments. Strategy was 
identified as a continued area of focus for 2025. The Board's oversight 
of risk and risk management rated highly, with risk appetite and risk 
mitigation continuing to be a priority. The Board's oversight of the 
development of senior talent and success planning rated highly, 
with the process considered to be well organised.
Management of meetings
Themes included continued: (i) focus on interaction between Non-
executive Directors and EC members to more fully leverage the skills of 
individual Non-executive Directors as appropriate outside of the formal 
Board setting; and (ii) engagement with external speakers to bring 
diverse and external perspectives into the boardroom on key issues 
facing Shell. 
Overall, the Board was found to be functioning well, with a high level 
of commitment from both the Non-executive and Executive Directors. 
There are good personal relationships, amid a collegial spirit, with a 
high degree of mutual respect. Directors are able to share opinions 
and offer guidance and feel that they are heard. The agenda has been 
broad and the committees have complemented the Board agenda to 
ensure that the Board has covered the areas viewed to be key.
Governance
169 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

Feedback themes for the committees 
The committees were considered to be well chaired and well operated 
and received excellent input from senior management. All committee 
reviews provided focus on meeting management and effectiveness, 
oversight, and performance improvement opportunities. Each 
committee analysed topics specific to their respective forum. The 
committees also provided feedback on the implementation of 
recommendations from the 2023 evaluation process. 
Chair evaluation
The Deputy Chair communicated feedback to the Chair, who was 
considered to have built and maintained strong relationships with 
the Executive and Non-executive Directors. He was also thought 
to communicate well, be constructive and open at all times, 
encouraging all Board members to make a full contribution to 
discussions. References to his accessibility and openness to input 
from others were made and these are valued across the Board. 
Delivery against the 2024 ambitions
The Board continued to focus on being a well-functioning Board 
and spent additional time on strategic matters, including with 
respect to the implementation of ETS24 and the continued delivery 
on CMD23, focusing on shareholder value and operating expenditure 
efficiencies. With respect to risk oversight, the Board continued 
to optimise the work of both the Board and the Audit and Risk 
Committee on risk-related matters.
Planned enhancements for 2025
The 2024 Board evaluation provided areas of focus or priorities for 
2025, including: (i) CMD25 and longer-term strategy; (ii) continued 
Non-executive Director engagement with members of the EC outside 
the formal Board setting; and (iii) continued engagement with external 
speakers to bring diverse and external perspectives to the boardroom 
on key issues facing Shell. Other items identified which are already 
being progressed in 2025 include enhancement of Board skills and 
capabilities; further focus on risk appetite and risk mitigation; and 
continued improvement to pre-read materials. 
Statement of compliance with the
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Board confirms that, throughout the year, the Company has 
applied the principles, both in spirit and in form, and complied with 
the provisions set out in the current UK Corporate Governance Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018 (the 
"Code"), with the exception of Provision 5 noted below. In January 
2024, the FRC published a new version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which will apply to the 2025 Annual Report. 
A copy of the Code can be found on the FRC's website: frc.org.uk. 
Shell's governance arrangements have been considered alongside 
the Code. The information set out in the Directors' Report, including 
the Board committee reports on pages 171-190, is intended to provide 
an explanation of how the Code's principles were applied practically 
throughout the year. We also provide clear and meaningful 
explanation below where we believe stakeholders may benefit 
from more specific information on a particular Code provision.
Workforce engagement (Provision 5)
The size and diversity of our employee base and wider workforce have 
complicated the feasibility of implementing any of the three specific 
workforce engagement methods recommended in the Code. The Board 
believes that its current approach to workforce engagement continues 
to be pragmatic and effective, particularly when considered against 
the required coverage needed for a global organisation, such as 
Shell. Elsewhere in this Annual Report, we explain how our people are 
essential to the successful delivery of the Shell strategy, and how the 
Board recognises the importance of understanding their views through 
engagement. During the year, the Board and individual Directors were 
able to visit our sites across the world, which helped the Board engage 
with parts of the workforce and gain insight into the work, culture and 
impact of Shell in communities. During these engagements, there were 
opportunities for the Board to speak with our stakeholders and obtain 
feedback. The Board also intends to keep the effectiveness of the 
engagements under review. Stakeholder engagement also continues 
to be enhanced in management reporting.
 
More information on the current approach and a description of the channels used by 
the Board, its committees and the Executive Committee are outlined in "Workforce 
engagement" on pages 167-168. 
AGM voting (Provision 4)
At the 2024 AGM, 21.97% of shareholders who voted voted against a 
resolution proposed by the Board which related to the approach Shell 
was taking with regard to its energy transition strategy. Provision 4 of 
the Code requires certain actions to be undertaken if 20% or more of 
shareholders vote in a way which is different to what the Board 
recommended. There are three stages to these actions. First, explain 
when announcing the voting results what actions the Company intends 
to take to consult shareholders to understand the reasons behind the 
voting result. Shell included this explanation with its voting results, 
published on May 21, 2024. Second, an update on the engagement 
with shareholders should be published no later than six months after 
the shareholder meeting. This statement was added to the Shell 
website on November 1, 2024. Third, a final summary of the 
engagement and the actions taken should be included within the 
Annual Report. This information is provided on page 165.
Corporate governance requirements outside the UK
In addition to complying with applicable corporate governance 
requirements in the UK, the Company complies with the rules of 
Euronext Amsterdam and Dutch securities laws because of its listing 
on that exchange. The Company, likewise, adheres to US securities 
laws and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations 
because its securities are registered in the USA and listed on the NYSE.

Purpose
The Nomination and Succession Committee (the "NOMCO") leads the 
process for appointments to the Board and Senior Management [A] 
positions, ensures plans are in place for orderly, well-planned 
succession, and oversees the development of a diverse succession 
pipeline of candidates. It also reviews the Company's policy, targets 
and strategy on diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and monitors 
the effectiveness of these initiatives. It makes recommendations to 
the Board on corporate governance guidelines, as referred to in 
the Chair's introduction.
[A] In this section of the report, "Senior Management" refers to the Executive Committee 
and the Company Secretary, as defined by the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Talent management and succession
The NOMCO is fully engaged with the end-to-end talent management 
and senior succession planning approach that is deployed within Shell. 
It plays a key role in senior succession and resourcing. Retaining in-
depth knowledge of the individuals within the talent pipeline is a 
NOMCO priority. The NOMCO makes time to personally meet and 
engage with numerous individuals within the pipeline. The NOMCO's 
oversight and input extend from recruitment to leadership identification 
and from leadership development to leadership appointment, all of 
which are underpinned by clearly articulated talent priorities and a 
commitment to advancing DE&I across Shell.
The NOMCO manages Board and supports Senior Management 
succession under a structured, proactive methodology. The processes 
have clear and agreed selection principles for short-, medium- and long-
term succession and are aligned with Shell's strategic priorities.
For Non-executive Director succession, the NOMCO continues to 
follow its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, adding 
factors as they evolve. These principles include both quantitative and 
qualitative principles, considering:
￮the overall aspired Board composition and diversity of age; gender; 
race; ethnicity; educational, social, geographical and professional 
backgrounds; skills; knowledge; and experience that align with the 
Company's strategy including among other criteria consideration 
of the skills and strengths needed for the energy transition; and
￮ the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected of Directors.
Governance
171 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 174 ----
During the year, the Principles for the Strategic Composition of the 
Board were reviewed and updated. The NOMCO also focused on 
the future needs for the Board's composition, including size and tenure, 
skills and experience, and the DE&I requirements of the UK Listing 
Rules, FTSE Women Leaders and the Parker Review. The current size 
of the Board was considered to be appropriate, also taking account 
of Committee memberships. Greater flexibility around Non-executive 
tenure continues to be an area of focus. Although Shell does not 
publish its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, its 
Board Diversity Policy (which was first published in March 2024) is 
available on the Company's website. This Policy highlights that Shell 
aims for a gender balance on the Board, with at least one senior Board 
position (Chair, CEO or CFO) held by a woman. In addition, Shell's 
target is to maintain the representation of both men and women at, or 
above, a minimum of 40% [B].We believe that this allows Shell to be 
truly representative of all genders and gender identities and provides 
flexibility during periods of change. Further, Shell aims to maintain 
or exceed having at least one Board member from a minority ethnic 
background. For more details on the progress against these targets 
see page 174. 
[B] These targets align with those set by the FCA under the UK Listing Rules, and all such 
targets on Board diversity remain subject to applicable equalities legislation, including 
the Equality Act 2010 (as amended from time to time) and its provisions on discrimination.
See "Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 219.
For Senior Management succession, the selection principles include 
process-specific elements, such as a clear and proactive approach 
to identifying and developing succession candidates. The principles 
also outline the long-term structured nature of the succession planning 
process. There is also strong focus on ensuring that the principles reflect 
the leadership qualities required for future business success and that 
they advance the progress of diversity in all its forms.
Senior Management principles feature in the NOMCO's review 
of the succession plans which occurs in every committee meeting. Using 
the principles, the NOMCO implements any changes through a well-
defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The 
NOMCO agrees on candidate profiles and meets prospective 
candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. 
It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors 
have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. 
Consequently, some of the leaders with whom the NOMCO and 
Board engaged extensively in the past became or are about to 
become members of the Board (Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman) or 
the Executive Committee (most recently, Andrew Smith, Machteld de 
Haan,Cederic Cremers and Peter Costello whose appointments are 
effective April 1, 2025).
During 2024, the NOMCO's annual in-depth look at the status and 
succession plans for Senior Management within Shell, along with the 
review of the talent pipeline in line with the business, was undertaken 
by the full Board. The Board reflected on the simplification of the senior 
leadership structure with clear accountabilities achieved in 2024 with 
a view to the further evolvement of the composition of the total workforce 
and of the organisation's culture as an enabler for performance.
Diversity of leadership
The NOMCO recognises that continuing to improve all types of 
diversity at each level of the Shell Group is crucial. Shell aims to be 
an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected 
and has a strong sense of belonging. The NOMCO's review of 
diversity objectives and strategies for the Shell Group as a whole 
also monitors the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives. 
In February 2021, Shell published its aspirations for DE&I under 
the Powering lives goal, with a focus on four areas of gender, race 
and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion. For more details on the 
progress against our ambitions for women hired and women in Senior 
Leadership, see pages 117-118.
"Senior Leadership" is a Shell-specific measure based on compensation 
grade levels. This is different from what we are required to report under 
the Code, which is female representation in Senior Management and 
their direct reports, where the percentage is 32%.
Nationality diversity, such as Asian and American talent, continues to 
be managed in accordance with the business outlook and we have a 
strong focus on progressing race and ethnic minority representation.
In line with the recommendations from the 2023 Parker Review, Shell 
has reviewed its ambitions for ethnic minority representation at the 
Senior Management level and aims for 15% Senior Management 
positions [C] to be occupied by ethnic minority executives by 
December 2027. As at the end of 2024, 15% of Shell's Senior 
Management identifies as being from an ethnic minority group. 
[C] Senior Management here refers to senior leadership based in the UK and is a Shell 
measure based on compensation grade levels. We have moved to this Shell definition 
of Senior Management for 2024 onwards to align with our self-identification data 
collection and processes.
Although the NOMCO monitors Shell's organisational DE&I strategies 
and initiatives, it also holds itself accountable for the Board's own 
diversity and inclusion. Back in 2020, the Board's diverse composition 
met the Hampton Alexander requirements (now FTSE Women Leaders) 
and, in 2024, it met the Parker Reviews' objectives by reflecting 42% 
women representation with three Directors from a minority ethnic 
background. Shell's Board diversity is aligned with the targets set by 
UK Listing Rules. The position of CFO is held by a woman and three 
Directors are from a minority ethnic background.
 
See "Powering lives" on pages 117-119 for more information on DE&I in Shell.

The People Strategy and diversity, equity and inclusion
Diversity continued to be a key area of focus during the year. In 2024, 
Shell published a new Board Diversity Policy further to a 
recommendation by the NOMCO. The policy is aligned to the 
requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code and includes our 
targets for Board diversity, as well as complementing Shell's wider 
diversity policies and embracing Shell's values, Code of Conduct and 
sustainability goals. Currently, this policy is not applied to the 
individual Committees, although we strive to apply diverse 
representation across the Committees. DE&I across Committee 
membership remains an ongoing consideration. A copy of the Board 
Diversity Policy is available on our website, shell.com/investors/
environmental-social-and-governance/board-of-directors.
In relation to Board director appointments and diversity, the NOMCO 
oversees the development of a diverse pipeline for succession to 
the Board and monitors that all Board appointments are subject 
to a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure and that such 
appointments are based on merit and objective criteria taking into 
account (among other things) factors such as diversity of gender, 
age, educational and professional background, social, ethnic and 
geographical background and cognitive and personal strengths. 
To this end, the NOMCO is responsible for engaging an independent 
executive search consultant, who assists in preparing shortlists 
of candidates, co-ordinating interviews and seeking references. 
In accordance with the Board Diversity Policy, the NOMCO only 
engages with external search firms who are able to align with 
Shell's approach to DE&I in identifying suitable individuals from 
diverse pools of candidates.
Under the Board Diversity Policy, the Board commits to: 
￮ Ensuring an inclusive environment: Through inclusive behaviours and 
practices, we aim to create an environment in which every Board 
member feels valued, respected and empowered to contribute fully.
￮ Ensuring support for External Best Practices: The Board endorses and 
supports external best practices, such as the FTSE Women Leaders 
Review, Parker Review and others, to maintain and enhance diversity 
within the Board.
￮ Ensuring that Board appointments are managed with rigour and 
transparency: Candidates are evaluated based on merit, skills, 
experience, qualifications, performance and business considerations, 
with due regard for diversity factors.
￮ Ensuring regular Board composition reviews: The Board regularly 
assesses the composition of the Board, including age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, educational, social, geographical and professional 
backgrounds, skills, knowledge and experience, making 
recommendations for necessary adjustments.
Shell has an inclusive Board environment, comprising individuals that 
are suitably qualified. They have the required skills, industry expertise, 
breadth of perspective and high-quality decision-making capabilities 
to support the strategy and overall direction of Shell. 
 
See "The Board of Shell plc" on pages 152-156 for details about the skills and backgrounds 
of individual members. 
From a gender perspective, the Board comprises five female directors 
and seven male directors, which equates to 42% female representation 
(2023: 42%, 2022: 55%). Two of the four main Board committees are 
chaired by a female director.
While the Board aspires to achieve gender parity, progress against 
diversity targets is sensitive to the size of the Board. In respect of other 
forms of diversity, three members of the Board self-identify as being 
from an ethnic minority background [D]. In accordance with the Board 
Diversity Policy, the Board firmly believes that diversity fosters a 
broader range of perspectives, resulting in improved Board 
effectiveness, decision-making and outcomes.
[D] Ethnic minority refers to an individual who self-identifies as Asian, Black, Mixed/multiple, 
or other ethnic minority group, in line with UK Office for National Statistics classifications

the outcome of the evaluation).
[A] The NOMCO was assisted during 2024 by Russell Reynolds Associates ("Russell Reynolds") and, more recently, by Korn Ferry (UK) Limited ("Korn Ferry"), both of which are external global 
search companies whose main role was to propose suitable candidates. Neither Russell Reynolds nor Korn Ferry has any connection with the Company other than that of search consultants. 
The Chair does not participate in discussions regarding his own succession. Russell Reynolds and Korn Ferry are signatories to The Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, 
which aims to improve board diversity.Executive Committee succession
The NOMCO undertakes comprehensive engagement to understand who the candidates are for senior roles, what personally 
drives them and how they will ensure Shell achieves its strategic ambitions. 
Succession for senior roles is planned well in advance and reviewed regularly. Succession planning is a crucial, ongoing 
consideration and not just an area of focus when an Executive Committee (EC) member change is anticipated. The Board oversees 
Shell's succession planning process in which selection is the final step of a rigorous, sophisticated and well-planned process.
For Executive Director and EC appointments, the NOMCO has set a structured process:
￮ Before any potential decision on resourcing, it explicitly describes the requirements of the role and the candidate profile.
￮ By working in a planned, consistent manner, last-minute surprises are avoided and well-considered decisions are made in line with 
evolving business requirements.
￮ It also plans for the unexpected and maintains a list of candidates capable of stepping into senior roles to provide cover if necessary.
The NOMCO spends time getting to know the candidates to ensure that the pipeline is robust, diverse and adaptive. The NOMCO 
ensures it has visibility of today's and tomorrow's leaders. Over the last few years, the NOMCO has met many leaders and had extensive 
engagements with each of them. Some of these leaders now sit on the EC, others were appointed to the Board (Wael Sawan and Sinead 
Gorman).
The NOMCO engages across the executive talent pipeline to ensure it interacts with and becomes familiar with talent at different 
levels of the organisation; for example, on a regular basis informal engagements are held with employees from a range of businesses, 
functions and backgrounds prior to a Board meeting. Not only does this engagement support senior succession, it also provides a helpful 
element of the NOMCO's workforce engagement.
The Board is proud that candidates for the most senior leadership roles have primarily come from within the business, demonstrating that 
the leadership development and succession process remains effective.

Audit and Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present our Audit and Risk Committee (the ARC) 
Report for 2024. 
The ARC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in 
areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of 
risk management and internal controls, as well as the consideration 
of ethics and compliance matters. We are responsible for assessing 
the quality of the audit performed by, and the independence 
and objectivity of, the external auditor. The ARC also makes a 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment or reappointment 
of the external auditor. In addition, we oversee the work and quality 
of the internal audit function.
Our work programme over the course of a year focuses on a variety of 
matters that involve a high degree of judgement and/or are significant 
to Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. We review with 
management the sources of estimation uncertainty and other key 
assumptions against the backdrop of economic and market uncertainty 
and volatility, climate risk and the energy transition and evolving 
stakeholder expectations. In addition, we consider the robustness 
of the risk and internal control framework, results of internal control 
testing performed throughout the year, and remediation activities. 
"The primary role of the ARC is to assist 
the Board in fulfilling its oversight 
responsibilities in areas such as the integrity 
of financial reporting, the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal controls, 
as well as the consideration of ethics 
and compliance matters."
Ann Godbehere
Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee
Topics addressed in 2024 included: deferred taxes and tax exposures; 
the impact on tax balances and disclosures as a result of windfall and 
minimum taxes around the world; significant portfolio developments; 
litigation; impairment trigger assessments; impairment charges 
and reversals; accounting for complex contracts; dividend distribution 
capacity; and mark-to-market derivatives accounting, including the 
impact of volatile gas and power markets. 
We received briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor on the outcomes 
of significant audits and notable control matters. We also received 
briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor and the Executive Vice 
President (EVP) Controller on the effectiveness of Shell's risk 
management and internal control system.
The impacts of climate change and the energy transition continue 
to touch on many aspects of the ARC's work, including the financial 
statement impacts. The ARC also considered sustainability-related 
disclosures required in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD).
The ARC, recognising the evolving nature of climate change risks and 
responses, concluded that climate change has been appropriately 
considered by management in key judgements and estimates and 
agreed with the disclosure made by management.
As noted in last year's report, during 2023, the tender process for 
the appointment of the external auditor was commenced, with a view 
to reaching a conclusion during 2024. We completed the process 
during 2024 and the ARC recommended to the Board that EY be re-
appointed as the Company's external auditor in respect of the financial 
year ending December 31, 2026. Further information with respect to 
this process is set out on page 186.
During 2024, the ARC received updates on the implementation of the 
Shell Performance Framework. Focus topics for 2024 included Trading 
and Supply; CSRD implementation, Shell's Carbon Management 
Framework, regulatory developments, for example in relation to UK 
corporate governance reforms, fraud and sustainability reporting 
regulations; information risk management, including cyber security; 
and pensions.
As part of its oversight of compliance with applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance 
risks, the ARC discussed with the Group Chief Ethics and Compliance 
Officer activities undertaken in the ethics and compliance programme 
related to compliance with data privacy laws and regulations and 
artificial intelligence (AI), and steps taken to manage those risks. 
In 2024, members of the ARC visited Oman, Qatar and Brazil as part 
of Board site visits. These site visits deepen directors' understanding 
of risks and opportunities, as well as their understanding of how the 
Company's strategy is being implemented. See "Understanding and 
engaging with our stakeholders" for further information in relation 
to Board site visits.
On a final note, the ARC recognises the strong commitment and 
dedication of the financial and non-financial reporting teams and 
would like to thank them for all their efforts during 2024.

[A] In addition to the six meetings, as part of its activities in 2024, the ARC held 
additional meetings in relation to the external audit tender process.
All ARC members are financially literate, independent Non-executive 
Directors. In respect of the year ended December 31, 2024, for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Ann Godbehere 
qualifies as: a person with "recent and relevant financial experience" 
and competence in accounting, and, for the purposes of US securities 
laws, an "audit committee financial expert".
The experience of the ARC members outlined on pages 152-156 
demonstrates that the ARC as a whole has competence relevant 
to the sector in which Shell operates, and the necessary commercial, 
regulatory, financial and audit expertise required to fulfil its 
responsibilities. The ARC members have gained further knowledge 
and experience of the sector as a result of their Board membership 
and through various in-person and virtual site visits since their 
respective appointments. 
The ARC invites the CFO, the Legal Director, the Chief Internal Auditor, 
the EVP Controller, the Vice President Group Appraisal and Reporting 
and Deputy Controller and the external auditor to attend each 
meeting. The CEO, the Chair of the Board and the Company Secretary 
may also attend ARC meetings. Other members of management attend 
when requested on specific topics or to provide input on more detailed 
technical matters that may arise. The ARC regularly holds private 
sessions separately with the Chief Internal Auditor and the external 
auditor without members of management present (except for the Legal 
Director who may attend). Outside of the formal ARC meetings, the 
Chair of the ARC meets regularly with each of the following: the CFO, 
the EVP Controller, the Chief Internal Auditor and the external auditor.
Committee remit
The roles and responsibilities of the ARC are set out in its Terms of 
Reference and are reviewed annually (last reviewed and updated 
in December 2024, a copy of which can be found on shell.com).

arising from its operation; and 
￮ overseeing compliance with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance risks. 
Internal audit
￮monitoring the qualifications, expertise, resources and independence 
of the internal audit function; 
￮ approving the internal audit function's charter and the annual 
internal audit plan to ensure alignment with the key risks of 
the business;
￮ reviewing with the Chief Internal Auditor, the Company's 
management and the external auditors any significant matters 
arising from internal audits and assessing management's response 
to internal audit findings and control weaknesses as appropriate, 
including potential improvements and agreed actions; and
￮ assessing internal audit's performance and effectiveness each year. 
External audit
￮reviewing and monitoring the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor; 
￮ considering the annual external audit plan and approving related 
remuneration, including fees for audit and non-audit services; 
￮ assessing the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor 
and the audit process, including an assessment of the quality of the 
audit; and 
￮ recommending to the Board that it put to the Company's 
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
a resolution to appoint, reappoint, or remove the external auditor.
The ARC's responsibilities as set out in its Terms of Reference form the 
basis of the ARC's annual work plan, which is adjusted as appropriate 
throughout the year. In addition, the ARC annually identifies certain 
business and function areas to focus on during that year. The focus 
areas generally encompass aspects of risk management and internal 
control, financial reporting and compliance. The ARC is authorised to 
seek any information it requires from management and external parties 
and to investigate issues or concerns as it deems appropriate. The ARC 
may also obtain independent professional advice at the Company's 
expense. No such independent advice was requested in 2024. 
The ARC keeps the Board informed of its activities and 
recommendations, and the Chair of the ARC provides an update to the 
Board after every ARC meeting. The ARC discusses with the Board if it 
is not satisfied with or believes that action or improvement is required 
concerning any aspect of financial reporting, risk management and 
internal control, compliance or audit-related activities. 
Focus areas for 2024
The ARC met with senior leaders from various business and function 
areas to discuss the adequacy, design and operational effectiveness 
of risk management and controls related to the critical activities carried 
out by their respective business or function. The discussions included 
information on any enhancements to strengthen controls and how 
areas identified for improvement had been addressed; the monitoring 
of activities around key risks; and the steps being taken to identify 
new or emerging areas of risk. 
In addition to the significant accounting and reporting considerations 
discussed on pages 181-182, the business and function areas reviewed 
by the ARC in 2024 included the following:
￮Shell Performance Framework -- the ARC received updates on 
progress with the implementation of the Shell Performance 
Framework (SPF) following its introduction in July 2023. The ARC 
discussed with management how the SPF is being applied in 
practice, including simplification of standards and cultural change 
from a performance, discipline and simplification perspective. 
￮ Trading and Supply (T&S) – the ARC was briefed in relation to the 
T&S organisational mandate, governance and oversight committees, 
including in relation to financial risk management and stress-testing. 
The ARC also received an update regarding process, data and 
transformation systems. 
￮ CSRD implementation -- the ARC received regular updates in relation 
to the additional disclosures required by the CSRD, including the 
challenges with the reporting, the double materiality assessment 
and assurance requirements.
￮ Regulatory developments – the ARC was briefed regularly 
regarding regulatory developments and their implications for 
Shell, including for example, in the UK, in relation to the 2024

Risk management
and internal control
The ARC assists the Board in reviewing the emerging, principal and 
other significant risks facing the Group and in fulfilling its responsibilities 
in relation to risk management and internal control. In order to monitor 
the effectiveness of the procedures for internal control over financial 
reporting, compliance and operational matters, the ARC reviews 
reports on risks, controls and assurance, including the annual 
assessment of the system of risk management and internal control. 
The ARC also reviews management's evaluation of the internal control 
of financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX 404). The ARC updated the Board on compliance 
with internal controls across the Shell Group and on any major 
matters for which action or improvement was recommended.

Throughout the year, the ARC and management discuss Shell's 
overall approach to risk management and internal control, including 
compliance, tax and information risk management matters and the 
adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures. The ARC receives 
regular reports from the EVP Controller on the status of actions to 
address control weaknesses identified via business control incidents 
and the trends in other measures used to monitor the robustness of 
the risk management framework and internal control systems.
 
The ARC is also briefed on litigation and other matters (see Note 32 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on pages 308-310 and "Other regulatory and statutory information" 
on page 222).
For 2024, reviews included overall assessment of the risk landscape, 
including controls, exception reporting and SIAI observations as well as 
deep dives on specific areas. The ARC also regularly reviews the status 
of management's SOX 404 testing of controls and remediation actions 
to address any identified weaknesses. The ARC and management also 
discussed the steps taken to maintain an effective control environment 
and to further demonstrate "management in control" during the year.
It is important that the ARC monitors and learns about relevant evolving 
external developments in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the ARC 
is regularly briefed on developments in the legal, regulatory and 
financial reporting landscape that could affect the Company. 
In 2024, the ARC dedicated time to the following topics:
￮ Tax risks – In addition to the regular review of Shell's tax provisions, 
the ARC received updates regarding developments in the external 
tax landscape, including windfall and minimum taxes and how 
different jurisdictions are seeking to incentivise investment when 
entering new markets and businesses. Management outlined for 
the ARC the steps being taken to manage tax risks and exposures 
arising from differing viewpoints on complex tax laws. 
￮ Information risk management, including cyber security – The ARC 
was briefed in relation to Shell's information risk management 
framework, against the backdrop of a deteriorating external threat 
environment and evolving global regulatory landscape, including 
SEC cyber-security disclosure rules. 
￮ Oil and gas reserves control framework – The ARC annually reviews 
the framework that supports Shell's internal reporting and external 
disclosures of oil and gas reserves. The ARC also reviews the 
processes and controls that prevent and/or mitigate the risks of
non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. This annual 
review of Shell's oil and gas reserves control framework supports 
the ARC's review of Shell's reported proved oil and gas reserves 
discussed later in this report.
In addition to the above, the ARC also had quarterly discussions with 
the Chief Internal Auditor regarding the Company's risk management 
and internal control system, significant matters arising from the internal 
audit assurance programme and management's response to internal 
audit findings and control weaknesses, including potential 
improvements and agreed actions.
The ARC similarly holds discussions with EY, the external auditor, on a 
quarterly basis regarding how risks to audit quality are addressed, key 
accounting and audit judgements, results from audit procedures and 
management's response to any significant audit findings and any 
material communications between EY and management.

A
A = Annually Q = Quarterly P = Periodically 
The ARC reviewed the Company's 2024 quarterly unaudited interim 
financial statements, half-year report, Annual Report and Form 20-F 
with management and the external auditor. 
Shell uses alternative performance measures (APMs) to provide greater 
insights into its financial and operating results. The ARC regularly 
considers the APMs used in Shell's reporting, the reconciliations to IFRS 
financial statements and explanations for changes from the previous 
quarter and year. The ARC reviews the overall presentation of APMs 
with management to ensure they are not given undue prominence. 
The ARC discusses adjusting items with management including any 
changes to methodology. 
The APMs disclosed by Shell are subject to the same internal control 
process as applied for other financial reporting. 
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
The ARC advised the Board that in its view the 2024 Annual Report 
including the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2024, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's 
position and performance, business model and strategy (see "Other 
regulatory and statutory information" on page 223). To arrive at this 
conclusion, the ARC critically assessed drafts of the 2024 Annual 
Report including the financial statements and discussed with 
management the process undertaken to ensure that the relevant 
requirements were met. This process included: verifying that the 
contents of the 2024 Annual Report are consistent with the information 
shared with the Board during the year to support their assessment of 
Shell's position and performance; ensuring that consistent materiality 
thresholds are applied for favourable and unfavourable items; 
considering observations from the external auditor; and receiving 
assurance from the Executive Committee (EC).
Going concern and viability statement
The ARC reviewed the Directors' half-year and full-year statements 
with respect to the going concern basis of accounting. As noted in the 
viability statement, the Board reviews the strategic plan which takes 
account of longer-term forecasts and a wide range of outlooks. Key 
assumptions included: the impact of commodity prices; exchange 
rates; production levels, product demand and schedules of growth 
programmes; the financial framework; Shell's business portfolio 
developments including consideration of the impacts of various possible 
energy pathways and scenarios for changes in societal expectations 
in relation to climate change and Shell's commitment to the Paris 
Agreement goals; the project funnel to support future growth; and using 
severe but possible scenarios to run models of the financial impact if 
certain of Shell's principal risks materialised. The ARC considered the 
mitigating measures and sensitivities that management had applied 
to the modelling of scenarios when evaluating the viability statement. 
The ARC also considered the merits of extending the viability statement 
beyond a period of three years and concluded that the three-year 
period selected by the Board for the review of Shell's prospects, in line 
with the Operating Plan, remained appropriate. Particularly noting that 
assumptions do go well beyond the three-year period and do take into 
account climate change and energy transition, the ARC supported the 
going concern basis of accounting and the inclusion of Shell's viability 
statement in "Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 217. 
The ARC considered such statement to be in line with best practice 
guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).

Significant accounting and reporting considerations
The ARC assessed the following significant accounting and reporting areas, including those related to Shell's 2024 Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The ARC was satisfied with how each of the areas below was addressed. As part of this assessment, the ARC received reports, 
requested and received clarifications from management, and sought assurance and received input from the internal and external auditors. 
Climate change and energy transition
Risks related to climate change and the energy 
transition are regularly monitored to ensure impacts 
are reflected within Shell's financial statements.
The external landscape related to non-financial 
disclosures continues to evolve. In the absence of one 
global standard for climate-related reporting there 
are growing demands from various regulatory and 
voluntary bodies all with their own expectations 
for disclosures.
The ARC discussed with management key regulatory requirements including (but not limited to) the EU, 
ISSB, and SEC disclosure requirements and their implications or potential implications for Shell's external 
disclosures.
The ARC reviewed Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" summarising the key climate risk 
impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the impairment sensitivity disclosures using 
price outlooks based on different climate change scenarios, including external scenarios.
See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 255-265.
The ARC was briefed on the non-financial reporting external landscape developments and regulatory 
requirements. In this connection, the ARC considered the potential implications required for Shell's external 
disclosures going forward. The ARC reviewed regulatory sustainability disclosures including the new CSRD 
disclosures within the "Sustainability Statements" section, and other non-financial disclosures as part of the 
Annual Report review. The ARC was also briefed on the EU Taxonomy disclosures included within 
"Sustainability Statements" section.
Updates regarding climate change and energy transition risk factor have been included on pages 137-138.
Impairment and impairment reversals
The carrying amount of an asset should be tested 
for impairment or impairment reversal whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the recoverable amount for that asset may have 
changed, for example if there is a change in the 
outlook for commodity prices or refining margin 
assumptions, or in the event of revisions to future 
activity plans and developments. On classification 
as held for sale, the carrying amounts of property, 
plant and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets 
must also be reviewed.
The ARC reviewed the impairment assessments that were performed each quarter, and the methodology 
applied in conducting impairment assessments.
The ARC considered continued volatility in global risk-free interest rates, alongside other input assumptions, 
in assessing market expectations of the expected rate of return on various assets for the purposes of 
impairment testing. This included reviewing the outcomes of periodic reassessments of the weighted 
average cost of capital during the year, including management's conclusion on the reasonability of the 
discount rate applied as at December 31, 2024. The ARC was satisfied the discount rate applied 
throughout the period was appropriate.
The ARC considered the updated oil and gas price outlooks against market developments and benchmarks. 
The 2024 commodity price outlook was reassessed to determine whether revised price premises would 
result in a trigger for impairment or impairment reversal. Based on the analysis performed, no triggers 
were identified.
The ARC also reviewed other circumstances that may indicate that the recoverable amount of assets have 
changed, such as those related to revision of future plans and developments, exploration and evaluation 
assets, held-for-sale classification for asset disposals and margin assumptions. The ARC also reviewed the 
outcomes of goodwill testing. 
See Notes 2, 11, 12 and 13 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 245-255, 274-275, 
275-276 and 277-279.
Gas and power markets and derivatives accounting
External events during the year affected trading 
activities. The impacts on financial outcomes of 
Integrated Gas, and Renewables and Energy 
Solutions included, for example, significant 
derivatives movements.
The ARC reviewed Trading and Supply activities and developments, including analysis of the trading 
strategies employed, their impact on financial metrics, and the associated accounting treatment applied.
The ARC reviewed the impacts of volatile gas and power markets including the impact on mark-to-
market valuation of derivatives, income for the period and adjusted earnings, as well as the resulting 
cash flow movements.
See Note 26 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 298-304.

Issue Committee activity and outcome
Taxation
The determination of tax assets and liabilities requires 
the application of judgement as to the ultimate 
outcome, which can change over time. In particular, 
uncertain tax treatments require management to assess 
the more-likely-than-not outcome, and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets requires management to make 
assumptions regarding future profitability. As a result, 
they are inherently uncertain.
The ARC considered the uncertain tax positions and discussed management's assumptions of future 
taxable profits. The ARC also evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets 
and tax liabilities. The ARC recognises that assumptions regarding future taxable profits are inherently 
uncertain because they involve assessing factors such as the potential impacts of climate change and 
the energy transition. The ARC deemed the assessments of uncertain tax exposures and the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities to be reasonable.
On June 20, 2023, the UK substantively enacted the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules (Rules), effective as 
from January 1, 2024. The ARC has been updated on the implementation of the rules and the Pillar Two 
tax charges throughout the year.
See Notes 2 and 23 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 245-255 and 287-290.
Portfolio activities 
In implementing our strategy, several portfolio 
developments occurred in 2024.
The ARC discussed the accounting implications of these developments and the recognition of: (i) 
decommissioning and restoration provisions; (ii) deferred tax balances; (iii) impairment; and (iv) assets 
held for sale. The ARC also considered complex accounting treatments arising from acquisitions and 
divestments, including the proposed sale of Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore and the 
recognition of UK North Sea assets as held for sale at December 31, 2024.
See Notes 2 and 25 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 245-255 and 297.
Provisions, contingent liabilities and disclosures
Provisions, including decommissioning and restoration 
provisions, are one of the main components of the 
balance sheet liabilities. The quantification of these 
provisions requires judgements on input parameters 
which include, but are not limited to, discount rates 
and estimated future decommissioning and restoration 
costs. Contingent liabilities, arising from uncertain future 
events, are assessed for recognition or disclosure in line 
with reporting standards.
The ARC reviewed the input parameter assumptions and judgements used in arriving at the 
decommissioning and restoration provisions. 
The discount rate is reviewed regularly and the ARC considered the extent to which the rate applied 
remained appropriate in the context of volatile US Treasury yields. The ARC was satisfied that the rate 
applied remained appropriate as at December 31, 2024.
The ARC reviewed provisions, contingent liabilities and disclosures related to litigation, based on 
quarterly updates, for inclusion in the quarterly unaudited interim financial statements, half-year report, 
Annual Report and Form 20-F. The ARC also reviewed other provisions. 
The ARC has continued to receive updates on the withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities 
throughout 2024 including implications for the financial statements.
Retirement benefit obligations
Retirement benefits are an important component 
of both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. 
The quantification of these assets and liabilities requires 
judgements on input parameters which include, but are 
not limited to, actuarial assumptions and discount rates.
The ARC reviewed the management of risks in relation to retirement benefits in 2024, including financial, 
operational and regulatory developments. The ARC reviewed the key assumptions (including discount 
rates and inflation) and sensitivities as part of the Annual Report review and the enhanced disclosures 
made in this Report. The ARC also considered the accounting treatment for complex retirement benefit 
transactions, including the buy-out of pension liabilities in the USA and anticipated changes arising from 
the Future of Pensions Act in the Netherlands. 
See Note 24 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 290-296.
Other matters
Other significant accounting and reporting 
matters assessed.
The ARC considered segmentation requirements under IFRS 8 following the change announced to the 
Executive committee.
The ARC also reviewed: the year-end reported proved oil and gas reserves, including management 
judgements and adjustments made to reflect changes in geological, technical, contractual and economic 
information (including yearly average price assumptions) and the effectiveness of financial controls.

Ethics and compliance 
In 2024, the ARC received an update from the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer on how a range of macro factors and external 
trends and developments were affecting conduct risk at Shell. The Chief 
Ethics and Compliance Officer summarised the specific emerging ethics 
and compliance risks, with a particular focus on trade compliance and 
data privacy, and management's actions to manage and mitigate 
them. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer briefed the ARC 
on communications to staff from both senior leaders and mid-level 
management reinforcing the importance of adherence to and affirming 
Shell's commitment to the Ethics and Compliance framework and 
Code of Conduct throughout the year.
As part of the overall assessment of the system of risk management 
and internal control, the ARC discussed with the Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer their annual report on compliance matters. The 
report included an overview of the effectiveness of the Shell ethics and 
compliance programme in managing ethics and compliance risk in 
Shell's business activities, regulatory developments and compliance 
activities. The ARC also reviewed investigations of cases involving 
ethics and compliance concerns. The ARC discussed management's 
findings in such cases to satisfy itself that a rigorous process had been 
followed, with appropriate disciplinary action being taken where 
necessary, and that management had embedded learnings into 
Shell's systems and controls. 
Whistleblowing investigations
The ARC is responsible for establishing and monitoring the 
implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation 
and follow-up actions of complaints received, including those from the 
Shell Global Helpline. The ARC reviewed whistleblowing reports and 
internal audit reports and considered management's responses to the 
findings in these reports. In 2024, 2,025 allegations and enquiries 
were made through the Shell Global Helpline (2023: 2,134), of which 
approximately 39% were submitted anonymously (2023: 41%). In 
2024, a total of 555 investigations were closed (2023: 470), of which 
62% were found substantiated (2023: 54%) and were highest in the 
areas involving harassment, information and records management, 
conflicts of interest and protection of assets. 
Regulatory developments
The ARC was briefed on regulatory developments in areas including:
(i) sustainability and climate-related disclosures; (ii) accounting and 
reporting developments; (iii) environmental liabilities; (iv) treasury 
activities; and (v) the 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code.
ARC annual evaluation 
The ARC undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and 
effectiveness. As in 2023, in 2024 the Company Secretary facilitated 
the ARC's performance evaluation. Each ARC member responded to a 
confidential anonymised questionnaire about the ARC's performance 
covering questions on: the management of the ARC in areas such as 
the annual cycle of work and the agenda for meetings; the quality of 
the information provided to the ARC; the effectiveness of the ARC's 
oversight in areas such as financial reporting, risk management policies 
and practices and internal controls, and the work of internal and 
external audit; rating the ARC's performance in reviewing and 
assessing significant accounting/reporting issues; and how to improve 
the ARC's performance. The ARC considered that there had been 
significant progress on the feedback from the 2023 evaluation, 
including with respect to risk management and presentation; structure 
of internal audit updates and further enhancement of pre-read for ARC 
meetings. See also the Board evaluation section on page 169. Two 
themes from the 2024 evaluation process were identified as areas of 
focus for 2025, including further focus on litigation risk and Trading 
and Supply risk in a more challenging environment and continued 
enhancement of pre-read for ARC meetings. The ARC concluded that 
its performance in 2024 had been effective and that it had fulfilled 
its role in accordance with its Terms of Reference. 
In preparing its work plan for 2025, the ARC has included the 
following focus areas in addition to the standing items: Trading and 
Supply; regulatory developments, including corporate governance 
reforms, fraud and sustainability reporting regulations; information 
risk management, including cyber security; Pensions and Treasury.

Each quarter, the ARC discusses with the Chief Internal Auditor 
the Company's risk management and internal control system, any 
significant matters arising from the internal audit assurance programme 
and management's response to significant audit findings and notable 
control weaknesses, including planned improvements and agreed 
actions. In 2024, the Chief Internal Auditor's reports were developed 
with the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The ARC also holds private 
sessions separately with the Chief Internal Auditor without members of 
management, except for the Legal Director, who may attend. Outside 
of the formal ARC meetings, the Chair of the ARC meets regularly with 
the Chief Internal Auditor.
Internal audit remit
The internal audit function is an independent assurance function 
which supports Shell's continuous efforts to improve its overall control 
framework. The internal audit function contributes to the maintenance 
of a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
design and effectiveness of Shell's risk management, and control and 
governance processes. The primary role of the internal audit function's 
assurance and investigation activities is to safeguard value by 
protecting Shell's assets, reputation and sustainability in relation 
to the organisation's defined goals and objectives. 
The ARC defines the responsibility and scope of the internal audit 
function and approves its annual plan. The Chief Internal Auditor 
reports functionally to the Chair of the ARC and administratively 
to the Chief Financial Officer. The Chair of the ARC approves, in 
consultation with the Chief Financial Officer, all decisions regarding 
the performance evaluation, appointment or removal of the Chief 
Internal Auditor. A new Chief Internal Auditor was appointed with 
effect from March 2025. 
Annual internal audit plan and assessment of internal 
audit's effectiveness
The ARC considered and approved the internal audit function's annual 
audit plan, including these focus areas for 2024:
￮People -- talent and capability (professional audit development and 
technical capabilities). 
￮ Operational excellence -- further enhance the planning, execution 
and reporting processes. 
￮ Competitiveness -- increase value by tailoring its structure and 
targeting critical risks areas.
￮ Innovative technology -- further leveraging innovation and new 
technologies, such as AI and data analytics. 
The Chief Internal Auditor updated the ARC quarterly on the approved 
2024 internal audit plan and discussed whether the plan remained 
fit for purpose in addressing the most critical areas of risk. The ARC 
assessed the performance of the internal audit function as effective. 
The ARC also assessed the performance of the Chief Internal Auditor 
as effective.
The Chief Internal Auditor periodically assesses whether the purpose, 
authority and responsibilities of the internal audit function continue 
to enable it to accomplish its objectives. The results of this periodic 
assessment are communicated to the EC and the ARC. The Chief 
Internal Auditor also confirms to the ARC the continued validity of 
the charter of the internal audit function or puts forward proposals 
for updates to it. The Chief Internal Auditor maintains an internal 
quality assurance and improvement programme, including an annual 
assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the internal audit 
function's activities and evaluations of conformance with the standards 
of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA). The Chief Internal 
Auditor discusses the results of this annual assessment with the EC and 
the ARC. The Chief Internal Auditor also provided the ARC with an 
update on the status of implementation of the Institute of Internal 
Auditors new Global Internal Audit Standards which took effect 
on January 9, 2025, and noted the steps taken to meet the intent 
of these new standards.
At least every five years, the effectiveness and quality of the internal 
audit function are independently assessed externally, and the Chief 
Internal Auditor reviews the report with the EC and the ARC. 
An independent assessment of the internal audit was conducted at the 
end of 2022. The 2022 assessment confirmed that the internal audit 
conformed with the CIIA standards and the 2020 Internal Audit code 
of practice and identified some opportunities for further improvement. 
The next external assessment is planned to take place in 2027.

Annual external audit plan and assessment of external 
audit's effectiveness
EY reviewed with the ARC its audit strategy, scope and plan for 
the 2024 audit, highlighting areas which would receive special 
consideration. In particular, the ARC and EY discussed how the 
audit would take into consideration risks associated with: 
￮Trading and Supply complexity; 
￮ Revenue recognition fraud risk (unauthorised trading and 
management override);
￮ Climate change and the energy transition; 
￮ Oil and gas reserves;
￮ Impairment assessments;
￮ Litigation; 
￮ Decommissioning and restoration obligations;
￮ Accounting for divestments;
￮ Pensions; and
￮ Taxation. 
EY defines significant audit risks as those areas where there is a higher 
likelihood of a material error and which therefore require special audit 
attention. In EY's view, the significant audit risks are Trading and Supply 
complexity and the risk of unauthorised trading or management override.
The ARC considered the annual audit plan, which included assessing 
whether the planned materiality levels and proposed resources to 
execute the audit plan were consistent with the scope of the audit.
EY regularly updated the ARC on the status of its procedures and 
preliminary findings, providing an opportunity for the ARC to monitor 
the execution and results of the audit. The ARC and EY discussed how 
risks to audit quality were addressed, key accounting and audit 
judgements, material communications between EY and management 
and any issues arising from them. EY also reviewed with the ARC its 
risk assessments, materiality, scope and observations and conclusions 
in relation to Shell's CSRD disclosures.
Quarterly, the ARC meets privately with EY representatives without 
management (except for the Legal Director who may attend) being 
present in order to encourage open and transparent feedback from 
both parties. In addition, the Chair of the ARC meets separately with 
the external auditor on a regular basis. 
As part of its oversight of the external auditor, the ARC annually 
assesses the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and 
the audit process. This includes assessing the quality of the audit, how 
the auditor handled key judgements, and the auditor's response to the 
ARC's questions. The assessment also involves the ARC evaluating the 
objectivity and independence of EY and the quality and effectiveness 
of the external audit process. 
The ARC's evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor and the audit process includes the following key 
criteria:
￮professionalism, competence, integrity and objectivity during the 
audit, including handling of areas involving judgement and 
estimates; 
￮ EY's quality assurance procedures and internal quality control 
procedures; 
￮ audit quality priorities and actions taken as part of maintaining 
a sustainable audit quality programme;
￮ constructive challenge of management and key judgements; 
￮ efficiency, covering aspects such as service level and innovation 
in the audit process, use of data analytical and digital audit tools, 
and opportunities for improvement; 
￮ quality of the audit team's leadership;
￮ the most recent EY Transparency Report; 
￮ thought leadership and actions, especially in the areas of climate 
change; and 
￮ compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and professional 
requirements.
In addition to reflecting on its own experiences, including interactions 
with the external auditor throughout the year, the ARC considered 
and discussed the results of management's internal survey relating 
to EY's performance over the financial year 2024, which reflected 
a broadly comparable performance to 2023 and the views and 
recommendations from management and the Chief Internal Auditor.
As part of the current assessment of effectiveness, the ARC has taken 
into consideration the guidance issued by the FRC, including the 
guidance on oversight of the external audit set out in "Audit 
Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard".
Taking into account the above, the ARC is satisfied that EY continued 
to provide a high-quality and effective audit in its ninth year as auditor 
and maintained its objectivity, integrity and impartiality. As required 
under UK and US auditing standards, the ARC received a letter on 
independence-related matters from EY. EY also informed the ARC in 
writing of any significant relationships and matters that may reasonably 
be thought to affect its objectivity and independence. The ARC and EY 
discussed such relationships and matters and determined that they did 
not impair EY's objectivity, integrity and impartiality.

Audit Committees and the External Audit:
Minimum Standard
In May 2023, the FRC published "Audit Committees and the External 
Audit: Minimum Standard". This Audit and Risk Committee Report 
describes how the ARC has complied, to the extent applicable, with the 
provisions of the Minimum Standard during the year (in particular the 
"External Auditor" section of this report). There were no shareholder 
requests for certain matters to be covered in the audit during the 
year and there were no regulatory inspections of the quality of the 
Company's audit. An explanation of the Group's accounting policies 
is provided on pages 245-255.
Reappointment 2025 
The ARC is responsible for considering whether there should be a 
rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm in order 
to ensure continuing auditor quality and/or independence, including 
consideration of the advisability and potential impact of conducting 
a tender process for the appointment of a different independent 
public accounting firm. The ARC is also responsible for making 
a recommendation to the Board, for it to put to the Company's 
shareholders for approval in the General Meeting, on the 
appointment, reappointment, or removal of the external auditor.
At the AGM in May 2024, shareholders approved a resolution to 
reappoint EY as external auditor until the conclusion of the next AGM. 
EY was first appointed at the AGM in May 2016 after a competitive 
tender process. The lead audit partner, Gary Donald, has been in 
post since the start of the 2021 audit. Under UK legal requirements, 
the Company may retain EY as its external auditor for 20 years 
(see External audit tender below). For the 2024 financial year, the 
Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large 
Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014. 
In its oversight of the external audit, the ARC considered whether 
it would be appropriate to conduct an audit tender in respect of 
the 2025 audit.
The ARC reflected on: 
￮ its continued satisfaction with the quality and independence
of EY's audit; 
￮ any new external auditor would need a transition period to develop 
sufficient understanding of the business given Shell's size and complexity; 
￮ frequent changes of external auditor would be inefficient and could 
lead to increased risk and the loss of cumulative knowledge; 
￮ a change in auditor would be expected to have a significant 
impact on Shell, including on the Finance function; and 
￮ any change in auditor should be scheduled to limit operational 
disruption. 
The ARC also considered EY's leadership and activities in the area 
of climate change. 
After due consideration the ARC determined that it would not be 
appropriate to re-tender for the 2025 external audit at this time. 
The ARC has recommended to the Board that at the 2025 AGM the 
Board should propose that EY be reappointed as the external auditor 
of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2025. The ARC's 
recommendation is free from third-party influence and there are no 
contractual obligations that restrict the ARC's ability to make such 
a recommendation. 
External audit tender
The ARC acknowledges the UK legal requirements relating to mandatory 
audit rotation and audit tendering (with a requirement to undertake a 
formal process after ten years). As EY was appointed in 2016, the 
Company was required to tender for the audit no later than the financial 
year commencing January 1, 2026. The tender process, led by the ARC, 
was commenced during 2023 and completed in 2024. The ARC 
believes that this timeline for the re-tender was in the best interests of 
shareholders in order to provide enough time for an orderly transition 
in the event that a new audit firm was selected. In conducting the tender 
process, the ARC considered the guidance on tendering set out in the 
FRC's "Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard". 
All members of the ARC were involved throughout the external audit 
tender process.
Selection criteria
To enable an objective selection, weighted selection criteria were 
endorsed by the ARC in advance, with the choice of auditor being 
based on quality, including independence, challenge and technical 
competence and not price or perceived cultural fit. Minimum 
requirements which had to be met were independence; ethics and 
compliance; investigations by regulators; and legal terms and 
conditions. Whilst the audit fee was considered as part of the criteria, 
it was not a decisive factor, with the commercial scoping assessed 
subsequent to and separately from the quality assessment. 
Selection process
The ARC gave careful consideration to the potential candidate firms 
which included UK challenger firms with a "public interest entity" 
auditor registration. A request for information (RFI) was submitted
to six shortlisted firms in November 2023.
Following evaluation of the responses to the RFI, as well as the ARC 
having met in February 2024 with the proposed lead partners from 
firms which responded positively to the RFI, the ARC chose candidate 
firms for the next stage. This decision was based on quality, team and 
relevant experience for a company the size, scale and complexity 
as Shell.

External Auditor
continued
At its meeting in March 2024, the ARC discussed and endorsed the 
selection criteria and weighting for the audit tender. A Request for 
Proposal was issued to candidate firms in May 2024, followed by a 
series of management information sessions. The candidate firms had 
access to a data room, management across the organisation and 
visited various locations. The ARC met with representatives from the 
candidate firms in July 2024 to address any queries which the firms 
wished to raise and provide an opportunity for the ARC to raise 
any queries.
In September 2024, final proposals were submitted by the candidate 
firms. To support the ARC, scoring was performed on all criteria by a 
steering committee headed by the VP Group Appraisal and Reporting 
and Deputy Controller and comprising of (E)VPs of businesses and 
functions. The ARC received input from management, including on the 
scoring criteria, ahead of final meetings between the ARC and the 
candidate firms in December 2024. As part of the process, public reports 
published by the FRC and other regulators were also considered. 
ARC Recommendation
Following the meetings and review of each of the candidate firms' 
proposals and presentations, the ARC made its selection on the basis 
of its assessment of the abilities of each of the candidate firms. At the 
Board meeting in December 2024, the ARC recommended two 
possible audit firm options to the Board, with the ARC's preference to 
appoint EY, and supporting justifications. The ARC's recommendation 
was accepted by the Board and a resolution proposing the 
appointment of EY as the external auditor for the financial year 2026 
will be put forward to the shareholders for approval at the 2026 AGM. 
Non-audit services
The ARC maintains an auditor independence policy (AIP) in respect 
of the provision of services by the external auditor. Under the AIP, 
the ARC will only approve services to be carried out by the external 
auditor or its affiliates where such services do not present a conflict 
of interest risk in fact or in appearance. The ARC regularly reviews 
this policy for necessary changes in response to changes in related 
standards and regulatory requirements. 
This policy is designed to safeguard auditor objectivity and 
independence. It addresses the provision of audit services, audit-related 
services and other non-audit services and stipulates which services 
require specific prior approval by the ARC. 
The policy also defines prohibited services in line with applicable rules 
and regulations. Our external auditors are not allowed to provide 
prohibited services due to independence concerns. For certain non-
prohibited services, because of the knowledge and experience of the 
external auditor and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it may be more 
efficient or prudent for the external auditor to provide such services.
The ARC reviews quarterly reports from management on the audit and 
non-audit services reported in accordance with the policy or for which 
specific prior approval from the ARC is being sought. Under the AIP, no 
prior approval by the ARC is required for any additional audit service 
contract not individually exceeding $500,000. All non-audit services 
where the fee for an individual contract exceeds $100,000, including 
audit-related services, require individual prior approval by the ARC. 
For audit or non-audit service contracts that do not exceed the relevant 
threshold, the matter is approved by management by delegated 
authority from the ARC and is subsequently presented for approval by 
the ARC. The ARC is mindful of the overall proportion of fees for audit 
and non-audit services in determining whether to approve such services.
The scope of the non-audit services contracted with the external 
auditor in 2024 consisted mainly of interim reviews and other audit-
related assurance services. The associated compensation for these 
audit-related services and other non-audit services amounted to 
5% and 5%, respectively, of the external auditor's audit and
audit-related remuneration.
Fees
After due consideration, the ARC approved the auditor's remuneration, 
satisfying itself that the level of fees payable in respect of the audit and 
non-audit services provided was appropriate and that an effective, 
high-quality audit could be conducted for such fees.
 See Note 35 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 312 for details of the 
auditor's remuneration.

Directors' Remuneration Report
This report
The Directors' Remuneration Report for 2024 has been prepared 
in accordance with relevant UK corporate governance and legal 
requirements, in particular Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The Board has approved this report.
As in previous years, this report is split into three sections: Chair's letter, 
Annual Report on Remuneration and Directors' Remuneration Policy 
(Policy). The Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2023 
AGM with 94.6% support. No changes are being proposed to the 
Policy this year and it is reproduced in full on pages 208-215 for 
ease of reference, and to provide context to the decisions taken
by the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) during the year.
"2024 saw a sharpened focus on 
performance, discipline and simplification."
Neil Carson 
Chair of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholders, 
Almost two years ago, at Capital Markets Day 2023 (CMD23), 
we set out how we will deliver more value with less emissions through 
our guiding principles of performance, discipline and simplification. 
In 2024, Shell delivered another set of strong financial results, with 
income of $16.5 billion, cash flow from operations (CFFO) of $54.7 
billion, our second best year on record, and free cash flow* (FCF) 
of $39.5 billion. These results have enabled us to deliver consistent 
distributions to shareholders, while also continuing to strengthen our 
financial resilience. We set four financial targets at CMD23, and have 
made progress against each of them, including reducing structural 
costs* by $3.1 billion since 2022 and delivering total shareholder 
distributions* of 41% of CFFO for the year, at the upper end 
of the 30-40% of CFFO range set out at CMD23.
Strong operational performance across our portfolio underpinned 
our financial results. In Integrated Gas and Upstream, performance 
has increased year-on-year. At Prelude and QGC in Australia, we 
achieved record availability, resulting in our highest ever production. 
In Chemicals, utilisation improved thanks to the ramp-up of operations 
at Shell Polymers Monaca in the USA. In Marketing, we achieved the 
strongest annual Adjusted Earnings* since 2020 at $3.9 billion.
We have continued to grow our LNG portfolio and made good 
progress against the commitment to bring projects online with a total 
peak production of more than 500 thousand barrels of oil equivalent 
a day by 2025. We have also focused on high-grading our mobility 
network, increased our margins in lubricants and, when it comes 
to power generation, focused on areas where we have a 
competitive advantage.
At Shell, safety is extremely important and we continually work to keep 
our people safe. I am saddened by the tragic incidents that occurred 
at Shell-operated ventures in 2024. One person lost their life in the 
Netherlands in 2024 and another in India in 2025, following an 
incident in 2024. In late 2023, an incident occurred in Nigeria which 
resulted in a fatality in early 2024. The REMCO agreed this would be 
assessed as part of 2024's reflections on safety. The REMCO reflected 
on all three tragic incidents and Shell's broader safety performance, as 
it always does, when it determined the final pay outcomes for 2024, 
and applied downward discretion to the annual bonus outcome.
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
2024 remuneration outcomes
2024 annual bonus
The overall mathematical outcome of the annual bonus scorecard 
was above target at 1.66, adjusted to 1.64 to reflect a delayed tax 
payment due to a third-party error. After careful consideration of 
the factors leading to the tragic fatalities in respect of the year and 
reflection on Shell's overall performance in 2024, including safety 
performance, the REMCO used downward discretion to determine 
a final bonus outcome for Executive Directors of 1.61. Further 
information is on page 194.
 
See pages 193-195 for the complete scorecard with all targets, ranges and weightings, and 
a detailed discussion of performance against targets.

Vesting of the 2022 LTIP awards
Overall, the mathematical outcome of the Long-term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) was 136% of target. The REMCO was satisfied that no windfall 
gain had arisen. The REMCO also believes the vesting outcome to 
be representative of Shell's performance over the period.
 
See page 196 for full details of LTIP targets and weightings, and a discussion of performance 
against targets. 
Finalising the 2024 pay outcomes 
In finalising pay outcomes, the REMCO considered Shell's wider 
performance and context during 2024 and over the LTIP performance 
period, paying particular attention to:
￮The strong financial performance in 2024, with CFFO of 
$54.7 billion and FCF* of $39.5 billion, which has enabled Shell 
to invest in its businesses, reduce debt and enhance shareholder 
distributions.
￮ The shareholder experience, including cash dividends of $8.7 billion 
and share repurchases of $13.9 billion in 2024, resulting in total 
shareholder distributions* of $22.6 billion for the year and $71.4 
billion over the LTIP performance period (2022-2024), and absolute 
and relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance over the 
same periods.
￮ Shell's performance beyond the formulaic outcomes of the variable 
pay structures, including safety (and fatalities), reputation, ethics and 
compliance, and feedback from the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) 
and the Sustainability Committee (SUSCO).
￮ Shareholders' views on remuneration matters, as shared with the 
REMCO during engagements in March 2024, including positive 
feedback on the safety framework.
￮ The employee experience, where the REMCO noted the above-
target vesting outcome for 2024 under the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP), used to make discretionary share awards below Senior 
Executive level and the average employee salary increases. 
￮ Comparisons between the 2024 outcomes and historical 
remuneration levels.
￮ The alignment of the 10-year average outcomes of the annual 
bonus scorecard (1.13) and LTIP (96% of target) to the target level, 
demonstrating the effective design of the structures and the integrity 
of the target-setting process.
This resulted in a single figure outcome of £8.6 million for the CEO and 
£7.3 million for the CFO. The REMCO was satisfied that the shareholder-
approved Remuneration Policy had operated as intended, and these 
outcomes were appropriate in the context of Company performance 
and the target pay opportunity.
[A] Policy target and maximum based on the shareholder-approved 2023 Remuneration Policy in respect of the annual bonus and the LTIP. Salary, pension and benefits are based on latest data.
[B] Incremental remuneration in respect of 2022 for services as CEO Designate, in anticipation of becoming CEO in 2023.

2025 remuneration
2025 salaries
Effective January 1, 2025, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received 
a salary increase of 5.5%, and their salaries for 2025 are £1,535,000 
and £1,014,000, respectively. In reviewing their salaries, the REMCO 
considered carefully the external environment, including the increases 
provided to Shell's workforce in the key markets of the UK (5.5%), the 
USA (3.0%) and the Netherlands (3.6%). The Executive Directors' 
increases for 2025 were positioned in line with the average UK 
increase. The REMCO also recognised the multiplier effect on 
total remuneration.
2025 annual bonus
The REMCO is satisfied that the current mix of financial and non-
financial measures remains well aligned with Shell's strategic and 
operational priorities. No change is proposed for 2025.
2025 Performance Share Award performance conditions 
From 2025, performance-related long-term incentive awards under 
the Shell Share Plan will be referred to as Performance Share Awards 
(PSA). Other than the name, the terms and conditions of the awards 
remain unchanged. The performance conditions and weightings will 
be unchanged for the 2025 awards. The measures will be cash 
generation, TSR, organic free cash flow (OFCF) and "Shell's journey 
in the energy transition", and they will be weighted equally. Cash 
generation and TSR performance will be measured against the energy 
majors as before, and OFCF will be measured on an absolute basis 
against annual operating plans.
2026 Remuneration Policy
The current Remuneration Policy (the Policy) was last approved at the 
2023 AGM, and a new Policy will be put to a shareholder vote at the 
2026 AGM. A new Policy provides an opportunity for the REMCO to 
reflect deeply on the nature of Shell's business and how to best position 
remuneration to support Shell's strategic objectives, including CMD25. 
Deliberations on Policy design have started, with discussions around 
structure, the appropriate level of quantum, and governance. The 
REMCO intends to begin engaging with shareholders this summer.
Looking ahead
The 2025 AGM will be my last as the REMCO Chair, as I will be 
stepping down from the REMCO following the AGM. It has been 
a privilege to chair the REMCO over the past five years, and I wish 
my successor, Cyrus Taraporevala, every success for the future.
I hope that you find that this report presents a clear account of the 
REMCO's decisions for the year. I thank shareholders for their support 
and am grateful for their ongoing dialogue.

The REMCO is also responsible for determining the Chair of the 
Board's remuneration. The REMCO monitors the level and structure 
of remuneration for senior executives below Senior Management. 
When setting the Policy for Executive Director remuneration, the 
REMCO reviews and considers workforce remuneration and related 
policies, and how pay and benefits align with culture. In exercising 
its responsibilities, the REMCO takes into account a variety of 
stakeholder considerations.
The REMCO operates within its Terms of Reference, which are 
reviewed annually (last reviewed in December 2024), and are 
available on shell.com.
A perspective on Shell was provided by:
￮ Chief Executive Officer (CEO);
￮ Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer, who also acted 
as Secretary to the REMCO; and 
￮ Executive Vice President Performance and Reward.
The Chair of the Board was consulted on remuneration proposals 
affecting the CEO. The CEO was consulted on proposals relating
to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Senior Management.
The REMCO met five times in 2024 and its activities included:
￮ determining vesting of the 2021 LTIP award for Senior Management;
￮ determining 2024 target bonus opportunities and 2024 LTIP awards 
for Senior Management;
￮ setting 2024 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and 
targets;
￮ approving the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report;
￮ reviewing 2025 bonus and PSA performance measures and targets; 
￮ reviewing the Remuneration Policy ahead of renewal at the 2026

￮ engaging with major shareholders and proxy bodies on 
remuneration matters;
￮ setting exit and appointment remuneration in relation to changes 
in the Executive Committee; and
￮ monitoring external developments and assessing the impact 
on remuneration decisions.
After a competitive tender process during the year, Ellason was chosen 
to provide external advice on developments in market practice around 
remuneration. The choice of Ellason was based on its knowledge of 
investors' expectations and familiarity with UK market practices. Ellason 
is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and operates 
according to that group's code of conduct when advising clients. The 
REMCO is satisfied that the advice provided was objective and 
independent. The total fees in relation to the advice were £38,770 
(excluding value-added tax). The REMCO also reviewed market 
benchmarking data and analysis prepared by Shell's internal HR 
function on market developments in executive pay.

[A] Wael Sawan was appointed CEO and a Board Director effective January 1, 2023.
[B] Base salary: Wael Sawan's base salary for 2024 was set at £1,455,000 (+3.9% from 2023). Sinead Gorman's base salary for 2024 was set at £961,000 (+3.9% from 2023).
[C] Benefits: in respect of 2024, Wael Sawan's benefits included car allowance (£29,890) and travel-related benefits (£12,107). Sinead Gorman's benefits included car allowance (£29,890).
[D] Pension: Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received cash in lieu of pension contributions equal to 20% of base salary in 2024.
[E] Annual bonus: the full value of the bonus in respect of performance in 2024, comprising both the 50% delivered in cash and 50% bonus delivered in shares. For 2025, the market price of 
shares on February 26, 2025 for London-listed shares (£26.30) was used to determine the number of shares delivered, resulting in 29,479 ordinary shares for Wael Sawan and 19,451 
ordinary shares for Sinead Gorman, net of tax.
[F] LTIP: the amounts reported for 2024 relate to the 2022 LTIP award, which vested on March 6, 2025, at the market price of €30.74 and £25.52 for Amsterdam-listed and London-listed 
ordinary shares, respectively. The value in respect of the LTIP is calculated as the product of: (i) the number of shares of the original award multiplied by the vesting percentage, plus accrued 
dividend shares, and (ii) the market price of ordinary shares at the vesting date. The market price of the Amsterdam-listed shares is converted into GBP using the exchange rate on the vesting

Pension
During the year, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman were eligible 
to participate in the defined contribution UK Shell Pension Plan with 
an employer contribution rate of up to 20% of salary, or take this as 
a pension cash alternative. The UK Shell Pension Plan or associated 
pension cash alternative is available to new Shell employees in the 
UK at the same contribution levels and currently around two-thirds of 
UK employees participate in these arrangements. The majority of the 
remainder participate in a legacy defined benefit plan, which closed 
to new members in March 2013.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is intended to reward the delivery of short-term 
targets derived from the Operating Plan. The REMCO reviews the 
bonus measures, weightings and targets annually to evolve with Shell's 
strategy and circumstances, and to ensure that the targets remain 
stretching but realistic. For 2024, the mathematical bonus outcome 
was 1.66, adjusted to 1.64 to reflect a delayed tax payment due to 
a third-party error. The REMCO reviewed performance against the 
scorecard, as below. Further information is on page 195.
Financial delivery (35% weighting): We delivered $54.7 billion of 
CFFO against our target of $46 billion, driven by strong operational 
performance and price impact. For the purpose of the scorecard, the 
CFFO for 2024 was reduced to $54.2 billion to reflect a delayed tax 
payment due to a third-party error. As a reminder, the REMCO has a 
long-standing policy of not adjusting CFFO to take account of changes 
in energy prices and currency fluctuations. This policy supports 
alignment between pay outcomes and the shareholder experience. 
Operational excellence (35%): A key underpin of our performance, 
operational excellence ensures we deliver for our customers and drive 
financial performance:
￮Asset management excellence: Upstream controllable availability 
was outstanding, particularly in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway, 
Oman and the USA, partially offset by lower performance in the 
UK. Midstream availability was also outstanding, thanks to excellent 
performance in Australia, Qatar and Oman. Refining and Chemicals 
availability exceeded the plan, mainly due to improvements at Shell 
Polymers Monaca in the US and Bukom refinery in Singapore. 
￮ Project delivery excellence: The overall score for project delivery was 
slightly above target. Highlights for the year include the successful 
start-up of 10 projects, half of which came on-stream ahead of 
schedule. This was offset by the project delivery on budget being 
below target.
￮ Customer excellence: Customer satisfaction index was above target, 
following our focus on prioritisation and continuous improvement of 
e-commerce platforms. Our Brand share preference continued to be 
outstanding, performing ahead of target in all regions.
Overall the outcome for operational excellence was above target.

"Shell's journey in the energy transition" (15%): 
￮ LNG volumes [A]: Performance is measured based on liquefaction 
volumes. The score was above target, reflecting strong operational 
performance. This was driven mainly by volume increases in Australia 
and Atlantic LNG, partly offset by lower volumes in Nigeria and 
Egypt due to feedgas constraints.
￮ Reducing operational emissions: Performance is assessed based 
on GHG abatement projects that result in ongoing Scope 1 and 2 
emission reductions such as flare reduction and energy efficiency 
projects, site closures, decommissioning and transformations, and 
increasing the use of renewable energy in our operations. This metric 
does not include the impact of divestments and acquisitions. We had 
an outstanding outcome, with 1,028 thousand tonnes of GHG 
emission reductions from abatement, renewable energy, and 
permanent shutdowns or conversions ('right-sizing'). This was mainly 
due to catalyst improvements at Pearl GTL in Qatar, the Forcados 
Yokri Gas Project in Nigeria, and optimisation of a liquefaction 
control system at QGC in Australia.
￮ Supporting customer decarbonisation: We have continued to grow 
our network of electric vehicle charge points, exceeding our 2024 
scorecard target. In 2024, we added 19,100 charge points, which 
brings the total number to around 73,000.
[A] Equity liquefaction.
Overall the score on the "Shell's journey in the energy transition" 
measure was above target.
Safety (15%): It remains our priority to run our day-to-day operations 
safely and ensure the well-being of all our people.
￮Process safety continues to be measured through the number of
Tier 1 and 2 operational safety incidents. The score for 2024 was 
slightly ahead of target. There were 90 Tier 1 and 2 operational 
process safety events (compared with 63 in 2023).
￮ Personal safety SIF-F performance is assessed based on the number of 
serious incidents which might occur in Shell's businesses based on the 
work plan for the year and our knowledge of industry incident rates. 
Our ultimate goal is zero harm to people working for Shell. Overall, 
2024 SIF-F performance showed an improvement compared with 
2023, which is testament to the ongoing focus of our employees on 
keeping colleagues safe.
Overall, the score on the safety measure was above target. While the 
underlying safety performance was strong, we tragically lost 
colleagues during 2024. The REMCO reflected carefully on these 
events and Shell's broader safety performance and determined 
that the bonus outcome should be adjusted downwards to 1.61 
(see "The REMCO's reflections on safety" below).
The REMCO's reflections on safety
Safety is Shell's first priority and our strategy is underpinned by this. 
It is critical that our operations run safely every day and that we 
strive to ensure the well-being of all of our people.
In 2024, Shell used serious injury, illness and fatality frequency 
(SIF-F) as our scorecard measure for personal safety performance. 
SIF-F tracks the frequency at which injuries with life-changing 
consequences occur under Shell operational control. This allows us 
to focus the attention of management and the organisation on the 
most serious incidents. To be clear, our ultimate goal has been and 
remains zero harm to people.
Following discussions with shareholders in 2023, the REMCO 
adopted a discretionary framework to guide its decisions 
regarding the impact of fatalities on remuneration. The framework 
takes account of multiple reflection points, as set out below. This 
framework supports holistic and detailed consideration of the 
circumstances of each incident, and consistent and fair judgement 
of safety performance over time.
Circumstances
There were two recordable fatalities under Shell's operational 
control in respect of 2024. There was a fatal incident in the 
Netherlands at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Moerdijk in June 
2024, which remains under investigation. A colleague injured in a 
snake bite incident in India in May 2024 tragically died in January 
2025. This incident also remains under investigation. Further, in 
Nigeria, a vessel crew member who was injured in a fire incident 
in December 2023 died in February 2024. There have been no 
regulatory consequences and the outcome of the investigation 
was that the incident was not considered a repetitive failure.
Wider safety context
Safety performance has improved significantly over time. The 2024 
results support our belief that structural improvements have been 
made. The focus has continued to be on strengthening controls for 
routine activities, simplifying pre-work assessments, and leveraging 
technology for risk identification. Beyond the metrics, management 
has worked to continue to embed the Safety Refresh in Shell assets 
and businesses, and good results have been observed. There were 
no material safety events outside of the reporting framework.
Personal safety performance 2003–2024
Conclusions
The scorecard result on safety is a strong outcome which reflects 
the work throughout the organisation on the Safety Refresh, which 
promotes a learner mindset through deeper understanding of 
human performance principles and destigmatising errors. The 
sustained performance over the past few years demonstrates 
potentially lasting improvement. After careful consideration of 
Shell's holistic safety performance in 2024 including the outcome 
of the formal metrics, the in-year fatalities and the incident in 
December 2023, and Shell's long-term progress on safety, the 
REMCO has determined that the scorecard outcome for Executive 
Directors should be adjusted downwards to 1.61. The reduction in 
the bonus outcome as a result of the adjustment is equal to about 
4% of salary for both Executive Directors.
Safety incidents that occur in 2025 will be assessed as part of the 
REMCO's considerations of performance outcomes for 2025.

The table below summarises the 2024 annual bonus scorecard measures including their weightings, targets and outcomes.
 2024 annual bonus scorecard measures and weightings
[A] In determining the CFFO outcome, a discretionary adjustment was made to reflect a tax payment scheduled for the end of December 2024, which was unintendedly delayed until early 
January 2025 due to a third-party error. This has a downward impact of 0.02 on the 2024 scorecard.
[B] Upstream controllable availability: 88.0% (Threshold 82.6%, Target 84.6%, Outstanding 86.6%); Midstream availability: 91.4% (Threshold 86.1%, Target 88.1%, Outstanding 90.1%); 
Chemicals and Refinery availability: 92.1% (Threshold 90.7%, Target 91.7%, Outstanding 92.7%). Performance assessment is equally weighted between Upstream, Midstream, and 
Chemicals and Refining.
[C] Projects delivered on schedule: 81% (Threshold 40%, Target 70%, Outstanding 100%); project delivery on budget: 104% (Threshold 108%, Target 102%, Outstanding 96%). Performance 
assessment is equally weighted between projects delivered on schedule and on budget.
[D] Customer Satisfaction Index: 8.3 (Threshold 7.6, Target 8.1, Outstanding 8.6); Brand Share Preference: 15.0% (Threshold 13.1%, Target 13.7-13.8%, Outstanding 14.5%). Performance 
assessment is equally weighted between Customer Satisfaction Index and Brand Share Preference.
[E] Equity liquefaction.
Accordingly, the REMCO decided the final bonus outcome should be 161% of target and 80.5% of maximum. This results in a bonus of 
£2,925,000 for Wael Sawan and £1,930,000 for Sinead Gorman.

Long-term Incentive Plan vesting: 2022 LTIP
In 2022, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman were granted conditional share awards under the LTIP [A]. The table below summarises the 
performance conditions, weightings, targets and outcomes. 
[A] Wael Sawan was not an Executive Director at the time of the award, but his award is disclosed here for transparency. Ben van Beurden, the CEO at the time, was also granted an award 
under the LTIP in 2022. The vesting of this award is discussed in the "Payments to past Directors" section on page 202.
 
2022 LTIP vesting outcomes – performance measures
[A] TSR over the performance period was 54.6%.
The REMCO reviewed Shell's broader performance over the 
performance period, and also reflected on the share price at award 
and on vesting, noting that the share price had increased by 28% in 
respect of the CEO's award, and that appreciation accounted for 19% 
of the total value of the CEO's LTIP at vesting, and was satisfied that no 
windfall gain had arisen.
The REMCO decided that the LTIP outcome was consistent with the 
target opportunity and intended operation of the plan under the Policy 
and appropriate, and therefore no adjustment to the vesting outcome 
was required. Accordingly, the REMCO decided that the LTIP should 
vest at 136% of target (equivalent to 68% of maximum).

 Our carbon targets
In 2024, we continued on our path to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. At the end of 2024, we had reduced our Scope 1 
and 2 operational emissions by 30%, and the NCI of our energy products by 9.0% from our 2016 baseline.
[A] Average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products we sell, on an equity boundary, net of carbon credits. Estimated total GHG emissions included in NCI reflect well-to-wheel 
emissions associated with energy products sold by Shell. This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. In 
2024, we revised the 2016 baseline NCI values and other historical NCI values. As a result, the percentage reduction achieved in 2023 was revised from 6.3% to 7.7%. (See "NCI baseline 
and restatement policy" on page 98).
[B] Targets set by the REMCO. Shell continually evaluates and updates its energy transition strategy, including its interim targets.
2022 LTIP energy transition performance condition: outcome
Outcomes for the energy transition performance condition are determined by the REMCO based on quantitative performance and a qualitative 
assessment focused on Shell's short-term NCI reduction target and those elements that we understood at the time would make the most impact 
on achieving our goals over the three-year performance period relating to NCI: the growth of our power business, the growth of lower-carbon 
products, and the development of systems to absorb, capture and store carbon. This approach to the LTIP is intended to support experimentation 
and learning as to what actions will help deliver net-zero emissions in a profitable way. Accordingly, the REMCO uses the performance indicators 
as guidance, rather than applying a formulaic vesting outcome, when making its decisions.
 
Net carbon intensity (NCI) -- performance indicator met
We achieved our short-term target for the 2022-2024 LTIP cycle to reduce our NCI by 9-12% compared with the 2016 baseline, with a 9.0% 
reduction by 2024, demonstrating strong year-on-year progress towards our longer-term targets. In making its decision, the REMCO reviewed how 
the target was met including changing product sales mix, the use of emission offsets, such as carbon credits, and the retirement of Renewable Energy 
Certificates, recognising the importance of these in the energy transition.
Growing the power business -- performance indicator met
A key element of the early cycles of the LTIP was to encourage learning about how to profitably decarbonise and the REMCO paid close attention 
to how management has refined the strategy for renewable power generation, energy marketing, and gas and power trading over the performance 
period. The emphasis has changed from a focus on growing the customer base and creating renewable generation capacity to a capital-light, sales-
led strategy focusing on the Trading and Energy Marketing business as drivers of value creation. We are applying a more selective and disciplined 
approach to investment, prioritising investments that enable our trading and optimisation capabilities, especially in the area of flexible power 
management. Shell has further developed its marketing (B2B) and power trading businesses in key markets in Europe, the USA, Australia and Brazil 
over the performance cycle. This focus has also seen Shell divest its consumer power retail business in Europe and step back from renewable power 
generation opportunities that no longer fit our strategy or deliver sufficient returns. In considering the vesting outcome, the REMCO noted the work 
done to pivot the renewable generation, energy marketing, and gas and power trading strategy to deliver value for shareholders, the steps taken to 
bring renewable electrons to market, as well as the outcomes of 306 TWh/yr of total power sales achieved against an original target of 310-380 
TWh/yr, of which 21% was renewable power (target 21%-31%), and considered the target as met.
Growing new lower-carbon product offerings -- performance indicator partially met
Shell is one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels and is continuing to invest in low- and zero-carbon products such as 
hydrogen and biofuels, working closely with customers to identify the products they need to decarbonise. Metrics for the performance cycle were 
designed to encourage development across this range of offerings, with ambitious targets set for developing advanced biofuels and hydrogen. For 
advanced biofuels, the REMCO originally set a target of investment in five or six advanced biofuels projects by the end of the performance period. 
While two were achieved, the pipeline of opportunities did not convert into commercially viable projects as technology derisking proved costly and 
demand for these products did not materialise as expected. Shell continues to invest in new technologies, but with discipline and a focus on the most 
viable markets to ensure we deliver value for shareholders. The decision to pause on-site construction work at the biofuel facility at the Shell Energy 
and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (the Netherlands) is a reminder of the importance of ensuring we get the basics right. On hydrogen, the REMCO 
originally set a target of 750 MW of capacity to be achieved by the end of the performance period. The Holland Hydrogen I (the Netherlands) 
and Refhyne II (Germany) projects together provide 300 MW of production capacity and are important platforms for future hydrogen development. 
This is below the 750 MW target; however, in taking a balanced view on the outcome, the REMCO considered this a good result as the regulatory 
frameworks and business models for hydrogen continue to develop. An important element of the REMCO's deliberations has been reflection on the 
fact that the policy environment and market for many of these offerings are emerging more slowly than anticipated, which speaks to the overall 
pace of the energy transition. The REMCO needs therefore to find the right balance between holding management accountable to targets versus 
supporting commercial decision-making to ensure shareholder value creation. Overall, the REMCO assessed the outcome on this metric as 
partially met.

---- Page 200 ----
Develop emission sinks -- performance indicator partially met
The development of systems that capture and store or absorb carbon is required as part of the global response to climate change to reduce and 
compensate for emissions where there are not currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. The REMCO originally set a target of 25-30 mtpa CO2e 
offset by carbon credits through carbon-neutral customer offerings. The outcome was 2 mtpa, as low customer demand and also operational 
challenges contributed to a target miss on this sub-metric. Technologies related to carbon capture and storage are necessary to reduce emissions 
where there are few low-carbon alternatives and a target of four-five was also set for maturing CCS projects. This was achieved with four projects: 
Northern Lights Phase 1B (Norway), Porthos (the Netherlands), where Shell is a launch customer, Polaris, and Atlas (both Canada). The REMCO 
considered this a positive result and evidence of Shell developing the organisational capability to develop this type of large-scale project, which 
will play an important role in Shell decarbonising its operations. The REMCO considered the overall outcome on this metric to be partially met.
Overall, the REMCO determined that the energy transition measure (accounting for 20% of the award) should vest at 130% of target.
Consideration of 2024 single figure outcomes
In determining the final single figure outcomes for 2024, the REMCO also considered the personal performance of the Executive Directors.
 Personal performance 
2024 was another year of strong and decisive leadership from the 
Executive Directors. A key deliverable for the year was the Energy 
Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24), published in March 2024, setting 
out the important role Shell intends to play in providing the energy 
the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy 
system of the future. The Executive Directors played a pivotal role in 
the shaping of the strategy, and communicating it to our shareholders 
and other key stakeholders. The resolution was supported by 78% of 
shareholders who voted through an advisory vote at the 2024 AGM.
Performance, discipline and simplification continued to be our guiding 
principles during 2024, and the Executive Directors have modelled 
these values in their leadership, improving how we work across 
the organisation. Key successes are noted throughout this report, 
particularly on page 193 on the 2024 annual bonus and page 196 
on the 2022 LTIP vesting outcome, and additional comments are 
provided below.
Wael Sawan has steered Shell through another successful year. The 
focus has been on delivering against the financial and climate targets 
set out at Capital Markets Day 2023 (CMD23), establishing a track 
record in consistently meeting our external commitments. In Integrated 
Gas and Upstream, we have seen improvement in operational 
performance and the successful start to a number of projects. In 
Downstream and Renewable Energy Solutions, there has been 
continuous high-grading of the portfolio to support a profitable energy 
transition. Wael Sawan has demonstrated clear and decisive 
leadership, driving growth where we have a competitive advantage, 
and making tough decisions to pause and address performance 
challenges where needed (for example, pausing the biofuels project 
in the Netherlands). By the end of 2024, key achievements included:
￮delivery against CMD23 commitments, including total shareholder 
distributions* in 2024 of 41% of CFFO ($22.6 billion), at the upper 
end of the promised 30-40% of CFFO through the cycle, and 
structural cost reduction* of $3.1 billion since 2022 against the 
commitment of $2-3 billion by the end of 2025;
￮ continued high-grading of the portfolio, including agreement to 
sell our Energy and Chemicals Park in Singapore and our Nigerian 
onshore subsidiary, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of 
Nigeria Limited (SPDC);
￮ delivery of improved operational performance, including Prelude 
significantly increasing its controllable availability since its 
turnaround last year;
￮ final investment decisions made across a number of low-carbon 
projects, including the Polaris and Atlas (Phase 1) CCS projects 
in Canada, and the hydrogen project Refhyne II in Germany;
￮ continuing Shell's role in shaping the broader energy conversation 
through engagements at events including CERAWeek, ROG.e, 
ADIPEC, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies;
￮ continued focus on safety and climate performance, including the 
achievement of a 30% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 operational 
emissions, and a 9.0% reduction in NCI vs. the 2016 baseline; and
￮ driving Shell's performance, discipline and simplification, growing 
business empowerment across all organisational levels.
Working closely with the CEO, Sinead Gorman has continued to 
demonstrate her skills as a leader, helping to drive a high-performance 
culture and a learner mindset. The year is characterised by strong 
financial results, a healthy balance sheet and capital discipline. 
Sinead Gorman has steered the Finance function's disciplined capital 
stewardship and effective management of Shell's financial framework, 
allowing Shell to meet its organisational objectives and commitments 
to shareholders. By the end of 2024, Sinead Gorman's key 
achievements included:
￮together with the CEO, delivery of strong financial results with net 
income of $16.5 billion, Adjusted Earnings* of $23.7 billion, and 
CFFO of $54.7 billion, our second best year on record, against plan 
target of $46 billion;
￮ strengthening the balance sheet by reducing net debt* to $38.8 
billion, and enhancing the resilience of the Company;
￮ playing a critical role in shaping ETS24, securing the advisory vote 
from shareholders in support of this strategy at the 2024 AGM;
￮ continuing to drive capital discipline, with cash capital expenditure 
in 2024 below the target range for the year and creating a culture 
in which a focus on value creation is central; and
￮ continued focus on climate performance, including the achievement 
of a 30% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions, and a 
9.0% reduction in NCI vs. the 2016 baseline.

The REMCO also considered a range of other factors in finalising 
its remuneration decisions for 2024, including:
￮Shell's performance in 2024 and over the LTIP performance period 
2022-2024, and the formulaic outcomes of the bonus and the LTIP 
performance conditions;
￮ the impact of fatalities on the formulaic scorecard outcome;
￮ absolute and relative TSR performance over the period;
￮ a range of factors that take account of Shell's performance beyond 
the formulaic outcomes of the variable pay structures, including 
safety, reputation, ethics and compliance, and feedback from 
the ARC and SUSCO; and
￮ the external environment and wider stakeholder experience, 
including shareholders' expectations with regard to executive 
pay decision-making and the employee experience;
￮ the Executive Directors' remuneration compared with the 
variable pay outcomes for the general workforce;
￮ the alignment of the Executive Directors with the shareholder 
experience through their high shareholding requirements; and
￮ the Executive Directors' remuneration compared with 
historical outcomes.
After reflecting on the above factors, the REMCO was satisfied with 
the single figure outcomes for the CEO and the CFO.
Malus and clawback
No malus or clawback provisions were applied during 2024.
2024 LTIP
 Scheme interests awarded to Executive Directors in 2024 (audited)
In 2024, the Executive Directors were awarded conditional share awards under the LTIP as set out in the table below. In approving the awards, 
the REMCO considered Shell's historical share price, including the share price over the prior year, and noted that the share price at award was in 
line with that in 2023 and was higher than average historical levels. The REMCO determined that the risk of windfall gain was limited, 
and therefore no adjustment was made to the award size.

[A] The awards for both Executive Directors were made based on the closing market price on the date of award, February 2, 2024, for ordinary shares of £24.72.
[B] Minimum performance relates to the lowest level of achievement, for which there is no vesting.
The performance conditions and weightings applying to LTIP awards 
made in 2024 were: relative cash generation (25% weighting), relative 
TSR (25%), absolute OFCF (25%), and energy transition (25%).
Relative performance conditions
The relative performance conditions are based on our performance on 
key financial and external measures against our closest comparators. 
Cash generation is defined as CFFO divided by average capital 
employed, and measures Shell's ability to generate the top-line cash 
flow to finance investment in our business and shareholder distributions.
TSR measures actual value created for shareholders (i.e. change in 
share price plus dividends) and, as in prior years, is calculated in US 
dollars using a 90-day averaging period.
Vesting under each relative performance condition is assessed 
independently, with the vesting outcome ranging from 0% to 200% 
of the target award in respect of the measure, in accordance with 
the following vesting schedule:
￮ranking first equals 200% vesting;
￮ ranking second equals 150% vesting;
￮ ranking third equals 80% vesting; and
￮ ranking fourth or fifth equals 0% vesting.
Outperforming Shell's closest competitors on key financial metrics is 
challenging. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median performance 
is generally set at a limit of 25% of maximum for other UK companies, 
but notes that this is typically applied against a larger comparator 
group. A vesting outcome of 80% for median performance (40% of 
maximum) in a small comparator group is considered appropriate 
by the REMCO.

Absolute measures
Organic free cash flow (OFCF)
The OFCF performance condition supports the delivery of our cash 
flow priorities, which are to service and reduce debt, pay dividends, 
buy back shares and make future capital investments. 
The performance targets for OFCF are set by reference to Shell's 
annual operating plans, based on the sum of plan OFCF targets over 
the three-year performance period, and updating the plan each year 
to reflect a changing price premise. The REMCO has a long-standing 
no-adjustments policy, and believes it is more appropriate to set the 
target based on the aggregation of the annual operating plans rather 
than setting a three-year target at the outset and making necessary 
adjustments at the end. OFCF targets are disclosed retrospectively 
and in aggregate, following the conclusion of the three-year period.
Under the OFCF performance condition, achievement of threshold 
performance will result in 40% of the target award (20% of maximum) 
in respect of the OFCF vesting, increasing to full vesting for achievement 
of outstanding performance. A straight-line vesting schedule will 
apply for performance between threshold and outstanding.
Energy transition
For the 2024 award, the REMCO's determination of the extent to 
which awards will vest will be based on its holistic assessment of 
progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and 
supporting customers to reduce their emissions. For more information, 
see the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report. The key factors in the 
REMCO's decision will be disclosed at the end of the performance 
period (unless commercially sensitive).
 
For information on Shell's energy transition, see the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 on 
shell.com.
Performance update on OFCF
2023 LTIP award 
At December 31, 2024, OFCF* performance was above target, 
with a strong outcome of $35.9 billion for 2023 (target $22.0 billion), 
and $37.5 billion for 2024 (target $24.0 billion). As one year of OFCF 
performance remains, and 75% of the award is subject to relative 
and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect 
the potential vesting of the award.
2024 LTIP award 
At December 31, 2024, OFCF* performance was above target, based 
on $37.5 billion for 2024 (target $24.0 billion). As two years of OFCF 
performance remain, and 75% of the award is subject to relative 
and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect 
the potential vesting of the award.

[A] UK regulations require the inclusion of benefits where these would be taxable in the UK, on the assumption that Directors are tax residents in the UK. On this premise, the taxable benefits 
include the cost of a Non-executive Director's occasional business-required partner travel. Shell also pays for travel between home and the head office, where Board and committee meetings 
are typically held, and related hotel and subsistence costs. For consistency, business expenses for travel between home and the head office are not reported as taxable benefits because for 
most Non-executive Directors this is international travel and hence would not be taxable in the UK. 
[B] Fees disclosed are those in respect of 2024, of which £12,000 was paid in 2025.

Statement of Directors' shareholding and share
interests (audited)
Shareholding guidelines
The REMCO believes that Executive Directors should align their 
interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in Shell plc.
Only unfettered shares count towards an Executive Director's 
shareholding. Shares delivered that are subject to holding requirements 
also count towards the guidelines. The CEO and the CFO have five 
years from their respective appointment to the Board to achieve their 
respective shareholding requirements.
There is a Company-sponsored nominee account for each employee 
which allows for restrictions to be applied on the sale or transfer of 
shares that are subject to holding periods. The restrictions remain 
in force beyond the Executive Director's employment.
 
See page 210 for further details of the shareholding guidelines.
Directors' share interests 
The interests, in shares of the Company or calculated equivalents, 
of the Directors in office during 2024, including any interests of 
their connected persons, are set out in the table below.

[A] Includes unvested long-term incentive awards and notional dividend shares accrued at December 31, 2024. Interests are shown on the basis of the original awards, which can vest at between 
0% and 200% based on performance. Dividend shares accumulate each year on an assumed notional LTIP award. Such dividend shares are disclosed and recorded on the basis of the 
number of shares conditionally awarded but, when an award vests, dividend shares will be awarded only in relation to vested shares as if the vested shares were held from the award date.

[G] Held as 5,000 ADS.
The changes to Directors' shareholdings as at March 7, 2025,
are as follows:
￮Wael Sawan's share interest increased by 108,275 ordinary shares 
after the delivery of the 2024 annual bonus shares and the vesting 
of the 2022 LTIP award; and
￮ Sinead Gorman's share interest increased by 105,341 ordinary 
shares after the delivery of the 2024 annual bonus shares and the 
vesting of the 2022 LTIP award. 
At March 7, 2025, the Directors and Senior Management (pages 
152 and 157) of the Company beneficially owned, individually and in 
aggregate (including shares under option), less than 1% of Company 
shares. These shareholdings are not considered sufficient to affect
the independence of the Directors.

Dilution
In any 10-year period, no more than 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under executive 
(discretionary) share plans adopted by the Company, or 10% when 
aggregated with awards under any other employee share plan 
operated by the Company. To date, no shareholder dilution has 
resulted from these plans, although it is permitted under the rules
of the plans, subject to these limits.
Payments for loss of office
There were no payments for loss of office to Executive Directors 
in 2024 (audited). During 2024, the former Company Secretary 
received €1,040,470 gross in voluntary severance payment, in 
line with local Dutch policy.
Payments to past Directors (audited)
Former CEO Ben van Beurden received an LTIP award of 209,131 
ordinary shares in 2022, which has been pro-rated. The pro-rated 
award vested at 136% of target based on performance to December 
31, 2024. Therefore, 161,777 ordinary shares (including accrued 
dividends) vested on March 6, 2025, with a value at vesting of 
£4,128,548. A three-year holding period applies, which remains in 
force after termination. In respect of 2024, Ben van Beurden also 
received taxable benefits totalling £18,532, including £8,362 in gross-
up costs.
Former CFO Jessica Uhl received taxable benefits of £38,046 in 
respect of 2024, the majority of which related to gross-up costs.
Payments below £5,000 are not reported as they are considered 
de minimis.

Percentage change in remuneration of the Directors and employees
The table below compares the remuneration of the Executive and Non-executive Directors of Shell plc with an employee comparator group 
consisting of local employees in the UK, the USA and the Netherlands. The local employee population of these countries is considered to be a 
suitable employee comparator group because: these are countries with a significant Shell employee base; a large proportion of senior managers 
come from these countries; and the REMCO considers remuneration levels in these countries when setting base salaries for Executive Directors. 
For the purposes of comparison, the change in employee remuneration is calculated by reference to the change in salary scale, benefits and 
annual bonus for a notional employee in each of the base countries, not by reference to the actual change in pay for a group of employees.
Taxable benefits are those that align with the definition of taxable benefits applying in the respective country. In line with the "Single figure of total 
remuneration for Executive Directors" table, the annual bonus is included in the year in which it was earned (rather than paid).

[A] Shell has chosen to use option A (as defined in UK reporting regulations) to calculate 
the CEO pay ratio in accordance with guidance from the UK government that this is the 
preferred approach and the most statistically accurate method for identifying the ratios. 
Under option A, a comparable single figure for all UK employees has been calculated in 
order to identify the employees whose pay and benefits are at the 25
th
, 50
th
 (median) and 
75
th
 percentiles for comparison with the CEO. Employee pay has been calculated based 
on the total pay and benefits paid in respect of 2024 for all employees who were 
employed on December 31, 2024. For part-time workers and joiners in the year, pay and 
benefits have been annualised based on the proportion of their working time in the UK 
during the year. This is calculated with an approach consistent with the methodology for 
determining annual bonuses. The REMCO believes that this provides a fair and reasonable 
calculation of the pay ratios for Shell employees in the UK.
The ratio of the CEO's pay to the median UK employee is 61. The ratio 
at median for 2024 is higher than for 2023, reflecting higher variable 
pay outcomes. While variable pay outcomes have also increased for 
other UK employees, a higher proportion of the CEO's remuneration is 
variable, meaning the pay ratio is higher in years of higher variable 
pay outcomes. The REMCO believes the CEO pay ratio for 2024 is 
consistent with Shell's philosophy of pay for performance.
Directors' employment arrangements and letters 
of appointment
Executive Directors are employed for an indefinite period. Non-
executive Directors, including the Chair, have letters of appointment. 
Details of Executive Directors' employment arrangements can be 
found in the Policy on pages 213-214.
 
Further details of Non-executive Directors' terms of appointment can be found in the 
"Other regulatory and statutory information" on page 223 and the "Governance 
framework" report on page 159.
Compensation of Directors and Senior Management
During the year ended December 31, 2024, Shell paid and/or accrued 
compensation totalling $46 million (2023: $57 million) to Directors 
and Senior Management for services in all capacities while serving 
as a Director or member of Senior Management, including $2 million 
(2023: $2 million) accrued to provide pension, retirement and similar 
benefits. The amounts stated are those recognised in Shell's income 
attributable to Shell plc shareholders on an IFRS basis. See Note 34 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements". Personal loans or 
guarantees were not provided to Directors or Senior Management.
Workforce engagement on remuneration matters
Workforce engagement
Our employees are fundamental to our success. Fostering a 
collaborative culture and reinforcing a learner mindset is central 
to delivering our strategy. The Board's view is that all Directors 
have a collective responsibility for workforce engagement, ensuring 
that employees' voices are heard on all business matters, including 
pay, and that the Company communicates effectively to employees 
on our remuneration policies and practices.
The Board and management regularly engage with the workforce 
through a range of formal and informal channels. These include 
webcasts and all-employee messages from our CEO and other senior 
leaders; town halls and team meetings; virtual coffee connects; 
interviews with senior management; internal social platforms; and 
focused engagements. During interactive sessions, employees have 
the opportunity to ask about any topic, including pay. The Board's 
preference is to build on existing, long-standing channels of 
engagement for discussions around remuneration. During the 
year, management engaged with the workforce on what the 
2024 performance metrics meant for each of us, giving employees 
the opportunity to ask any questions on this topic. We also conduct 
annual employee surveys; further information is on page 117.
Wider employee context
The REMCO receives annual updates on workforce remuneration 
topics, including employees' views on pay matters; CEO pay ratio; 
workforce reward philosophy and principles; alignment of Shell values 
and behaviours with remuneration practices; and general employee 
salary planning and variable pay outcomes, taking into account the 
cost of living environment and the impact of this on our colleagues. The 
REMCO is also periodically updated on wider employee matters such 
as the UK gender and ethnicity pay gap analyses. In this way, the 
REMCO is able to satisfy itself that reward across Shell is aligned 
to our strategy, culture, and long-term sustainable success.

---- Page 207 ----
Shell adheres to its fair pay principles in all remuneration-related 
matters. Pay in Shell is market-competitive, free from bias, and provides 
security to our employees. Shell sets clear performance expectations, 
gives employees the opportunity to share in Shell's success through 
a variety of variable pay schemes, and is transparent and clear in 
its communication of remuneration. For more information, visit the 
"Careers" section of shell.com.
How executive remuneration aligns with wider Company pay policy
Executive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with the structures for the broader workforce, as set out in the table below.
 
Element Comparison of Executive Director and wider workforce arrangements
Salary The Executive Directors' salaries are reviewed with reference to the factors set out in the Policy, against defined comparator groups. The market-
competitiveness of wider workforce salaries is assessed at a base country level.
Pension and 
benefits
The Executive Directors' pension benefits are aligned with those offered to employees who joined Shell from 2013 onwards in the UK. Shell does not 
operate separate executive pension arrangements. All Group employees participate in the relevant pension plan for their base country based on their 
date of joining.
The Executive Directors are eligible to receive the same benefits available to the broader workforce.
Annual
bonus
The Group scorecard applicable to Group employees is identical to that applicable to Executive Directors in terms of performance measures, 
weightings and targets. For the wider workforce, an additional multiplier applies based on individual performance during the year. No individual 
multiplier applies to Executive Directors, and further, 50% of the bonus is paid in shares, and the bonus is subject to malus and clawback provisions.
Long-term 
incentives
In 2025, Executive Directors and around 120 senior executives received Performance Share Awards (PSA) on the same terms. Executive Directors' 
awards are subject to a three-year holding period. Around 12,000 employees received a mix of PSAs and Restricted Share Awards, with the split based 
on seniority. Further information is on page 119.
Shareholding 
guidelines
The Executive Directors have the highest shareholding guidelines in the Company, which are set at 700% and 500% of salary for the CEO and the 
CFO, respectively. These guidelines continue post termination for a period of two years.
Shareholding guidelines extend into the organisation to senior manager level. Employees are required to achieve their individual guideline within a 
specified timeframe, as is the case for Executive Directors.
Statement of planned implementation of Policy in 2025
A summary of how the shareholder-approved Policy will be applied to 
Directors' remuneration for 2025 is set out below.
Executive Directors
Comparator group
The benchmarking comparator group for 2025 remains consistent with 
that used in prior years, and consists of other oil majors (bp, Chevron, 
ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies) and a selection of major Europe-based 
companies. The oil majors are included in the comparator group as 
these represent our closest direct competitors operating in similar 
market conditions. The Europe-based companies are selected based 
on their size, complexity and global reach. The REMCO retains the 
right to alter the comparator group as it sees fit to ensure it remains 
an appropriate and relevant benchmark.

Salaries
Effective January 1, 2025, Wael Sawan and Sinead Gorman received 
a salary increase of 5.5%, and salaries for 2025 are £1,535,000 and 
£1,014,000, respectively.
In reviewing the Executive Directors' salaries, the REMCO carefully 
considered the external environment, and the increases provided to the 
Shell workforce in the key markets of the UK (5.5%), the USA (3.0%) 
and the Netherlands (3.6%). The Executive Directors' increases for 
2025 were positioned in line with other UK employees and the 
REMCO recognised the multiplier effect on total remuneration. 
Executive Directors' salary increases for 2024 were positioned 
below that for other UK employees.
Annual bonus
The REMCO reviewed the bonus scorecard during the year and 
considered that it remained well aligned with our strategic and 
operational priorities. There are no changes for 2025, except that 
the personal safety metric will be renamed fatality and permanent 
impairment, replacing serious injury, illness and fatality frequency. This 
is part of Shell's commitment to transition to industry standards defined 
by the industry association, International Oil & Gas Producers. The 
scope and definition of the metric remain unchanged.
Some shareholders have commented on the use of LNG in the energy 
transition performance measure in the bonus. The REMCO reviewed 
this matter during the year. LNG has a critical role to play in Shell's 
energy transition strategy by producing less carbon emissions than coal 
when used to generate electricity, helping to maintain grid stability as 
the share of renewable energy grows, increasingly powering transport 
and shipping, and providing energy security in the coming decades. 
Therefore, the REMCO believes it is important that LNG is 
appropriately captured in the scorecard.

Performance Share Awards
On January 31, 2025, Performance Share Awards (PSA) were made 
to the Executive Directors resulting in 162,964 Shell plc shares being 
awarded to Wael Sawan and 96,871 to Sinead Gorman. The awards 
had a face value of 300% (maximum performance outcome 600%) of 
salary for Wael Sawan and 270% (maximum performance outcome 
540%) of salary for Sinead Gorman, excluding potential share price 
appreciation and dividends. The 2025 PSAs to Executive Directors are 
based on salaries as at December 31 of the prior year, consistent with 
the rest of the organisation. 
The REMCO reviewed the award levels in the context of share price 
movement over the year prior to award, and determined that the risk 
of windfall gain was limited and therefore no adjustment was made.
Performance is measured over the three-year period January 1, 2025, 
to December 31, 2027. The performance measures, weightings and 
link to strategy for the 2025 award are set out on this page.

Performance framework for the 2025 PSA "Shell's journey
in the energy transition" performance condition
The REMCO's determination of the vesting outcome will be based 
on its holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from 
our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. 
This will be based on our journey to net-zero climate targets for our 
own operations of:
￮halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control 
on a net basis (2016 baseline); 
￮ eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [A]; 
and 
￮ maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving 
near-zero methane emissions by 2030 [B]. 
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased 
routine flaring. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed 
the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[B] On an intensity basis.

The REMCO will also take account of progress in developments 
that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the 
development of our Power business (including renewables), lower-
carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and CCS. 
We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% 
reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline), a 15-20% reduction in 
customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 
baseline) [A], as well as Shell's wider performance in accelerating 
the energy transition, e.g. demonstrating leadership and advocacy 
in standard setting, alongside any other factors that the REMCO 
considers relevant.
[A] This ambition was set in March 2024. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products 
(Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes 
CO2e in 2021.
The REMCO will provide a full disclosure of all material factors, both 
quantitative and qualitative, that it took into account in reaching the 
vesting decision.
Malus and clawback
The annual bonus is subject to malus provisions before it is delivered, 
and to clawback thereafter for a period of three years. The PSA is 
subject to malus provisions before vesting, and to clawback provisions 
thereafter for a period of three years. Shell's chosen malus and 
clawback periods align with the performance and holding periods, 
respectively, for simplicity. A full description of the circumstances 
under which malus and clawback might be applied to a variable 
pay award is set out in the Policy.
Pension
There are no changes to pension benefits for 2025.
Benefits 
Executive Directors are provided with a chauffeured car for business 
travel, including home-to-office commuting. Other benefits, such as 
medical and other risk benefits are in line with those provided to 
the general workforce.

Directors' Remuneration Policy
 
The Directors' Remuneration Policy sets out:
￮ A summary of shareholder-approved changes to the 
Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 208.
￮ Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 209.
￮ Non-executive Directors' Remuneration Policy, page 214.
This section describes the Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Policy) 
which, following shareholder approval at the 2023 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), came into effect from May 23, 2023, and will 
be effective until the 2026 AGM, unless a revised Policy is proposed 
by the Company and approved by shareholders in the meantime.
The principles underpinning the REMCO's approach to executive 
remuneration are the foundation for everything we do and are:
￮Alignment with Shell's strategy and sustainability: the Executive 
Directors' compensation package should promote the long-term, 
sustainable success of Shell, and be strongly linked to the 
achievement of stretching targets that are indicators of the
execution of Shell's strategy. 
￮ Pay for performance: the majority of the Executive Directors' 
compensation, (excluding benefits and pensions), should be linked 
directly to Shell's performance through variable pay instruments. 
￮ Competitiveness: remuneration levels should be determined by 
reference internally against Shell's Senior Management and 
externally against companies of comparable size, complexity
and global scope. 
￮ Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should 
align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares
in Shell.
￮ Consistency: the remuneration structure for Executive Directors 
should generally be consistent with the remuneration structure for 
Shell's Senior Management. This consistency builds a culture of 
alignment with Shell's purpose and a common approach to sharing 
in Shell's success.
￮ Risk assessment: decisions should be made in the context of the Shell 
General Business Principles and Code of Conduct. The remuneration 
structures and rewards should meet risk assessment tests to ensure 
that shareholders' interests are safeguarded and that inappropriate 
actions are avoided.
The Executive Directors' remuneration structure is made up of a fixed 
element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus 
(50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). 
Variable pay outcomes are conditional on the successful execution of 
the Operating Plan in the short term, and the delivery of strategic goals 
and financial and share price outperformance over the longer term.
The award of shares under the bonus and LTIP, along with significant 
shareholding requirements, are intended to ensure executives have a 
sizeable shareholding in the Company and experience the same 
outcomes as our shareholders.
During 2022, the REMCO reviewed the Policy to ensure that it 
continued to support Shell's strategy. The REMCO determined that 
the 2020 Policy remained appropriate in most respects, and required 
changes only to reflect the transition of our Executive Directors to the 
UK to align with market practice and for simplification. For each area 
of the Policy, the REMCO reviewed the alignment with strategy, market 
practice, the corporate governance environment, and feedback from 
shareholders, and additionally spent time updating the selection 
and calibration of performance metrics in variable pay schemes. Any 
potential conflict of interest was mitigated by the independence of the 
REMCO members and the REMCO Terms of Reference. The REMCO 
also considered the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
when reviewing the Policy, and sought to reflect the principles of clarity, 
simplicity, risk management, predictability, proportionality and 
alignment with culture.
A comparison of the 2023 and 2020 Policies is set out below.

Purpose and link to strategy Maximum opportunity Operation and performance measurement
Base salary
Provides a fixed level of earnings to 
attract and retain Executive 
Directors.
£2,000,000 Reviewed annually with adjustments effective from January 1.
In making salary determinations, the REMCO will consider:
￮ the market positioning of the compensation packages;
￮ comparison with Senior Management salaries; 
￮ the employee context, and planned average salary increase for other employees 
across the UK, the Netherlands and the USA;
￮ the experience, skills and performance of the Executive Director, or any change in the 
scope and responsibility of their role;
￮ general economic conditions, Shell's financial performance and governance trends; 
and
￮ the impact of salary increases on pension benefits and other elements of the package.
Benefits
Provides benefits, typically in line 
with those applicable to the wider 
workforce, in order to attract and 
retain Executive Directors.
Determined by the nature of the 
benefit itself and costs of provision, 
and may depend on external 
factors, such as insurance costs.
Typical benefits include car allowances, home-to-office transport, risk benefits (for 
example ill health, disability or death-in-service), security provision, and employer 
contributions to insurance plans (such as medical) including Directors' liability insurance. 
In the event an international relocation is required either prior to appointment or while 
appointed, Shell's mobility policies may apply and the REMCO may offer appropriate 
provisions in respect of items including, but not limited to, relocation, assistance with 
visa/immigration/tax issues, and tax return support. It may also provide housing and 
education assistance for a specified period of time, expected to be no more than two 
years. Tax equalisation related to expatriate employment prior to Board appointment, 
or in other limited circumstances to offset double taxation, may also be provided.
Precise benefits will depend on the Executive Director's specific circumstances and may 
include any tax liabilities relating to business-related benefits such as in the case of 
security or relocation provisions. 
The REMCO may adjust the range and scope of the benefits offered in the context of 
developments for other employees in the country which the Executive Director is based. 
Personal loans or guarantees are not provided to Executive Directors.
Pension
Provides a competitive defined 
contribution pension provision 
applicable to the wider workforce 
in the UK to attract and retain 
Executive Directors.
Determined by the rules of the 
defined contribution UK pension 
arrangements.
Executive Directors' retirement benefits are maintained in line with those of the wider 
Shell workforce in the UK. Only base salary is pensionable, unless plan regulations 
specify otherwise and cannot legally be disapplied. The rules of the relevant plan detail 
the pension benefits which members can receive. The REMCO retains the right to amend 
the form of any Executive Director's pension arrangements where appropriate, for 
example in response to changes in legislation to ensure the original objective of this 
element of remuneration is preserved.
New Executive Directors based in the UK, whether internal appointees or external hires, 
will be provided with the defined contribution arrangement, applicable to the wider Shell 
workforce in the UK, which currently includes the flexibility to take this as a pension cash 
alternative.
Annual bonus
Rewards the delivery of short-term 
operational targets as derived from 
Shell's Operating Plan.
Aligns the interests of Executive 
Directors and shareholders, and 
supports retention, through long-
term holding in shares.
Target bonus: 125% of 
base salary.
Maximum bonus: 200% 
of target.
￮ The bonus is determined by reference to performance from January 1 to December 31 
each year.
￮ Annual bonus = base salary x target bonus % x scorecard result (0–2).
￮ The scorecard is reviewed each year, taking account of Shell's operating plan, to 
ensure that the performance measures, targets and weightings are appropriate. 
Performance measures typically relate to financial delivery, operational excellence, 
progress in the energy transition, and safety, with indicative weightings of 35%, 35%, 
15% and 15% respectively. This helps to balance short-term financial performance with 
the achievement of a broader set of strategic and operational objectives to support 
long-term shareholder value creation. The REMCO retains the flexibility to adjust 
performance measures, weightings and targets on a year-by-year basis, within the 
terms of the Policy.
￮ Scorecard targets are disclosed on a retrospective basis in a subsequent Annual 
Report on Remuneration, when they are no longer deemed commercially sensitive.
￮ To reinforce alignment with shareholder interests, 50% of any bonus earned is 
delivered in cash and 50% is delivered in net-of-tax shares. The shares are subject to 
a three-year holding period from the end of the performance period the award relates 
to, which applies beyond an Executive Director's tenure. The REMCO retains 
discretion to waive any part of this holding period in exceptional circumstances 
(primarily death).
￮ The bonus is subject to malus provisions before it is delivered, and to clawback 
thereafter for a period of three years.

Target award: 300% of base salary. 
Awards may vest at up to 200% of 
the shares originally awarded, plus 
dividends.
￮ Award levels are determined in respect of any financial year by the REMCO 
within the Policy maximum.
￮ Awards may vest at between 0% and 200% of the initial award, depending 
on Shell's performance, assessed over a three-year performance period, 
on an absolute basis and/or on a relative basis against an appropriate 
comparator group.
￮ Performance measures and weightings are reviewed and set by the REMCO at 
the beginning of each three-year performance period, taking account of Shell's 
strategic priorities. 
￮ Notional dividends accrue over the vesting period in respect of awards that vest.
￮ To reinforce alignment with shareholder interests, net of tax shares delivered from 
vested awards are subject to a three-year holding period from the end of the 
performance period the award relates to, which applies beyond an Executive 
Director's tenure. The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of this holding 
period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).
￮ Dividends accrue over the vesting period in respect of awards that vest.
￮ The award is subject to malus provisions before vesting, and to clawback 
provisions thereafter for a period of three years.
Discretion, malus and clawback
Enables the management of risks 
from behaviour-based incentive 
schemes and the REMCO to manage 
the range of pay outcomes.
Adjustment events exist for the 
purposes of applying malus and 
clawback.
The REMCO retains discretion 
to adjust pay outcomes.
￮ The REMCO retains the discretion to adjust mathematical outcomes of the annual 
bonus scorecard and/or LTIP vesting for any Executive Director if and to the 
extent that it considers this appropriate at their sole discretion.
￮ The REMCO may adjust pay outcomes for the purposes of managing quantum. 
This would be done at the REMCO's discretion after considering single figure 
outcome for the year, taking into account Shell's performance, the operation 
of the remuneration structures and any other relevant considerations.
￮ In exceptional circumstances, the REMCO may determine that the vesting of 
an annual bonus or a share award should be suspended pending the outcome 
of an investigation. The suspension may be for such period as the REMCO 
considers sufficient to permit the investigation to be concluded.
￮ The use of any discretion will be disclosed and explained.
Shareholding requirements
Aligns interests of Executive Directors 
with those of shareholders by 
creating a connection between 
individual wealth and Shell's long-
term performance.
Shareholding (% of base salary):
￮CEO: 700%
￮ CFO: 500%
￮ Executive Directors are expected to build up their shareholding to the required 
level over a period of five years from appointment and, once reached, to 
maintain this level for the full period of their appointment. The intention is for the 
shareholding guideline to be reached through retention of vested shares from 
share plans. The REMCO will monitor progress and retains the ability to adjust 
the guideline in special circumstances on an individual basis.
￮ In the event of an increase to the guideline, this timeframe is increased by one 
year for every additional multiple of salary required, subject to a maximum of 
five years from the date of the change. 
￮ The Executive Director will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement 
(or existing shareholding if lower) for a period of two years from the date they 
cease to be an employee. Post-termination holding is enforced through the 
arrangements put in place with the employee on termination.
￮ In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the REMCO will 
determine their shareholding requirement level, which will not be less than 200% 
of salary, in line with corporate governance best practice.
￮ Vested shares from incentive plans (including bonus and LTIP shares subject to 
holding period) count towards the requirement. The REMCO monitors individual 
progress and retains the ability to adjust the guideline in special circumstances 
on an individual basis.

Notes to the Policy table
Executive Directors outside of the UK
In respect of salary, benefits and pension, in the event that an Executive 
Director is based outside of the UK, the REMCO reserves the right to 
determine the individual's remuneration arrangements in line with their 
base or host country, within the spirit of the Policy.
Payments from previously agreed remuneration arrangements
The REMCO reserves the right to make any remuneration payments 
where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before the Policy
came into effect, or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was
not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the REMCO,
the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming
a Director of the Company. The REMCO also reserves the right to
honour pre-existing contractual obligations in accordance with the 
terms of the service contract and relevant incentive plan. Details
of any such payments will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise.
Selection of performance measures
For the 2023 performance year, the annual bonus scorecard will 
consist of financial delivery (35%), operational excellence (35%), 
progress in the energy transition (15%), and safety (15%). Targets are 
derived from the annual business plan. These measures are designed 
to drive focus on the financial and operational performance critical to 
our success in delivering our strategy. The REMCO believes it is 
important for annual variable pay to remain balanced, with short-term 
operational components complementing the LTIP's focus on longer-term 
financial and strategic outcomes. The same annual bonus scorecard 
applies to the majority of Group employees, supporting consistency of 
remuneration and alignment of objectives across employees and senior 
management.
For 2023 LTIP awards, performance will be assessed based on 75% 
financial metrics (relative CFFO divided by average capital employed, 
relative TSR, absolute OFCF, equally weighted) and 25% on a strategic 
measure focused on Shell's journey in the energy transition. These 
metrics are designed to support our strategic ambition of accelerating 
our transition to be a net-zero emissions business while creating value 
for our shareholders.
For the relative measures, 200% vests for first position, 150% 
for second, 80% for third, and 0% for ranking fourth or fifth. The 
comparator group consists of four of the strongest companies in our 
industry (bp, Chevron, ExxonMobil and TotalEnergies). Outperforming 
Shell's closest competitors on key financial metrics is challenging. 
A vesting outcome of 80% of target (40% of maximum) for median 
performance in a small comparator group is considered appropriate 
by the REMCO. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median 
performance is generally set at a limit of 25% of maximum for other 
UK companies. However, these are typically applied against a larger 
comparator group.
To simplify the plan and align with market practice, the TSR underpin 
has been removed from the plan effective from 2024 awards.
Discretion
There are a number of specific areas in which the REMCO may 
exercise discretion, including: 
￮To review the specific measures, weightings and targets for the 
annual bonus scorecard and LTIP award annually and adjust 
accordingly to evolve with Shell's strategy and circumstances to 
ensure that the targets remain stretching but realistic. If the REMCO 
were to propose any material changes to the LTIP performance 
metrics, it would consult with major shareholders.
￮ To adjust mathematical variable pay outcomes if and to the extent 
that it considers this appropriate. This power to adjust the outcomes 
is broad and includes adjusting the outcomes to zero. For example, 
an adjustment might be made if the REMCO considers:
– the mathematical outcomes do not reflect the wider financial 
or non-financial performance of the Company or the participant 
over the performance period;
– the LTIP vesting percentage is not appropriate in the context of 
circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at award; and 
– there is any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate. 
It is not anticipated that discretion would be used for upwards 
adjustment. If, in exceptional circumstances, it was considered, this 
would be done only after consultation with major shareholders.
Performance outcomes and/or share price movements make it difficult 
to predict the final amounts delivered under the LTIP at the time of 
award. Each year, the REMCO reviews the LTIP vesting values and 
single figure outcomes for the Executive Directors to ensure that they 
are appropriate. The REMCO will review the formulaic single figure 
outcomes relative to the quality of performance outcomes and adjust 
these, taking into account Shell's performance, shareholder experience, 
the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant 
factors to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only 
achieved in years with the highest quality performance. In years where 
the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration inappropriate for 
any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to 
the annual bonus outcome and/or the LTIP vesting outcome for the 
purposes of managing remuneration quantum. In making any 
adjustment to the annual bonus and/or LTIP vesting outcome for this 
purpose, REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the 
Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of 
the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, 
as well as the internal context for other employees. An explanation of 
any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant year's 
Directors' Remuneration Report.
Malus and clawback
Variable pay awards may be made subject to adjustment events. 
At the discretion of the REMCO, such an award may be adjusted 
before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if an 
adjustment event occurs.
Adjustment events will be specified in award documentation and it is 
intended that they will, for example, relate to restatement of financial 
statements due to material non-compliance with a financial reporting 
requirement; misconduct by an Executive Director or misconduct 
through their direction or non-direction; any material breach of health 
and safety or environment regulations; serious reputational damage 
to Shell; material failure of risk management; corporate failure; or other 
exceptional events as determined at the discretion of the REMCO. The 
REMCO retains the right to alter the list of adjustment events in respect 
of future awards.

Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors from that for other employees
The remuneration policies, structure, and approach to setting 
remuneration levels are consistent across organisational levels at Shell, 
with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities. 
A higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for 
Executive Directors and members of Senior Management, to reflect 
these individuals' positions of influence and accountability.
 
Detailed discussion of how executive remuneration aligns with wider Company pay policy 
may be found in the "Workforce engagement on remuneration matters" section of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration on page 204.
Illustration of potential remuneration outcomes 
The charts on this page illustrate the potential future value and 
composition of the Executive Directors' total remuneration opportunities 
under four performance scenarios ("Minimum", "On-target", "Maximum" 
and "Maximum +50% share price appreciation between award and 
vest"). The remuneration opportunities are based on those set out in 
the Policy table, applied to 2023 base salaries. The majority of the 
Executive Directors' remuneration is delivered through variable pay 
elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching 
performance targets.
For simplicity, the charts exclude dividend accrual, and exclude 
the effect of any Company share price movement except in the 
"Maximum +50%" scenario.

Director appointments. These appointments may involve external 
or internal recruitment, or reflect a change in role of a current 
Executive Director.
When determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, 
the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to:
￮attract and motivate candidates of the right quality;
￮ take into account the individual's current remuneration package
and other contractual entitlements;
￮ seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, 
without overpaying;
￮ encourage relocation if required; and
￮ honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal 
candidates before their promotion to the Board, with the exception 
of any previous pension arrangements. 
The REMCO will follow the approach set out below when determining the remuneration package for a new Executive Director.
Ongoing 
remuneration
The salary, benefits, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension benefits will be positioned and 
delivered within the framework of the Policy.
As stated in the Executive Directors' 
Remuneration Policy table, and 
notes to the table.
Compensation for 
the forfeiture of any 
awards under 
variable 
remuneration 
arrangements
To facilitate external recruitment, one-off compensation in consideration for forfeited awards under 
variable remuneration arrangements entered into with a previous employer may be required. The 
REMCO will use its judgement to determine the appropriate level of compensation by matching the 
value of any lost awards under variable remuneration arrangements with the candidate's previous 
employer. This compensation may take the form of a one-off cash payment or an additional award 
under the LTIP. The compensation can alternatively be based on a newly created long-term incentive 
plan arrangement where the only participant is the new Director. The intention is that any such 
compensation would, as far as possible, align to the duration and structure of the award being 
forfeited. Where appropriate, performance conditions, holding periods, and malus and clawback 
provisions will apply.
An amount equal to the value of 
the forfeited variable remuneration 
awards, as assessed by the 
REMCO. Consideration will be 
given to appropriate performance 
conditions, performance periods 
and clawback arrangements.
Component Approach Maximum

Replacement of 
forfeited entitlements 
other than any 
awards under 
variable 
remuneration 
arrangements
There may also be a need to compensate a new Executive Director in respect of forfeited 
entitlements other than any awards under variable remuneration arrangements. This could include, 
for example, contractual entitlements or other benefits. On recruitment, these entitlements may be 
replicated within the Executive Director's remuneration package or valued by the REMCO and 
compensated in cash.
In cases of internal promotion to the Board, any commitments made which cannot be effectively 
replaced within the Executive Director's remuneration package may, at the REMCO's discretion, 
continue to be honoured.
An amount equal to the value of 
the forfeited entitlements, as 
assessed by the REMCO.
Exceptional 
recruitment incentive
Apart from the ongoing annual remuneration package and any compensation in respect of the 
replacement of forfeited entitlements, there may be circumstances in which the REMCO needs 
to offer a one-off recruitment incentive in the form of cash or shares to ensure the right external 
candidate is attracted (e.g. to the industry). The REMCO recognises the importance of internal 
succession planning but it must also have the ability to compete for talent with other global 
companies. The necessity and level of this incentive will depend on the individual's circumstances. 
The intention will be that this is only used in genuinely exceptional circumstances. 
A one-off amount up to the limits 
set out in the Executive Directors' 
Remuneration Policy table, in 
addition to the ongoing package.
Relocation In the event that an internal or external candidate were required to relocate internationally to take 
up the Executive Director position, the REMCO may offer appropriate relocation provisions in 
respect of items including, but not limited to, relocation, assistance with visa/immigration issues, 
housing, and education assistance. If provided, these will be for a specified period of time, expected 
to be no more than two years.
The level of such benefits would be 
set at an appropriate level by the 
REMCO, taking into account the 
circumstances, provisions 
applicable to the wider 
internationally mobile workforce, 
and typical market practice.
Component Approach Maximum
 Executive Directors' service contracts and end of employment arrangements (including change of control provisions)
Service contracts Executive Directors are employed for an indefinite period. Executive Directors based in the UK will be employed on service contracts 
governed by the laws of England and Wales.
Notice period The Executive Director or the Company may terminate employment by giving 12 months' written notice. The Company may require the 
Executive Director to be on garden leave during all or any of the notice period (whether notice is given by the Company or the Executive 
Director).
Payment in lieu of 
notice (PILON)
The Company may terminate an Executive Director's service contract at any time with immediate effect and pay a sum in lieu of the 
unexpired portion of any notice period to the value of no more than 12 months' fixed pay (salary and regular allowances) and other 
benefits (unless statutory requirements to pay additional sums apply). 
The Company has the contractual right to make any PILON in monthly instalments in its discretion. Once the right to make a PILON is 
exercised, its delivery in instalments is mitigated by a contractual obligation on the Executive Director to seek alternative employment. 
Compensation for 
loss of office
Executive Directors will not usually receive additional payments for loss of office, other than, as appropriate, payments in lieu of notice as 
described above or payments in respect of damages if the Company terminates an Executive Director's employment in breach of contract 
(taking into account, as appropriate, the Executive Director's responsibility to mitigate any losses).
The REMCO reserves the right to make payments it considers reasonable in settlement of potential legal claims taking into account 
contractual provisions, applicable law, corporate governance provisions, the applicability of any statutory compensation and the best 
interests of Shell and shareholders as a whole.
Dismissal The Company may terminate employment immediately in particular defined circumstances such as gross misconduct, with no further payment 
or PILON.
Annual bonus 
accrued prior to 
termination
The following provisions will normally apply:
￮In the event of death, disability, injury or ill health, retirement, redundancy, completion of a fixed-term contract, and other circumstances 
at the REMCO's discretion, any annual bonus in the year of departure is pro-rated based on service. Depending on the timing of the 
departure, the REMCO may consider the latest scorecard position or defer payment until the full-year scorecard result is known.
￮ In the event of a change of control, the REMCO will assess the most appropriate treatment for the outstanding bonus period according 
to the circumstances.
￮ Bonuses delivered in shares represent the bonus which a participant has already earned, and carry no further performance conditions. 
Therefore, these shares will normally be unrestricted at the conclusion of the normal holding period otherwise, and no pro-ration will apply.
￮ In other circumstances (including resignation), no award will be made unless statutory requirements apply.
￮ The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of a bonus holding period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).

LTIP awards Share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules. The following provisions will normally apply:
￮ In the event of disability, injury or ill health, retirement, redundancy, completion of a fixed-term contract, and other circumstances at the 
REMCO's discretion: outstanding awards are reduced pro-rata (on a monthly basis) for time elapsed during the performance period. They 
will generally survive the end of employment and remain subject to the same vesting performance conditions, holding period and malus 
and clawback provisions, as if the Executive Director had remained in employment. The extent to which awards vest will be determined 
by the REMCO, taking into account the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied.
￮ In the event of death: the award will vest in full on the date of death or, if there is a target level set out in the performance condition, then 
at that target level, unless the REMCO determines otherwise.
￮ Change of control: awards will be exchanged for equivalent new awards issued by the acquirer, if agreed to by the acquirer and the 
Board. If there is no agreement to exchange awards, awards will (i) vest immediately in full if there is no performance condition, or (ii) vest 
immediately to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied to the date of vesting. Such awards will be reduced pro-rata 
for time elapsed during the performance period unless agreed otherwise.
￮ Other circumstances (including resignation): awards will lapse on cessation of employment unless statutory requirements apply.
￮ The REMCO retains discretion to waive any part of a holding period in exceptional circumstances (primarily death).
Other The provision of end-of-employment benefits such as a contribution to the Executive Director's legal fees for the review of any settlement 
agreement, repatriation costs, and outplacement support may also be included, as deemed reasonable by the REMCO. The Executive 
Director may also remain eligible for other benefits, such as security provision or tax return preparation, in line with policies for the wider 
workforce. The Company may pay the Executive Director's tax on such benefits. 
The REMCO may adjust the range and scope of the benefits offered in the context of developments for other employees in relevant 
countries.
Provision Policy
In the event an Executive Director is based outside of the UK, the REMCO will determine the appropriate service contract and end of 
employment arrangements.
The table below sets out the effective dates of the Executive Directors' service contract.

 Non-executive Directors' Remuneration Policy table
 
Fee structure Approach to setting fees Other remuneration
Non-executive Directors (NEDs) receive a 
fixed annual fee for their Directorship. The 
Chair receives a Chair of the Board fee, and 
other NEDs receive a base fee for membership 
of the Board.
Additional annual fees are payable to any NED 
(other than the Chair of the Board) who serves 
as Senior Independent Director, a Board 
Committee Chair, or a Board committee 
member. Any individual receives either a Chair 
or member fee in respect of each committee they 
sit on. The Chair of a committee does not receive 
both fees.
NEDs receive an additional fee for any Board 
meeting involving intercontinental travel, with 
the exception of one meeting a year held in a 
location other than London.
The Chair of the Board fee is determined by 
the REMCO. The Board determines the fees 
payable to NEDs. The maximum aggregate 
annual fees will be within the limit specified 
by the Articles of Association and in 
accordance with the NEDs' responsibilities 
and time commitments.
The Board reviews NED fees periodically 
to ensure that they are appropriate in the 
context of fee levels at other major listed 
companies.
Business expenses incurred in respect of the performance 
of their duties as a NED will be paid or reimbursed by Shell. 
Such expenses could include transport between home and 
office, and occasional business-required partner travel. NEDs 
may receive a token of recognition on retirement from the 
Board. The maximum value for this is £300. The REMCO has 
the discretion to offer other benefits as appropriate to the 
circumstances. Where business expenses or benefits create 
a personal tax liability to the NED, Shell may cover the 
associated tax. 
The Chair and other NEDs are not eligible to receive awards 
under any incentive or performance-based remuneration plans, 
and personal loans or guarantees are not granted to them.
NEDs do not accrue any retirement benefits as a result of 
their Non-executive Directorships with Shell.
NEDs are encouraged to hold Shell shares with a value 
equivalent to 100% of their annual base fee and maintain 
that holding during their tenure.

Non-executive Director recruitment
The remuneration package for new NEDs is determined within the 
confines of the Policy table for NED fees, and subject to the Articles 
of Association. NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or 
retention awards.
When determining the benefits for a new Chair of the Board, the 
individual circumstances of the future Chair will be taken into account.
Non-executive Director termination of office
No payments for loss of office will be made to NEDs.
Consideration of wider employee views
The REMCO takes account of the pay and employment conditions of 
the broader workforce when setting the Policy for Executive Directors.
While no specific employee groups were consulted as part of the 2023 
Policy review, Shell promotes and maintains good relations with 
employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement 
programme, and operates multiple forums through which employees 
can engage on various business matters, including pay.
When determining Executive Directors' remuneration structure and 
outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant 
reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee 
remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect 
of remuneration, and average salary increases applying in the 
Netherlands, the UK and the USA). During the Policy review, pay and 
employment conditions of the wider Shell employee population were 
taken into account by adhering to the same performance, rewards 
and benefits philosophy for the Executive Directors, as well as overall 
benchmarking principles. Furthermore, any potential differences from 
other employees (see "Differences in Remuneration Policy for Executive 
Directors from that for other employees") were taken into account when 
providing the REMCO with advice in the formation of the Policy.
The REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources 
and Corporate Officer, and the Executive Vice President Performance 
and Reward on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration 
matters extending below the Board and Executive Committee.
 
See "Workforce engagement on remuneration matters" in "Annual Report on Remuneration" 
on page 204 for more information on how Shell considers and engages with the broader 
workforce on remuneration matters.
Consideration of shareholder views
The REMCO engages with major shareholders regularly throughout 
the year. Such engagement allows the REMCO to hear shareholders' 
views on Shell's approach to executive remuneration, and test 
proposals when developing or evolving the Policy. In recent years, the 
REMCO has responded to shareholder views, including the approach 
to energy transition metrics in the LTIP, the quantum of executive pay 
and the broader use of discretion to manage remuneration outcomes. 
In developing the proposed Policy, the REMCO again consulted with 
shareholders and received a diverse range of views that have helped 
to determine which proposals to refine and which to discard. For 
example, as a result of shareholder feedback in the fourth quarter 
of 2022, the REMCO determined not to proceed with seeking support 
for recruitment provision that would permit an extended notice period 
on hiring. Shareholders have been helpful in emphasising the need for 
balanced metrics in the LTIP to help avoid unintended consequences as 
Shell progresses through the energy transition. In 2022, the continued 
interest in the energy transition LTIP measure directly influenced 
increased transparency in Shell's reporting on the progress of its 
energy transition journey.
It was clear to the REMCO that while there were inevitably contrasting 
views around the different aspects of the Policy, shareholders are 
supportive of Shell's overall approach to remuneration and the 
REMCO's careful deliberations in decision-making. The REMCO 
will continue to review the Policy regularly to ensure it continues 
to reinforce Shell's long-term strategy and closely aligns with 
shareholders' interests.
Additional Policy statement
The REMCO reserves the right to make payments outside of the Policy 
in limited, exceptional circumstances, such as for regulatory, tax or 
administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation 
or exchange controls, and only where the REMCO considers such 
payments are necessary to give effect to the intent of the Policy.

Modern Slavery Act Statement
We procure goods and services from local and international suppliers 
who meet the standards we require. The standards include those 
relating to human rights, labour practices and business integrity and 
are governed by the Shell Supplier Principles. Monitoring is undertaken 
centrally in connection with the preparation of the Shell Group's 
Modern Slavery Act (MSA) Statement which is prepared by taking 
proposed inputs from Shell companies in scope of the MSA as to their 
steps taken to ensure modern slavery does not occur in their supply 
chain or organisation. The Shell Group Statement is approved by the 
Board of Shell plc, after approval by the boards of Shell companies 
which are in scope of the MSA.
Disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of 
the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Report 
confirms that, so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company's auditor is unaware. The Director 
has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware 
of that information.
Financial Statements, Dividends and Dividend Policy
 
The "Consolidated Statement of Income" and "Consolidated Balance Sheet" can be 
found on pages 241 and 242 respectively.
Subject to Board approval, Shell aims to grow the dividend per share 
by 4% per annum. As announced as part of Capital Markets Day 
2025, in total, Shell targets the distribution of 40-50% of cash flow 
from operations through the cycle to shareholders. The Board may 
choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of 
dividends and share buybacks.
When setting the level of shareholder distributions, the Board looks at 
a range of factors, including the macro environment, the earnings and 
cash flow of the Group, the balance sheet strength, future investment, 
acquisition and divestment plans, and existing commitments.
The Board currently resolves to pay interim dividends on a quarterly 
basis. Shell does not currently pay a "final" dividend, which would 
need to be voted on by shareholders, requiring the introduction of 
a resolution at the AGM. This would delay the payment of the fourth 
quarter dividend (currently paid in late March) until after the AGM. 
This approach to dividend payments is not uncommon for companies 
distributing returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis.
Shell pays its dividend in USD, EUR or GBP fully electronically either 
in CREST or via interbank transfers.
The Directors have announced a fourth quarter interim dividend 
payable on March 24, 2025, to shareholders on the Register of 
Members at the close of business on February 14, 2025. The closing 
date for dividend currency elections was February 28, 2025 [A] 
and the euro and sterling equivalents announcement date was 
March 10, 2025.
[A] A different dividend currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares 
in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately through Euroclear 
Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either 
directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. 
Such shareholders can contact their broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial 
institution for the election deadline that applies.
2024 Viability Statement and Going Concern Statement
The "Strategic Report" includes information about Shell's strategy, 
financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, as well as the factors, 
including the principal risks, likely to affect Shell's future development. 
It also describes Shell's business model, including competitive 
advantages and key strengths. The Directors assess Shell's prospects 
both at an operating and strategic level, each involving different time 
horizons. To this end, the Directors assess Shell's portfolio and strategy 
against a wide range of outlooks, including assessing the potential 
impacts of various possible energy transition pathways and scenarios 
for changes in societal expectations in relation to climate change. Shell 
recognises in its strategy that the world is transitioning to a low-carbon 
energy system. 
 
See "Our journey to net zero" on pages 76-108.
The "Risk management and risk factors" section (see pages 134-144) 
provides an overview of the principal risks Shell is exposed to in its 
operations. We have assessed which scenarios linked to the principal 
risks could lead to a severe but possible outcome. Consideration was 
given to the climate change and energy transition risk, however the 
associated material impacts are of a longer-term nature, outside the 
three-year viability statement period. Therefore, it was not assessed as 
a stress case scenario for the viability statement. However, it is worth 
noting that key assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, such as future oil and gas prices, 
discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, and 
tax rates, all go well beyond three years and do take climate change 
and energy transition into account.
Viability Statement Process 
[B] Shell's three-year Operating Plan contains assumptions in relation to internal and external 
parameters. Some of the key assumptions include the impact of commodity prices, 
exchange rates, future carbon costs, agreements like LNG contract renewals, production 
levels and product demand and schedules of growth programmes.

Conclusion
Taking account of Shell's position and principal risks at December 31, 
2024, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that Shell will be 
able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over its three-year Operating Plan period.
Going concern
In assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption 
over the period to June 30, 2026 (the "going concern period"), 
management have stress-tested Shell's most recent financial projections 
to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering 
Shell's principal risks, further potential downside pressures on 
commodity prices and cash preservation measures, including 
reduced future capital expenditure and shareholder distributions. 
This assessment confirmed that Shell has sufficient cash, other 
liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet 
its obligations as they fall due in order to continue its operations 
during the going concern period. Therefore, the Directors consider 
it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the audited Consolidated Financial 
Statements. See Note 1 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" on page 245.
Repurchases of shares
As announced as part of Capital Markets Day 2025, Shell targets 
the distribution of 40-50% of our cash flow from operations through 
the cycle to shareholders. The Board may choose to return cash to 
shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. 
For all share buyback programmes mentioned below, Shell entered into 
irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangements with a broker in order to 
reduce the issued share capital of the Company.
On November 2, 2023, under shareholder authorities granted at the 
2023 AGM, Shell announced the commencement of a $3.5 billion 
share buyback programme which was completed on January 26, 
2024. On February 1, 2024, Shell announced the commencement 
of a share buyback programme of a further $3.5 billion which was 
completed on April 26, 2024; and on May 2, 2024, Shell announced 
the commencement of a share buyback programme of a further 
$3.5 billion which was completed on July 26, 2024.
At the May 21, 2024, AGM, shareholders granted the Company 
the authority to repurchase (i) up to 644.2 million ordinary shares "on-
market" (excluding any treasury shares), less any "off-market" purchases 
made under the authority in (ii); and (ii) up to 644.2 million ordinary 
shares off-market (excluding any treasury shares), less any on-market 
purchases made under the authority in (i). The authorities for both on-
market and off-market purchases will expire at the earlier of the close 
of business on August 20, 2025, and the end of the AGM of the 
Company to be held in 2025. On August 1, 2024, Shell announced 
the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback programme which 
was completed on October 25, 2024; on October 31, 2024, Shell 
announced the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback 
programme which was completed on January 24, 2025; and on 
January 30, 2025, Shell announced the commencement of a share 
buyback programme of a further $3.5 billion which is expected to be 
completed by May, 2025. This means that, as at close of March 4, 
2025, approximately 390 million further shares could still be 
repurchased under the current AGM authorities.
More information, including the number and nominal value of the 
shares repurchased in 2024, can be found in Note 27 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements".
The Board continues to regard the ability to repurchase issued shares 
in suitable circumstances as an important part of Shell's financial 
management. New resolutions will be proposed at the 2025 AGM 
to renew the authorities for the Company to purchase its own share 
capital, up to specified limits, for a further year. These proposals 
will be described in more detail in the 2025 Notice of Annual 
General Meeting.
Board of Directors
The names of the Directors who held office during the year can be

reappointment is included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.

Qualifying third-party indemnities
The Company has entered into a Deed of Indemnity (Deed) with 
each Director of the Company who served during the year. The Deeds 
were in force during the 2024 financial year and are currently in force. 
The terms of each of these Deeds are identical and they reflect the 
statutory provisions on indemnities contained in the Companies Act 2006 
(CA 2006). Under the terms of each Deed, the Company has agreed to 
indemnify the Director, to the fullest extent permitted by the CA 2006, 
against any loss, liability or damage, howsoever caused (including in 
respect of a Director's own negligence), suffered or incurred by a Director 
in respect of their acts or omissions while or in the course of acting as a 
Director or employee of the Company, any associated company or 
affiliate (within the meaning of the CA 2006). In addition, the Company 
shall lend funds to Directors as required to meet reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred or to be incurred by them in defending any criminal or 
civil proceedings brought against them in their capacity as a Director or 
employee of the Company, associated company or affiliate, or, in 
connection with certain applications brought under the CA 2006. The 
provisions in the Company's Articles of Association (Articles) relating to 
arbitration and exclusive jurisdiction are incorporated, mutatis mutandis, 
into the Deeds entered into by each Director and the Company.
The Company has provided both indemnities and Directors' and 
Officers' insurance to the Directors in connection with the performance 
of their responsibilities, both of which were in force during the 2024 
financial year and are currently in force. Copies of these indemnities and 
the Directors' and Officers' insurance policies are open to inspection. A 
copy of the form of these indemnities is filed with the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
Related party transactions
Other than disclosures given in Notes 14 and 34 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on pages 280 and 311, there were no 
transactions or proposed transactions that were material to either the 
Company or any related party. Nor were there any transactions with 
any related party that were unusual in their nature or conditions.
Political contributions
No payments were made by Shell companies to political parties, 
organisations or their representatives during the year. Shell USA, 
Inc. administers the non-partisan Shell USA, Inc. Employees' Political 
Awareness Committee (SEPAC), a political action committee registered 
with the US Federal Election Commission. Eligible employees may 
make voluntary personal contributions to the SEPAC. All employees' 
contributions comply with federal and state law and are publicly 
reported in accordance with US election laws. Shell USA, Inc. 
does not exercise control over SEPAC's funding decisions.

An evergreen dividend waiver is in place in respect of 20 unallocated 
shares held in a legacy employee share trust.
Auditor
A resolution relating to the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor

Heathrow Hotel - Terminal 5, London Heathrow Airport, London TW6 
2DG, United Kingdom. The Notice of Annual General Meeting will 
include details of the business to be put to shareholders at the AGM.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with CA 2006 and the Company's Articles, the Board 
may authorise any matter that otherwise may involve any Directors 
breaching their duty to avoid conflicts of interest. The Board has 
adopted a procedure to address these requirements. Detailed conflict 
of interest questionnaires are reviewed by the Board and, if considered 
appropriate, authorised. Conflicts of interest as well as any gifts and 
hospitality received by and provided by Directors are kept under 
review by the Board. Further information relating to conflicts of 
interest can be found in the Articles, available on the Shell website.
Significant commitments of the Chair
The Chair's other significant commitments are given in his biography 
on page 152.
Shell General Business Principles
The Shell General Business Principles define how all employees and 
contractors and those working in joint ventures we operate, 
are expected to conduct their affairs and are underpinned by the 
Shell core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. These 
principles include, among other things, Shell's commitment to support 
fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business 
and to contribute to sustainable development. They are designed to 
mitigate the risk of damage to our business reputation and to prevent 
violations of local and international legislation. They can be found at 
shell.com/sgbp. 
See "Risk management and risk factors" on pages 134-144.
Shell Code of Conduct
Directors, officers, employees and contract staff are required to comply 
with the Shell Code of Conduct, which instructs them on how to behave 
in line with the Shell General Business Principles. This Code clarifies 
the basic rules and standards they are expected to follow and the 
behaviour expected of them. These individuals must also complete 
mandatory Code of Conduct training. Designated individuals are 
required to complete additional mandatory training on antitrust and 
competition laws, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money 
laundering laws, financial crime, data protection laws and trade 
compliance requirements. 
 
See "Risk management and risk factors" on pages 134-144.
 
See shell.com/codeofconduct.
Code of Ethics
Executive Directors and Senior Financial Officers of Shell must also 
comply with the Code of Ethics. In 2024 we updated the conflict of 
interest reporting lines and made other non-substantive revisions to the 
Code of Ethics. This Code is specifically intended to meet the 
requirements of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It can be 
found at shell.com/codeofethics.
Malus and Clawback Policy
In compliance with US SEC rules, the REMCO adopted a Malus and 
clawback policy for Executive Directors and other Executive Committee 
members in 2023. 
Independent professional advice
All Directors may seek independent professional advice in connection 
with their role as a Director. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary. The Company has provided both 
indemnities and Directors' and Officers' insurance to the Directors in 
connection with the performance of their responsibilities. Copies of 
these indemnities and the Directors' and Officers' insurance policies are 
open to inspection. A copy of the form of these indemnities has been 
previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Results presentations and analysts' meetings
The planned dates of the quarterly, half-yearly and annual results 
presentations, as well as all major analysts' meetings, are announced 
in advance on the Shell website and through a regulatory release.
Generally, presentations are broadcast live via webcast. Other 
meetings with analysts or investors are not normally announced in 
advance, nor can they be followed remotely by webcast or any other 
means. Procedures are in place to ensure that discussions in such 
meetings are always limited to non-material information or information 
already in the public domain.
Results and meeting presentations can be found at shell.com/investors. 
This is in line with the requirement to ensure that all shareholders and 
other parties in the financial market have equal and simultaneous 
access to information that may influence the price of the Company's 
securities.
Shell Performance Framework 
The Shell Performance Framework is the overarching framework we use 
to deliver our strategy. It applies to all Shell companies and provides a 
consistent approach for how each company in Shell operates. It seeks 
to empower each company in a way that is fit for purpose, while 
delivering on our overall objectives. It emphasises the value of a holistic 
or "whole systems" approach to business activities along with the 
important role that culture plays in achieving Shell's objectives.

The Shell Performance Framework
The Shell Performance Framework supports the delivery of sustainable business outcomes. In pursuit of this, consideration is given to both 
the context in which Shell operates and key elements of direction-setting, including, for example, Shell's strategy and the Shell General 
Business Principles.
Delivery of the desired outcomes is then pursued by leveraging our Performance Culture, i.e., the shared values, practices and beliefs of our 
employees. This is influenced by decisions on:
￮Structure and Accountability – how we are organised and governed and the associated roles and responsibilities;
￮ People and Skills – our workforce composition, such as its size, diversity and location, and the skills required to deliver Shell's objectives;
￮ Processes and Systems – how we transform inputs into outputs in a controlled manner, leveraging data and systems as appropriate. 
This also includes the standards that further define the boundaries within which Shell operates;
￮ Mindset and Behaviours – this includes the role of leadership and Shell's values, beliefs and behaviours, as set out, for example, in the 
Code of Conduct.
At the heart of the Shell Performance Framework is the Improvement Cycle, which integrates performance management, risk management, 
including controls and assurance, learning and improvement. It follows a "Plan-Do-Check-Adjust" approach and helps to drive a consistent 
way of working and improving.

Risk management and controls
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining procedures 
to manage risk, overseeing the internal control framework, and 
determining the nature and extent of the principal risks that Shell is 
willing to take in order to achieve its long-term strategic objectives.
The Shell Performance Framework sets out the overarching approach 
to how we manage risks in Shell. This approach, together with Shell's 
principal and emerging risks, is described on Page 134.
Board review of principal and emerging risks
The Board confirms it has carried out a robust assessment of Shell's 
principal risks, including a robust process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing these principal risks. The Board also confirms it has carried 
out a robust assessment of Shell's emerging risks. These assessments 
have been in place throughout 2024 and up to the date of this Report, 
are reviewed by the Board and accord with the Financial Reporting 
Council guidance on risk management, internal control and related 
financial and business reporting.
 
See "Risk management and Risk factors" on page 134-144
Review of the effectiveness of the system of risk 
management and internal control
The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) assists the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities in relation to the effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control system, the integrity of financial reporting, and 
consideration of compliance matters. 
 
See "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 176-187.
The ARC receives regular reports from the Chief Internal Auditor 
on notable internal audits and those with a significant impact on the 
effectiveness of controls. The ARC reviews significant incidents involving 
financial, operational and compliance controls and receives regular 
reports on business integrity issues. The ARC also requests updates 
on specific financial, operational and compliance control issues 
throughout the year. It is helped with its monitoring and review 
responsibilities by summaries of the Annual Proved Reserves 
Disclosure as well as the reports of:
￮the Executive Vice President Controller;
￮ the Chief Internal Auditor;
￮ the external auditor;
￮ the Chairs of the Disclosure Committee and the External Reporting 
Control Committee; and
￮ the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. 
The Chair of the ARC provides regular updates to the Board after 
each of its meetings. These updates cover, among other matters, the 
respective aspects of controls that it monitors in accordance with its 
Terms of Reference. During and after such sessions, the Board has the 
opportunity to request further information and ask clarifying questions. 
The Board also receives the approved minutes of the ARC. This 
helps the Board with its ongoing monitoring and annual review 
of material controls.
The Executive Committee and the ARC conduct an annual review of 
the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. 
This is based on their own insights and experience during the year, the 
outcomes of Group-level risk reviews and the Group Assurance Letter 
process. As part of the latter, each Executive Director conducts 
a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal, ethical 
and other requirements of the Shell Performance Framework.
As part of their annual review, the Executive Committee and ARC 
also consider input from the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Ethics 
and Compliance Officer, Executive Vice President Controller and 
the external auditor. The Board reviews and discusses the insights 
and conclusions from this annual assessment. 
The Board confirms that it has conducted its annual review of the 
effectiveness of Shell's system of risk management and internal control 
in respect of 2024, and that this review covered all material controls, 
including financial, operational and compliance controls.
Management's evaluation of disclosure controls and 
procedures of Shell
Shell's management, including the CEO and CFO, has evaluated the 
effectiveness of Shell's disclosure controls and procedures at December 
31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that Shell's 
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
Management's report on internal control over 
financial reporting of Shell
Management, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Shell's 
financial reporting and the preparation of the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements".
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Shell's 
internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements" based on the Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of 
this evaluation, management concluded that, at December 31, 2024, 
the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the 
preparation of the "Consolidated Financial Statements" was effective.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
There has not been any change in the internal control over financial 
reporting of Shell that occurred during the period covered by 
this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to 
materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Shell. 
Material financial information of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access 
Trust is included in the "Consolidated Financial Statements" and is 
therefore subject to the same controls and procedures. 
Articles of Association
The Company's Articles were adopted on May 23, 2023. The Articles 
may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders in a 
general meeting. A full version of the Company's Articles can be found 
at shell.com/investors. 
Management and Directors
The Company has a single-tier Board of Directors headed by a Chair, 
with management led by a CEO. See "The Board of Shell plc" on pages 
152-156 and "Executive Committee" on pages 157-158.
Directors' shareholding qualification
While the Articles do not require Directors to hold shares in the 
Company, the REMCO believes that Executive Directors should 
align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in 
the Company. The CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of 
seven times base salary over five years from appointment and the CFO 
is expected to build up a shareholding of five times base salary over 
the same period. In the event that another Executive Director joins the 
Board, the REMCO will determine their shareholding requirement, 
which will not be less than 200% of their base salary. 
Governance | Other regulatory and statutory information continued
222 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 225 ----
Executive Directors will be required to maintain their requirement 
(or existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for a period of 
two years post employment. Non-executive Directors are encouraged 
to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their base fee
and to maintain that holding during their tenure. 
 
Information on the Directors with shares in the Company can be found in the "Directors' 
Remuneration Report" on pages 188-190.
Appointment and retirement of Directors
The Company's Articles, the Corporate Governance Code and the 
Companies Act 2006 govern the appointment and retirement of 
Directors. Board membership and biographical details of the Directors 
are provided on pages 152-156. However, Directors follow the 
direction laid out in the Corporate Governance Code and stand
for re-election annually. 
Rights attaching to shares
The full rights attaching to shares are set out in the Company's Articles. 
The Company can issue shares with any rights or restrictions attached 
to them as long as this is not restricted by any rights attached to 
existing shares. These rights or restrictions can be decided either by an 
ordinary resolution passed by the shareholders or by the Board as long 
as there is no conflict with any resolution passed by the shareholders.
Voting
Currently, the voting rights of each ordinary share carry one vote 
at a general meeting of the Company.
Change of control
There are no provisions in the Articles that would delay, defer or 
prevent a change of control.
Directors' responsibilities in respect of the preparation 
of the Annual Report and Accounts
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
including the financial statements, in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations. These require the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. As such, the Directors have 
prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent 
Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and with the requirements of the 
UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under 
those standards. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors must not approve 
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of Shell and the Company and of 
the profit or loss of Shell and the Company for that period. In preparing 
these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
￮ adopt the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to do so;
￮ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
￮ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
￮ state whether international accounting standards in conformity 
with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, UK-adopted 
international accounting standards and International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB have been followed.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of Shell and the 
Parent Company and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the 
financial position of Shell and the Parent Company and to enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the UK Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Consolidated Financial Statements are 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. 
The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Shell 
and the Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions can be found 
on page 152-156, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
￮the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 
with international accounting standards in conformity with the 
requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, and therefore in 
accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the 
IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of Shell and the Company; and
￮ the Management Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of Shell, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
Furthermore, so far as each of the Directors is aware, there is no 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware, and each 
of the Directors has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken 
in order to become aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report, including the financial 
statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Shell website (shell.com). Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Shell plc
1. Opinion 
In our opinion, the financial statements of Shell plc (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, Shell or Group):
￮give a true and fair view of the state of Shell's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at December 31, 2024 and of Shell's income and the 
Parent Company's income for the year then ended;
￮ have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and
￮ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of the Parent Company and the Group for the year ended December 31, 2024, which are included 
in the Annual Report and comprise:
 
Group Parent Company
Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024
Consolidated Statement of Income for the year then ended
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended
Related Notes 1 to 36 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including 
material accounting policies, judgements and estimates.
Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024
Statement of Income for the year then ended
Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended
Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended
Related Notes 1 to 17 to the Financial Statements, including material accounting 
policies, judgement and estimates.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting 
standards and International Financial reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
3. Independence
We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.

4. Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation 
of the financial statements is appropriate. The going concern assessment covered the period to June 30, 2026 (the going concern period). 
Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting included:
￮checking the consistency of information used in management's assessment with the operating plan and information obtained through auditing 
other areas of the business such as impairment assessments and deferred tax asset recoverability assessments;
￮ challenging the reasonableness of the estimated financial impact of each of the severe but possible scenarios, and the possible mitigation steps 
and assumptions regarding the availability of future funding options. The scenarios are described by management in the basis of preparation 
statements in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 1 to the Parent Company Financial Statements;
￮ checking that Shell's operating plan reflects the actions that management intend to take in order to achieve their stated Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions reductions, as stated in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including confirming that the operating and capital 
expenditure estimates to deliver the reductions are included in the operating plan. This included evaluating Shell's carbon pricing assumptions; 
￮ conducting severe but plausible independent stress testing to a significantly lower price environment than current prices throughout the going 
concern period and a reverse stress test to determine the conditions under which Shell could potentially experience a liquidity shortfall; and
￮ assessing that Shell's going concern disclosures were appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or 
collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern until June 30, 2026. 
In relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company 
Financial Statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant section of this report. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's or Parent Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
5. Overview of our audit approach 
 
 Key audit matters (Section 6)
The key audit matters that we identified in the 2024 audit were:
￮ impact of climate change and the energy transition on the Consolidated Financial Statements;
￮ estimation of oil and gas reserves;
￮ impairment assessment of property plant and equipment (PP&E) and joint ventures and associates (JVAs); and
￮ accounting for complex transactions within Shell's Gas & Power trading and supply function and the valuation of 
physical and financial derivatives.
Assessing materiality
(Section 7)
We based materiality on three-year normalised Adjusted Earnings on a pre-tax basis. This approach removes both the 
effects of changes in oil price on inventory carrying amounts and non-recurring gains and charges disclosed as identified 
items, which can significantly distort Shell's results in any one particular year. By applying a normalised Adjusted Earnings 
approach, we concluded that it was appropriate to set planning materiality at $2.0 billion. We adopted the following 
materiality measures in our 2024 audit:

Statements (Section 8)
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components and audit procedures on specific 
balances for a further 80 components and central procedures on climate change and energy transition on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, estimation of oil and gas reserves, impairment assessment of property, plant and 
equipment (PP&E) and joint ventures and associates and accounting for complex transactions within Shell's Gas & Power 
trading and supply function and the valuation of physical and financial derivatives. 
Our scope was tailored to the circumstances of our audit of Shell and is influenced by our determination of materiality and 
our assessed risks of material misstatement. Similar to the prior year, during the course of the 2024 audit, we did not make 
any substantial changes to our assessment of the components where we performed full or specific scope audit procedures; 
however, what did change was the nature and emphasis of our testing in response to our significant audit risks and areas 
of audit focus. By following this approach, our audit effort focused on higher risk areas, such as management judgements.

6. Our assessment of key audit matters
Key audit matters (KAMs) are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on; the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts 
of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of Shell's Consolidated and Parent Company Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the Consolidated Financial Statements
Description of the key audit matter
The financial statement and audit risks related to climate change and the energy transition remain an area of audit focus given 
the continuing uncertainty surrounding the impact of climate change and the pervasive impact it has on many areas of accounting 
judgement and estimation and, therefore, our audit. 
The processes by which management is informed about climate-related issues is set out in Our journey to net zero, within the Strategic report, and Sustainability 
Statements which forms part of the "other information", rather than the audited financial statements. Within these sections, Shell have described climate-related risks 
and opportunities over the short, medium and long term. They also describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on Shell's business, strategy and 
financial planning and Shell's process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and the process for managing these risks. 
In Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Shell describe how they consider climate-related impacts in key areas of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and how this translates into the valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities.
In carrying out our audit, we have focused on the alignment of assumptions adopted by Shell in the preparation of their financial statements with commentary on 
climate change within their Strategic Report and Sustainability Statements. We have also considered the information and data on material impacts, risks and 
opportunities based on the outcome of the double materiality assessment included in the Sustainability Statements. We also focused on how Shell had reflected 
material climate change risks in their financial statements, including the impact of climate-related targets and ambitions on accounting estimates and judgements. 
In focusing on how Shell has reflected material climate change risks in Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements, we have considered:
1) how Shell's assumed future commodity price assumptions compare to energy transition scenarios; 
2) the reasonableness of Shell's forecast future carbon costs; 
3a) the carbon intensity of Shell's Chemicals and Products, Upstream and Integrated Gas assets and associated products;
3b) the material financial statements risk associated with delivery of decarbonisation projects of Shell's assets to meet their climate-related targets and ambitions; 
4) the useful economic lives of assets beyond 2050 and the risk of material stranded assets; and
5) how physical risk considerations have been incorporated into Shell's asset plans.
The critical accounting judgements and estimates that are impacted by climate change and the energy transition are disclosed within Note 4 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. 
Our response to the risk
Overall response
To respond to the impact of climate change and the energy transition on our audit, we ensured that we had the appropriate skills and experience within the audit 
team. Our group engagement team included professionals with significant experience in climate change and energy transition. The audit procedures were performed 
by the group engagement team and component teams. 
In our 2024 audit, as part of our risk assessment, we considered financial and non-financial data to assess five climate risks at a granular level. This covered Shell's 
higher risk assets, with a net book value of around $35 billion. We considered the carbon intensity of the assets and products sold and where there could be a higher 
degree of management judgement and bias. This included considering the material financial statement impact of delivery risks of certain decarbonisation projects. 
For the assets that we assessed as most susceptible to climate change and energy transition risks, we performed sensitivity analysis and read management's climate 
scenario analysis to assess whether there were indicators of impairment.
Further procedures performed to address the climate risks included:
Alignment of statements made in Strategic Report and Sustainability Statements with the financial statements
￮ in connection with our audit of the financial statements, we read the other information in the Annual Report and Accounts (as defined in section 9 below) and, in 
doing so, considered whether the other information, which includes Shell's climate targets, are materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit;
￮ evaluated whether the effects of material climate risks, as disclosed within Our journey to net zero, within the Strategic report, had been appropriately reflected in 
asset values and associated financial statement disclosures, and the timing, nature and measurement of liabilities recognised are in accordance with IFRS, which is 
discussed further below;
￮ read and challenged the completeness of management's disclosures in Note 4. We audited the sensitivity disclosures in Note 4 of the carrying value of Shell's 
Upstream and Integrated Gas PP&E assets to a range of future oil and gas price assumptions, reflecting reduced demand scenarios due to climate change and the 
energy transition, including the IEA Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 scenario and Announced Pledges Scenarios (APS). This included considering whether the 
downside sensitivities could have reduced the level of Shell's distributable profits such that their 2024 shareholder distributions would not have been in compliance 
with the Companies Act 2006. For Upstream, Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products assets, we also considered the carrying amounts and their sensitivity to 
IEA NZE 2050 carbon price scenario and the discount rate sensitivity considering Upstream, Integrated Gas, Marketing, Chemicals and Products and Renewables 
and Energy Solutions carrying amounts; and 
￮ assessed whether the climate change litigation described in Note 32 was complete and whether it represented obligations where the likelihood of a cash outflow 
was probable and therefore requiring provision. Also, we considered the appropriateness of the climate change litigation disclosures within Note 32, Legal 
proceedings and other contingencies, by comparing the disclosures to our understanding of the claims and allegations and to the most recent disclosures 
provided by other oil and gas companies.

The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Our response to the risk continued
The reflection of material climate change risks and the impact of Shell's climate-related targets and ambitions in the material 
judgements and estimates
￮tested management's internal controls over the identification and estimation of costs of the potential impacts associated with energy transition and climate change, 
and related financial statement disclosures in Note 4; and
￮ held discussions with Group Planning, Group Reporting, Shell's Carbon Strategy group, Safety, Environment, Asset Management Group and, where necessary, 
individual asset managers to understand and challenge management on how the following four transition and one physical risks of climate change were being 
factored into Shell's financial statements:
1) The comparison of Shell's assumed future commodity price assumptions to energy transition scenarios
￮we engaged oil and gas valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of Shell's short and long-term pricing assumptions. This included benchmarking Shell's 
assumptions against a range of third party forecasts (including other oil and gas companies, consultants, banks, brokers and other external outlooks such as 
International Energy Agency ('IEA'));
￮ considered specifically the extent to which management's forecast price assumptions incorporated the potential impact of climate change and the energy 
transition. This included consideration of assumed hydrocarbon and renewables demand and the impacts of such demand movements and supply constraints 
on future prices; and
￮ evaluated the reasonableness of Shell's refining and petrochemical margin assumptions, by comparing Shell's assumptions to external benchmarks. We also 
considered the expected impact on demand for oil products and chemicals in a transition to a net zero economy. Refining margin and petrochemical assumptions 
underpin the recoverable amount of refineries and petrochemical plants respectively.
2) The reasonableness of Shell's forecast future carbon costs
￮we engaged our climate change specialists to assist in evaluating Shell's carbon price methodology, including how price and free allowance assumptions are 
applied in different jurisdictions. At a country level, we compared Shell's forecast carbon prices to those presented under the IEA NZE scenario. Our procedures 
were focused on assets with high Scope 1 and 2 emissions and which are geographically located in high carbon price jurisdictions; and
￮ we independently calculated Shell's forecast carbon cost included in their operating plan, based on carbon price, free allowance and emission assumptions. 
We performed sensitivity analysis on the mid-point carbon price and free allowance assumptions in the operating plan to the independently determined outlooks 
identified by our climate change and energy transition specialists to determine whether deviations are material to Shell's operating plan and respective assets.
3a) The carbon intensity of Shell's Chemicals and Products, Upstream and Integrated Gas assets and associated products; and
3b) The material financial statements risk associated with the delivery of decarbonisation projects of Shell's assets to meet their 
climate-related targets and ambitions
￮we considered the Scope 1 and 2 and lifecycle emissions of the products sold by Shell's assets (net carbon intensity), to identify potential impairment triggers. For 
Shell's high carbon intensive assets, we considered the decarbonisation plans included in their operating plan. We obtained an understanding of the planned 
strategies and the basis for associated costs with projects related to carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency and renewables growth. We considered 
decarbonisation strategies and challenged the associated opex and capex included in the operating plan. 
￮ we confirmed that Shell's operating plan, included costs associated with Shell's plans to achieve their Scope 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 category 11 emission 
relating to oil products and their net carbon intensity ('NCI') targets and ambitions. We challenged management's ability to accurately forecast their scope 1 and 2 
emissions assumptions included in the operating plan to meet their 2030 absolute emissions targets through the performance of look-back analysis; and
￮ we also performed sensitivity analysis by removing all in-plan decarbonisation projects at high carbon intensive assets to determine whether the incremental carbon 
cost that would need to be incurred on emissions would trigger an impairment. We also performed a sensitivity analysis on major decarbonisation projects relating 
to assets with higher risk of impact from climate change. We used this to determine whether there would be a material impairment risk should these projects extend 
past their planned operation date. We also considered additional decarbonisation levers outside of the operating plan, which Shell has optionality to execute in 
order to meet their climate targets. We confirmed whether the carbon credits and associated costs were included in the operating plan to meet Shell's 2030 
ambitions.
4) The useful economic lives of assets beyond 2050 and the risk of material stranded assets
￮considering Shell's long-term target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we have assessed Upstream and Integrated Gas assets which are expected to be 
producing beyond 2050. We also verified that the oil, gas and carbon price sensitivity disclosures in Note 4 incorporated life of field assumptions.
5) Whether physical risk considerations have been incorporated into the asset plans
￮evaluated management's disclosures around physical risk in the Our journey to net zero section of the Annual Report to ensure compliance with the Task Force 
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures;
￮ using our data analytics and climate change specialists, we performed a physical risk assessment that considered Shell's asset-level mitigation and adaptation 
measures for the assets that we viewed as being exposed to the highest physical risks, such as hurricanes, flooding, rising temperatures, drought and water 
dredging. For assets assessed to be high risk, we evaluated the mitigation and adaption measures, and ensured that where relevant, the costs have been 
appropriately reflected in the operating plan; and
￮ assessed whether the risk exposure represents an impairment trigger for the associated asset through consideration of the severity of the physical risk, likely time 
horizon, historical ability to manage physical risk and headroom of the asset.
Our procedures were led by the group engagement team, with input from our teams in Australia and Brazil.
Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit and Risk Committee 
We reported to the Audit and Risk Committee the key procedures that we had performed and the results of those procedures, which are set out below: 
Alignment of statements made in Strategic Report and Sustainability Statements with the financial statements
￮ we reported that we had not identified any material inconsistencies between Shell's disclosures in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which covers 
the material impacts of climate-related matters, and the disclosures included within the other information; and 
￮ we reported that the various climate change litigation as detailed in Note 32 were appropriately disclosed and represented possible obligations.

The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
 
Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit and Risk Committee continued
The reflection of material climate change risks and the impact of Shell's climate-related targets and ambitions in the critical accounting 
estimates and judgments
1) the comparison of Shell's assumed future commodity price assumptions to energy transition scenarios
￮ we reported that Shell's price assumptions were within the acceptable range when compared against third party forecasts, peer benchmarks and our 
independently determined ranges;  
￮ IEA's Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) price assumptions, which assumes that all climate commitments made by governments around the world to date, are 
aligned with Shell's oil price assumptions. Shell's Henry Hub gas price assumption are higher than the APS scenario; however, Henry Hub is not a significant input 
to the recoverable amount of the of the assets that are expected to be producing beyond 2030 and 2050; 
￮ IEA's NZE price scenarios are lower than Shell's Brent and Henry Hub price assumptions and represent an aspirational target reflecting governmental, societal and 
regulatory responses to climate change risks that are still developing; however, as IFRS requires preparers to base the financial statements on current best estimates 
of future oil and gas prices, we concluded that Shell's assumptions were within a range of benchmarks that reflect the current best estimates of future oil and gas 
prices; and 
￮ we reported that Shell's refining and chemical margin assumptions were in line with our internally developed range. 
2) the reasonableness of Shell's forecast future carbon costs
￮we concluded that Shell's carbon pricing methodology was appropriate. Also, we reported that, based on our benchmarking, Shell's forecasted carbon prices were 
materially in line with our independently determined ranges. For certain years where Shell's country specific carbon prices were outside of our independently 
determine range, we reported that applying our range would not result in an impairment trigger at the impacted assets. 
￮ we reported that the increase in carbon costs included in the operating plan was primarily driven by a decrease in free allowances permitted by regulators in high 
carbon price jurisdictions. 
￮ we reported the result of our sensitivity assessment to remove all in-plan decarbonisation projects for highly carbon intensive assets. The incremental carbon costs 
incurred by removing these projects would be materially offset by the project CAPEX and OPEX saved in the operating plan. 
3a) the carbon intensity of Shell's Chemicals and Products, Upstream and Integrated Gas assets and associated products; and
3b) the material financial statements risk associated with the delivery of decarbonisation projects of Shell's assets to meet their 
climate-related targets and ambitions 
￮for the assets that we assessed as highly carbon intensive, with decarbonisation projects we considered to be exposed to higher delivery risk, we reported that 
the headroom at each asset has would withstand the incremental carbon costs that would be incurred if these decarbonisation projects were to be removed from 
Shell's operating plan. We also reported that the assumptions relating to these projects were appropriately reflected in the operating plan;
￮ we reported that the impact of climate change and energy transition has been appropriately considered in Shell's financial statements and disclosures and that 
we did not identify any material inconsistencies between Shell's climate-related targets and ambitions and Shell's material financial statement judgement and 
estimates. This includes the expected financial impact of management's current planned actions to address the identified climate change risks. Where impairment 
assessments were performed, climate change factors had been reflected in these assessments throughout the field life of the asset.
4) the useful economic lives of assets beyond 2050 and the risk of material stranded assets
￮we reported that, given Shell's climate-related targets and ambitions, there may be a higher risk of reserves not ultimately being produced where assets are carbon 
intensive or where assets are forecast to be producing beyond 2030. We analysed Shell's integrated Gas and Upstream assets and the Canadian mines to identify 
such assets. We then considered if there was evidence to indicate that net book value of these assets were overstated and would be regarded as "stranded assets". 
Of the SEC proved reserves currently recognised at the end of 2024, 52% are expected to be produced by 2030 and only an insignificant amount, 3% (<1% 
excluding oil sands that are held for sale) would be produced beyond 2050. As the impacted assets are mainly depreciated over SEC proved reserves, the current 
carrying amount of these assets will be substantially depreciated by 2050, with only around $1.8 billion ($1.2 billion excluding oil sands that are held for sale) will 
not have been depreciated;
￮ we reported that, based on the depreciation profile of Shells' refineries, that there was a low risk of stranded assets. Also, we concluded there was a low risk of 
Shell's chemicals manufacturing plants being stranded as chemical demand is expected to be resilient to energy transition, as highlighted by the IEA and other 
market commentators; and
￮ we reported that the recognition of reserves and resources beyond 2050 is not inconsistent Shell's NZE ambitions and that at the balance sheet date there was 
no indicator that these reserves should be derecognised and that the estimated carrying value of these assets in 2050 is not material. 
5) whether physical risk considerations have been incorporated into the asset plans
￮for the assets that we assessed as susceptible to higher physical risk, we reported that mitigation and adaptation plans and associated costs were reflected in the 
operating plan, other than where it had been demonstrated that assets were expected to withstand the physical events, for example severe weather events, or 
where insurance was in place. Also, we reported that, with the assistance of our climate change specialists, we had re-performed a physical risk assessment over 
Shell's assets and had not identified any new physical risks that had not been considered by Shell. The risks included extreme weather, flooding, higher 
temperatures, drought and water dredging.
Other observations
￮with regards to the sensitivity analyses provided by Shell in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including commodity prices, carbon prices, refining 
and chemical margins and the discount rate, we were satisfied that the descriptions of the sensitivities reflected the sensitivities performed. Also, the prices and 
assumptions applied by Shell in their calculations were agreed to the scenarios as described. We reperformed the sensitivities and did not identify a material 
difference to the ranges disclosed by Shell in Note 4, including the illustrative disclosures on the impact of commodity prices averaged from three 1.5-2°C external 
climate change scenarios and from the IEA NZE50 scenario; and
￮ we reported that we had considered Shell's dividend resilience statement in Note 4. Had Shell applied the IEA NZE50 scenario, and had this impairment of 
$26-$34 billion directly reduced the carrying value of investments within the Parent Company, Shell plc, this would not have impacted the distributable reserves 
available to Shell from which to pay dividends and buyback shares in 2024. This is on the basis that Shell plc had a merger reserve of $234 billion and under 
Companies Act 2006, the adverse impact from an impairment would be on the merger reserve as opposed to distributable reserves.
See the "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 176-187 for details on how the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed climate change and energy transition. See " Our strategy" on pages 10-13 
and "Energy transition strategy" on pages 77-92 for more details. Also, see Notes 2, 4, 12, 13, and 32 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".

6. Our assessment of key audit matters continued
Estimation of oil and gas reserves
 
Description of the key audit matter
This is a forecast-based estimate. Oil and gas reserves estimates are used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and 
amortisation (DD&A) and impairment testing. The risk is the inappropriate recognition of proved reserves that impacts these 
accounting estimates. Given the current environment, there may be a heightened risk of proved reserves with a high carbon 
intensity not ultimately being produced (also see climate change and energy transition key audit matter). 
As described in Notes 12 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2024, production assets amounted to $102.2 billion and had an 
associated DD&A charge of $15 billion. Joint ventures and associates (JVAs) amounted to $23.4 billion. As further described in Note 13, exploration and production 
impairment losses of $0.8 billion and exploration and production impairment reversals of $74 million were recorded during the year.
The estimation of proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geopolitical, technical, contractual, and 
economic information. Estimates can change over time because of new information from production or drilling activities, changes in economic factors, such as oil and 
gas prices, alternations in the regulatory policies of host governments, or other events. Downward adjustments could indicate lower future production volumes and 
could also lead to revised DD&A rates and to impairment of assets. 
The estimation of oil and gas reserves and resources is a higher risk estimate given the significant judgement by management, including the use of management's 
specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves volumes, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor 
judgement, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumption used by 
management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves volumes. 
The estimates are based on the Company's central group of experts' assessments of petroleum initially in place, production curves and certain other inputs, including 
prices, license expiration date, capex and opex. Estimation uncertainty is further elevated given the transition to a low-carbon economy, which increases the risk of 
under-utilised or stranded oil and gas assets.
Our response to the risk
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's oil and gas reserves estimation process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their 
operating effectiveness. For example, we tested management's review controls over changes to year-on-year estimated oil and gas reserves volumes.
We involved professionals with oil and gas reserves audit experience in evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies applied by management.
Our procedures included, amongst others: 
￮ attended all of Shell's Upstream Reserves Committee meetings to observe the internal review and endorsement process. These meeting are part of Shell's proved 
reserves assurance process, which is described in Supplementary Information – Oil and gas section;
￮ evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of management's internal reservoir engineers who performed the detailed preparation of the reserve 
estimates and those who are primarily responsible for providing independent review and challenge, and ultimately endorsement of, the reserve estimates. This 
covered around 26 individuals involved in the process; 
￮ evaluated management's estimation of the point at which the operating cash flow from a project becomes negative (the economic limit), as this impacts DD&A and 
impairment. Where relevant, we assessed whether the economic limit test incorporated Shell's estimate of future carbon costs to reflect the potential impact of 
climate change and the energy transition; 
￮ assessed the completeness and accuracy of the inputs used by management in estimating the oil and gas reserves by agreeing the inputs to source documentation. 
This included obtaining an understanding of the non-financial information used by the specialists when estimating the reserves. We also performed procedures 
around the completeness and accuracy of this information; 
￮ performed back-testing of historical data to identify indications of optimism bias over time;
￮ performed sensitivity analysis on the impact of changes in oil and gas reserves;
￮ verified significant additions to, or reductions in, proved reserves and that they have been recorded in the appropriate period, and that they are in compliance with 
Shell's reserves and resources guidance and SEC regulations. Our most experienced oil and gas team members, which included a reservoir engineer, reviewed the 
documentation and approvals of all changes greater than 30 mmboe (eight fields); 
￮ we focused our audit procedures on those assets that are currently forecast to be producing beyond 2050 and the carbon intensity of the post 2050 production 
from those fields to identify assets that are carbon intensive, where there may be a higher risk of the reserves not ultimately being produced. The purpose of 
performing such analysis was to identify assets that were at higher risk of the current net book value being overstated; and
￮ we also included unpredictability in our testing by selecting a field that did not meet our selection criteria.
Our procedures were led by the group engagement team, with input from our teams in Australia, Brazil, Nigeria, Poland, Qatar, UK and the USA.
Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit and Risk Committee
We reported to the Audit and Risk Committee in January 2025 that, there are no indications that the recognition of the reserve volumes beyond 2030 and 2050 
results in any impairment triggers. 
We reported to the Committee that the sensitivity analysis that we performed indicated that, at portfolio level with all other assumptions remaining unchanged, 
reserves would have to be misstated by 18% for DD&A to be misstated by a material amount ($2 billion).
The inputs and assumptions used to estimate proved reserves and resources are consistent with Shell's policies and principles. We reported that the recognition of 
reserves and resources beyond 2050 is not inconsistent with Shell's NZE ambitions and that it remains appropriate to recognise these reserves. After the oil sands 
divestment, less than 1% of proved reserves are expected to be produced beyond 2050.
Please see key audit matter on the impact of climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements for details of our considerations on the carbon 
intensity associated with reserves expected to be produced beyond 2050.
See the "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 176-187 for details on how the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed assurances for oil and gas reserves. Also, see Notes 2, 4 and 12 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements" and "Supplementary information – oil and gas (unaudited").

Impairment assessment of Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and Joint ventures and associates (JVA)
Description of the key audit matter
This is a forecast-based estimate. The risk is that potential impairments are not identified on a timely basis, including whether the 
impacts of climate change and the energy transition have been considered in Shell's impairment trigger assessments (also see climate 
change and energy transition key audit matter). 
As described in Notes 12, and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2024 Shell recognised $102.2 billion of production assets, $50.8 billion 
of manufacturing, supply and distribution assets (primarily refineries and petrochemical plants) and $23.4 billion of joint ventures and associates (JVAs). As disclosed 
in Note 13 and 14, in 2024, Shell recognised $1.3 billion and $0.9 billion of impairment losses relating to manufacturing, supply and distribution assets and JVA's 
respectively.
The recoverable amount of PP&E and JVAs can be sensitive to small changes in key assumptions, which increases the risk of indicators of impairment or impairment 
reversal not being identified. Our audit effort has focused on the completeness and timely identification of indicators of impairment charges or impairment reversals. 
Assumptions underpinning the impairment assessments include:
￮ changes in future oil and gas prices, in particular over the mid-to-long term, which are more uncertain than short term forecasts;
￮ changes in refining margin assumptions;
￮ expected production volumes;
￮ the assumed weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and asset-specific risks; and
￮ individual asset impairment assessments.
As described in Note 2, the most complex of these judgements relate to management's view on the long-term oil and gas price outlook. Forecasting future prices is 
inherently difficult, as it requires forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, policy measures and, on the 
supply side, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply and behaviour of major resource holders. These judgements are 
particularly difficult because of increased demand uncertainty and pace of decarbonisation due to climate change and the energy transition. 
Our response to the risk
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's asset impairment process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating 
effectiveness. For example, we tested the controls over management's identification of indicators of impairment and reversals of impairment and the approval of oil 
and gas prices and petrochemical and refining margins.
Our procedures included, amongst others:
Commodity price assumptions
￮ we have included observations on oil and gas prices in our key audit matter above on climate (The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).
￮ we involved our valuations specialists to assess the reasonableness of Shell's margin estimation methodologies and assumptions; and
￮ evaluated the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin assumptions by comparing these to independent market, consultant forecasts and independently 
determined ranges.
Oil and gas reserves
￮ we have included observations in our key audit matter above on oil and gas reserves (Estimation of oil and gas reserves).
Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
￮we involved our valuations specialists who reviewed Shell's WACC methodology and calculation. We independently assessed a range of reasonable input 
assumptions for calculating Shell's WACC; and
￮ assessed whether Shell's risking in their impairment assessments, through both a discount rate and individual asset cash flows, adequately reflects the appropriate 
level of risking for the asset.

Impairment assessment of Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and Joint ventures and associates (JVA) continued
Our response to the risk continued
Individual asset assessments
￮ evaluated Shell's assessment of impairment losses and impairment reversal triggers, including changes in the forecast commodity price assumptions, movements 
in oil and gas reserves, changes in asset performance, changes in Shell's operating plan assumptions, including those relating to Shell's climate-related targets and 
ambitions, and whether these are indicators of impairment or impairment reversal. We also considered whether potential disposals meet the held for sale criteria; 
￮ separately from management, for material assets, we also assessed independently whether or not indicators of impairment or reversal triggers exist; 
￮ where triggers were identified, we assessed the inputs to the impairment assessment by comparing forecasts to the operating plan and life of field plans, historical 
actuals and other independent expectations. We also performed a consistency check on the assumptions to other assumptions applied by the group such as 
commodity prices and WACC; 
￮ tested the model integrity of material impairment assessments; 
￮ evaluated the assumptions used in the preparation of the operating plan at a group, segment and asset level and compared the actual performance of assets 
to the forecasts made in the prior year; 
￮ considered the existence of other contradictory evidence, such as the results of any comparable market transactions that could indicate a material increase or 
decrease in the recoverable amount of any of the assets, public comments or commitments made by Shell and whether these could impact the future potential 
value of any assets; and
￮ assessed potential operational changes that have or are expected to have a significant adverse effect on an asset, such unplanned shutdowns, and whether they 
should be considered as impairment triggers.
The audit procedures were performed primarily by our group engagement team as well as our local audit teams in Australia, Canada, Nigeria, Poland, UK and USA.

￮Shell applied a post-tax WACC of 7.5% (2023: 7.5%) in all impairment assessments performed during the year, other than for the Power business, where a post-
tax WACC of 6% (2023: 6%) has been used. Shell's methodology used in estimating the Group-wide WACC was consistent with the requirements set out in IAS 
36. We also reported that while Shell's rate was marginally below our estimated range we were satisfied the difference was immaterial. Shell's commodity prices 
are at the conservative end of reasonable ranges, therefore we would expect the WACC assumption to also be at the bottom end of reasonable ranges. Shell's 
WACC was within the range with those adopted by peers.
￮ In addition to applying a discount rate to risk cash flows, Shell also applied asset-specific risks directly in their cash flows. We reported that our valuation specialists 
estimated an asset-specific discount rate (the WACC and additional cash flow risking) for the most significant impairment assessments performed and that the 
implicit discount rates were within our ranges.
Individual asset assessments
￮We reported to the Committee that the outcomes of the individual impairment assessments were reasonable, including the timing of the assessments. We provided 
the Committee with our observations on asset impairment trigger assessments where we spent the most audit effort, which included assessments where no 
charge was deemed necessary. Our observations included areas such as held for sale classification, cash flow phasing, cash flow risking and alignment with 
the operating plan.
￮ We reported that there was adequate headroom supporting the goodwill within Upstream, Integrated Gas and Marketing and that there are no material goodwill 
impairment judgements relating to RE&S.
See the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 176 for details on how the Audit and Risk Committee considered impairments. Also, see Notes 2, 4, 12, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

6. Our assessment of key audit matters continued
Accounting for complex transactions within Shell's Gas & Power Trading and Supply (T&S) function and the valuation 
of physical and financial derivatives
Description of the key audit matter
The recognition of complex deals requires accounting and valuation judgement. There is a risk that an incorrect accounting judgement 
may be applied to complex contracts executed by Shell's Gas & Power T&S function (fair value or accrual accounting) and that for 
those contracts being fair valued, the valuation may not be in accordance with IFRS. Additionally, there is a higher inherent risk of 
rogue trading associated to Shell's wider portfolio of over-the-counter traded position.
As described in Note 26, Shell recognised derivative financial instrument assets of $10 billion and derivative financial instrument liabilities of $9.6 billion. As described 
in Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2024 Shell recognised $284 billion of revenue. A subset of the consolidated revenue relates to 
T&S transactions, where there is a risk of unrealised revenues being inappropriately recorded. Shell has identified trading in the risk factors section of the Strategic 
Report, which form part of the other information, rather than the audited financial statements. 
Shell's trading and supply function is integrated within the Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions 
segments. The function executes and settles both standard and non-standard complex trades. The IT environment supporting the function is complex and involves 
a large number of systems, resulting in a high degree of manual intervention being required.
Auditing complex trades is challenging due to the significant judgement needed to determine the appropriate accounting treatment and the key assumptions used 
in valuing the trades. Furthermore, trading often does not take place in active markets where prices are readily available, especially for longer-dated contracts. This 
increases the subjectivity in determining the pricing curve and volatility assumptions, which are essential inputs for valuing the trades and assessing unrealized gains 
and losses. 
Rogue trading activity may occur on Shell's portfolio of over-the-counter positions because of trader incentives and the high volume of transactions that Shell executes.
Our response to the risk
We obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the recognition of revenue relating to unrealised trading gains and losses, including controls 
over management's complex deal accounting and valuations. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. 
We involved audit professionals with experience auditing large commodity trading organisations. Our audit procedures focus on the appropriateness of the 
accounting treatment and the valuation of complex contracts. 
To respond to the risk of inappropriate accounting for complex deals we:
￮ assessed the completeness of the list of complex deals;
￮ directly confirmed with the counterparty a sample of new or amended complex deals;
￮ obtained an understanding of the commercial rationale of complex deals by analysing transaction documents and agreements and through discussions with 
management. 
￮ we performed an independent assessment of the accounting treatment of a sample of the complex deals, challenging management on contractual terms and 
previous accounting judgement;
￮ assessed the reasonableness of Shell's derivative valuation methodology by comparing it to market practice, analysing whether a consistent framework was applied 
and confirmed the consistency of inputs used in deal valuations and other assumptions;
￮ involved valuation specialists to assist us in performing independent testing of complex deals, checking that the appropriate valuation model has been applied. 
Our valuations were established using independent externally sourced inputs, where available;
￮ tested the forward pricing curve and volatility assumptions in management's valuation models, including comparing to external broker quotes, market consensus 
providers, and our independent assessments;
￮ recalculated the mark to market valuation including reserves if any, against validated forward pricing curves to ensure it is consistent with Shell's mark to market 
valuation;
￮ we specifically challenged management's accounting consideration of whether forward physical contracts to buy and sell LNG are in the scope of IFRS 9 and 
should be fair valued. 
To respond to the risk of rogue trading activity, we:
￮performed external confirmation procedures for the existence and completeness of recorded forward positions. Our tests included, among other procedures, 
requesting Shell's counterparties to confirm their entire position with Shell and asking counterparties to provide details of individual trades;
￮ performed additional procedures over the post year-end tradebook to identify material additions, deletions or amendments from the balance sheet date procedures 
and validating the impact on the balance sheet date;
￮ analysed material post-balance sheet date deal entries and cash receipts/disbursements to assess the completeness of the associated derivative recorded as of the 
balance sheet date; and
￮ performed testing of deals that were unconfirmed or excluded from the management's confirmation process at the balance sheet date. We obtained evidence of the 
trade's existence at the year-end and validating their exclusion respectively, for a sample of deals; and
The audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team and the UK and US component teams.
Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit and Risk Committee
In January 2025, we reported to the Audit and Risk Committee that:
￮ the valuation of complex and long-dated derivative contracts executed by the Gas & Power T&S function were materially correct and the related unrealised gains 
and losses have been recorded appropriately in the financial statements; 
￮ we reported that Shell's key accounting judgments and the application of their accounting policies, including the accounting treatment of non-standard contractual 
terms, were consistent with the requirements set out in IFRS 9;
￮ we highlighted that the accounting judgement around LNG liquidity was a significant judgement. We stated that it is appropriate that Shell do not account for their 
LNG contracts as derivatives and therefore do not reflect these at fair value. This was based on Shell's net settlement history (there is no significant past practice of 
net settlement within Shell's LNG portfolio) and market liquidity (indicators do not demonstrate any increase in liquidity in 2024 mid/long term contracts continue 
to dominate the market); and
￮ we did not identify fictitious or omitted positions as of the balance sheet date.
See the "Audit and Risk Committee Report" on pages 176-187 for details on how the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the Trading and Supply's control framework. Also see Note 26 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements".
There were no changes from the prior year as to the Key Audit Matters included in our auditor's report.

7. Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing the audit and in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on our audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
 
Overall materiality
What we mean
We define materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our procedures.
Level set
Group materiality
We set our preliminary overall materiality for Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements 
at $2.0 billion (2023: $2.0 billion). We kept this under review throughout the year and 
reassessed the appropriateness of our original assessment in the light of Shell's results 
and external market conditions. We did not find it necessary to revise our level of 
overall materiality.
Parent Company materiality
We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $2.0 billion 
(2023: $2.0 billion), which is 0.8% of equity (2023: 0.7%). We concluded 
that equity remains an appropriate basis to determine materiality for 
an investment holding company. The range we normally apply when 
determining materiality on an equity measurement basis is 1- 2%. 
We applied a lower percentage to align the materiality of the Parent 
Company with that of the Group.
Our basis of determining materiality
Our assessment of overall materiality that we applied throughout the year was $2.0 billion, which represented 4.3% (2023: 4.7%) of the three-year normalised 
Adjusted Earnings pre-tax (see table below). Our approach is the same as that applied in 2023.
Where we measure materiality on a pre-tax earnings basis, we normally apply 5% of the measure. Applying this to the three-year normalised Adjusted pre-tax 
earnings would indicate materiality of $2.3 billion. In deciding on an appropriate planning materiality to apply in the Shell audit, we judgementally selected 
$2.0 billion which is consistent with our planning materiality applied in our 2023 audit.
Our materiality was derived from an average of Shell's earnings for 2022-2024, including an initial estimate of the 2024 result, on an Adjusted Earnings basis, 
which we then adjusted for an average effective tax rate. At the end of the year, we reassessed materiality based on the actual results for 2024. As disclosed 
within Non-GAAP measures reconciliations within Additional Information, the "Adjusted Earnings" measure aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's 
financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of non-recurring 
gains and charges disclosed as identified items. Shell's identified items are disclosed within Additional Information, Non-GAAP measures reconciliations, in the 
section Identified items.
Our key criterion in determining materiality remains our perception of the needs of Shell's stakeholders. We consider which earnings, activity or capital-based measure 
aligns best with their expectations. In so doing, we apply a 'reasonable investor perspective', which reflects our understanding of the common financial information 
needs of the members of Shell as a group. 
In our view these needs are best met by basing materiality on normalised Adjusted Earnings on a pre-tax basis. Through applying a normalised earnings approach, 
large year-on-year swings in materiality are minimised. These swings would be driven primarily by price fluctuations rather than specific structural changes to Shell's 
business. In addition, an Adjusted Earnings approach is consistent with the presentation of Shell's segment earnings, which is the earnings measure used by the CEO 
for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
We have considered alternative benchmarks to Adjusted Earnings, including profit before taxation and EBITDA. These indicate a range of $1.45 billion to $2.1 billion. 
By applying a normalised Adjusted Earnings approach, we have concluded that it is appropriate to apply a materiality of $2.0 billion (2023: $2.0 billion).
The Adjusted Earnings were as follows:
 
$ billion 2024 2023 2022
Adjusted Earnings*  23.7  28.2  39.9 
Tax impact based on the average effective tax rate  15.0  13.7  18.5 
Adjusted Earnings pre-tax  38.7  41.9  58.4 
Materiality percentage on the average Adjusted Earnings pre-tax - 2022-2024 4.3%
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).

7. Our application of materiality continued
 
Performance materiality
What we mean
Having established overall materiality, we determined 'performance materiality', which represents our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account. It is 
calculated as a percentage of overall materiality in order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceed overall materiality of $2.0 billion for Shell's financial statements as a whole. We assigned performance materiality to our various in-scope 
operating units. The performance materiality allocation is dependent on the size of the operating unit, measured by its contribution of earnings to Shell, or other 
appropriate metric, and the risk associated with the operating unit.
Level set
In our assessment for 2024, we considered the nature, number and impact of the audit differences identified in 2023 and the Group's overall control environment. 
Based on our assessment of these factors, our judgement was that performance materiality for the 2024 audit should be 75% (2023: 75%) of our overall materiality 
or $1.5 billion (2023: $1.5 billion). 
The level of materiality that we applied in undertaking our audit work at the operating unit level, for the purpose of responding to the assessed risks of material 
misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, was determined by applying a percentage of our total performance materiality. This percentage is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the operating unit to Shell as a whole and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at that operating unit. In 2024 the range 
of materiality applied at the operating unit level was $220 million to $970 million (2023: $225 million to $975 million). 
The performance materiality was kept under ongoing review, but the conclusion remained unchanged at our year-end re-assessment of materiality. 
Audit difference reporting threshold
What we mean
This is the amount below which identified misstatements are clearly trivial. The threshold is the level above which we collate and report audit differences to 
the Audit and Risk Committee. We also report differences below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any 
uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations 
in forming our opinion.
Level set
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences more than $100 million (2023: $100 million), as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. This represents 5% of our planning materiality (2023: 5%).

8. Our scope of the audit of Shell's financial statements 
What we mean
We are required to establish an overall audit strategy that sets the scope, timing, and direction of our audit. Audit scope comprises the physical locations, 
operating units, activities, and processes to be audited that, in aggregate, are expected to provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to express 
an audit opinion.
In the current year our audit scoping has been updated to reflect the new requirements of ISA (UK) 600 (Revised). We have followed a risk-based approach when 
developing our audit approach to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base our audit opinion. We performed risk assessment procedures, with 
input from our component auditors, to identify and assess risks of material misstatement of the Group financial statements and identified significant accounts and 
disclosures.
 
Criteria for determining our audit scope and selection of in-scope operating units
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determined our audit scope for each operating unit within 
Shell which, when taken together, enabled us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Our audit effort was focused towards higher risk areas, 
such as management judgements and on operating units that we considered significant based upon size, complexity or risk.
We assessed our 2024 audit scope following the completion of our 2023 audit. We identified those Areas of Operation (AoOs or operating units) that were 
significant by virtue of their contribution to Shell's results or significant by virtue of their associated risk or complexity. In identifying the AoOs where we would 
performed audit procedures, we considered our understanding of Shell and its operating environment, the potential impact of climate change on the AoO, the group's 
system of internal control at the entity level, centralised processes and IT applications. We also considered the history or expectation of unusual or complex 
transactions, potential for material misstatements, the previous effectiveness of controls, our fraud assessment and internal audit findings. We then considered the 
adequacy of account coverage and remaining audit risk of AoOs not directly covered by audit procedures. Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of our audit 
scope by comparing to the prior year; ensured that there was sufficient unpredictability in our scope and made the necessary changes where appropriate. We 
applied our Risk Scan analytics techniques, which consolidate internal and external data to inform us on higher risk components to be included in scope. This allowed 
us to risk rate the group's operating units. We identified 87 operating units where we believed that it was appropriate to carry out targeted testing. 
By following this approach, our audit effort focused on higher risk areas, such as management judgements. Our group wide procedures enabled us to obtain audit 
evidence over the AoOs that were not full, specific or specified procedure scope.
We did not make substantial changes to our 2023 assessment of the components where we performed audit procedures. Also, there were no significant changes 
to the number of IT applications we tested. 
We determined that certain centralised audit procedures could be performed in the following audit areas: the impact of climate change and the energy transition; 
estimation of oil and gas reserves; impairment assessment of property plant and equipment (PP&E) and joint ventures and associates (JVAs); and accounting for 
complex transactions within Shell's Gas and Power trading and supply function and the valuation of physical and financial derivatives.
We identified 23 components as individually relevant to the Group due to significant risk or an area of higher assessed risk of material misstatement of the group 
financial statements being associated with the components.
For those individually relevant components, we identified the significant accounts where audit work was required to be performed at these components by applying 
professional judgement. This was done having considered the significant accounts on which centralised procedures will be performed, the reasons for identifying the 
financial reporting component as an individually relevant component and the size of the component's account balance relative to the group significant financial 
statement account balance.
We considered whether the remaining group significant account balances not yet subject to audit procedures, in aggregate, could give rise to a risk of material 
misstatement of the group financial statements. No additional components of the group were included in our audit scope to address these risks. 
Having identified the components for which work will be performed, we determined the scope to assign to each component. 
Our scoping to address the risk of material misstatement for each key audit matter is set out in the Key audit matters section of our report.
We kept our audit scope under review throughout the year to reflect changes in Shell's underlying business and risks; however, no significant changes were required. 
The table below illustrates the scope of work performed by our audit teams:
 
Operating units 2024 2023 No. of countries Basis of inclusion Extent of procedures
Full scope 7 7 6 Size and significant risk Complete financial information
Specific scope 49 34 15 Significant risk or higher risk estimates Individual account balances
Specified procedures
1
31 53 14 Other risk factors Individual transactions or processes
Other procedures 893 818 103 Residual risk of error Supplementary audit procedures
2
Total 980 912
1 These procedures were performed by components and at the group level, to address specified risks of the audit or for audit coverage purposes.
2 We performed supplementary audit procedures in relation to Shell's centralised group accounting and reporting processes. These included, but were not limited to, addressing the implications 
of significant and complex accounting matters across all operating units, procedures over revenue to cash process analytics, review of impairment or impairment reversal indicators by 
segments, procedures over the forecasts as they relate to deferred tax asset recoverability and review of pension scheme assumptions, procedures over unusual accounting transactions 
including trading mark-to-market valuations, acquisitions, divestments and redundancies, addressing the appropriate elimination of intercompany balances and the completeness of provisions 
for litigation and other claims, including those related to non-compliance with laws and regulations. We performed testing of both manual and consolidation journal entries throughout the 
year, homogenous processes, and controls at the Business Service Centres (BSCs) and testing of group wide IT systems. We performed a disaggregated analytical review on each financial 
statement line item and also tested Shell's analytical procedures performed at a group, segment and function level.

8. Our scope of the audit of Shell's financial statements continued
 
Group evaluation, review and oversight of component teams
The group engagement partner and Senior Statutory Auditor, Gary Donald, has overall responsibility for the direction, supervision and performance of the Shell audit 
engagement in compliance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. He is supported by segment and function partners and, 
who together with related staff, comprise the integrated group engagement team. This group engagement team established the overall group audit strategy, 
communicated with component auditors, performed work on the consolidation process, and evaluated the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence as the basis for 
forming EY's opinion on the group financial statements. 
The group engagement team is responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating and reviewing the work of EY global network firms operating under their instruction 
(local EY teams) to assess whether: 
￮the local EY audit team had the appropriate level of experience;
￮ the work was performed and documented to a sufficiently high standard; 
￮ the local EY audit team demonstrated that they had challenged management sufficiently and had executed their audit procedures with an appropriate level of 
scepticism; and
￮ there is sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the conclusions reached.
Members of the group engagement team provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of our BSC audit teams. Our BSC teams performed centralised testing 
in the BSCs for certain accounts, including revenue, cash and payroll. In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that 
needed to be undertaken at each of the operating units or BSCs by the group engagement team or by auditors from other local EY teams.
For the operating units where the work was performed by local EY auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement of the group engagement team 
to enable us to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained, as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.
The group engagement team provided detailed instructions to our component teams to drive the audit strategy and execution in a coordinated manner. Group audit 
partners physically visited Australia, Brazil, India, Philippines Poland, Singapore and the USA, covering operating units, functions and BSCs. Our visits covered all of 
the T&S component teams and Shell's trading locations. The Senior Statutory Auditor physically visited Australia, India, Poland, Singapore and the USA.
During our visits, we exercised direction, supervision, oversight and review of our overseas EY audit teams. We were satisfied that we have had adequate involvement 
in their work and that we exercised sufficient and appropriate direction to the component teams. 
The group engagement team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers, 
as well as holding formal closing meetings and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. Where relevant, the section on key audit matters 
details the level of involvement we had with component auditors to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group as a whole.
This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.
9. Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report including the Introduction, Strategic Report, Governance, 
Supplementary Information – oil and gas (unaudited), Sustainability Statements and Additional Information sections, other than the consolidated 
financial statements and parent company financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other 
information contained within the Annual Report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the 
financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such 
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement 
in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the 
other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
10. Opinions on Other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
￮ the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
￮ the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

11. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, 
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
￮adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
￮ the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or
￮ certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
￮ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
12. Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance 
Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review 
by the Listing Rules.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance 
Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:
￮Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties 
identified set out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section;
￮ Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate 
set out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section;
￮ Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set 
out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section;
￮ Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section;
￮ Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out in the "Other regulatory and 
statutory information" section;
￮ The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out in 
the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section; and;
￮ The section describing the work of the audit and risk committee set out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section.
13. Responsibilities of the Directors'
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors' responsibilities set out in the "Other regulatory and statutory information" section, the 
Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such 
internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing Shell and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either 
intend to liquidate Shell or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
14. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but 
is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
15. Explanation as to what extent our audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, 
outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility 
for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.
Our approach was as follows:
￮ we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to Shell and determined that the most significant 
are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards, IFRS as issued by the IASB, Companies Act 
2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) and the 
relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which Shell operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws 
and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and 
regulations relating to health and safety, employee matters, environmental, and bribery and corruption practices.

15. Explanation as to what extent our audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
continued
￮we understood how Shell is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, and those responsible for 
legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit and Risk 
Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.
￮ we assessed the susceptibility of Shell's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by embedding forensic 
specialists into our group engagement team. Our forensic specialists worked with the group engagement team to identify the fraud risks across 
various parts of the business. In addition, we utilised internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment for each of the 
countries of operation. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated data analytics across 
manual journal entries into our audit approach. We also considered the possibility of fraudulent or corrupt payments made through third 
parties, gaining a detailed understanding of the Company's monitoring and compliance activities related to vendor screening and due 
diligence. Where deemed appropriate we conducted analytical testing on third party vendors in high-risk jurisdictions. We utilised a suite of 
digital tools in our assessment of fraud and management override including technology that seeks to verify the authenticity of key documents. 
We also conducted specific audit procedures in relation to the risk of bribery, corruption and sanctions compliance across various countries 
of operation determined on a risk-based approach.
￮ based on the results of our risk assessment we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations 
identified above. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journals meeting our defined risk criteria based on our 
understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit and all full and specific scope management; review 
of the volume and nature of complaints received by the whistleblowing hotline during the year; review of internal audit reports issued during the 
year; review of news releases published by external parties; and
￮ if any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were identified, these were communicated to the group engagement team and 
the relevant local EY teams who performed sufficient and appropriate audit procedures, supplemented by audit procedures performed at the 
group level.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at 
frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
16. Other matters we are required to address
Following the recommendation of the Audit and Risk Committee, we were re-appointed by Shell plc's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 21, 
2024, as auditors of Shell to hold office until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, and signed an engagement letter and addendum 
to the engagement signed on January 17, 2024 and July 30, 2024 respectively. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is nine years 
covering periods from our appointment through to the period ending December 31, 2024. 
Our audit opinion is consistent with our additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee explaining the results of our audit.
17. Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
1. Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Shell") have been prepared 
in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable 
to companies reporting under those standards. As applied to Shell, there are no material differences from the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with the IFRS as issued by the IASB. 
As described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention 
except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods. 
The Consolidated Financial Statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on March 25, 2025.
Going concern
These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. In assessing the appropriateness of the 
going concern assumption over the period to June 30, 2026 (the "going concern period"), management has stress-tested Shell's most recent 
financial projections to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering Shell's principal risks, potential downside pressures on 
commodity prices and long-term demand, and cash preservation measures, including reduced future cash capital expenditure and shareholder 
distributions. This assessment confirmed that Shell has adequate cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet its 
obligations as they fall due in order to continue its operations during the going concern period. Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate 
to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates
This Note describes Shell's material accounting policies. It allows for an understanding as to how material transactions, other events and conditions 
are reported. It also describes: (a) judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management makes in applying the policies that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (b) estimations, including assumptions about 
the future, that management makes in applying the policies. The sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are specifically identified as a significant estimate. 
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous financial year. 
Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars (dollars) and comprise the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable 
returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entities. Information about subsidiaries at December 31, 2024, can 
be found in "Appendix 1: Significant subsidiaries and other related undertakings (audited)".

---- Page 248 ----
2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control ceases, using consistent accounting 
policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interest represents 
the proportion of income, other comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the Company's shareholders.
Currency translation 
Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at quarter-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (including those in respect of inter-company balances, unless related to loans 
of a long-term investment nature) are recognised in income unless when recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow or 
net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses in income are presented within interest and other income or within purchases where 
not related to financing. Share capital issued in currencies other than the dollar is translated at the exchange rate at the date of issue. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of non-dollar entities are translated to dollars at year-end rates of exchange, while their statements of 
income, other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at monthly average rates. Prior to January 1, 2023, these currency translations 
were performed at quarterly average rates. This change has no significant impact on Shell's financial reporting. The resulting translation differences 
are recognised as currency translation differences within other comprehensive income. Upon sale of all or part of an interest in, or upon liquidation 
of, an entity, the appropriate portion of cumulative currency translation differences related to that entity is generally recognised in income. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue from sales of oil, natural gas, chemicals and other products is recognised at the transaction price to which Shell expects to be entitled, 
after deducting sales taxes, excise duties and similar levies. For contracts that contain separate performance obligations, the transaction price 
is allocated to those separate performance obligations by reference to their relative stand-alone selling prices. 
Revenue is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the customer. For sales by Integrated Gas and Upstream operations, 
this generally occurs when the product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism; for sales by refining operations, 
it is either when the product is placed onboard a vessel or offloaded from the vessel, depending on the contractually agreed terms; and for sales 
of oil products and chemicals, it is either at the point of delivery or the point of receipt, depending on contractual conditions. 
Revenue resulting from hydrocarbon production from properties in which Shell has an interest with partners in joint arrangements is recognised on 
the basis of Shell's volumes lifted and sold. Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) 
is recognised for those amounts relating to Shell's cost recoveries and Shell's share of the remaining production. Gains and losses on derivative 
contracts and the revenue and costs associated with other contracts that are classified as held primarily for the purpose of being traded are 
reported on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of hydrocarbons under exchange contracts that are 
necessary to obtain or reposition feedstocks for the refinery operations are presented net in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Revenue resulting from arrangements that are not considered contracts with customers is presented as revenue from other sources.
Research and development 
Development costs that are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised as intangible assets. All other research 
and development expenditure is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income as incurred.
Exploration costs 
Hydrocarbon exploration costs are accounted for under the successful efforts method: exploration costs are recognised in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income when incurred, except that exploratory drilling costs, including in respect of the recapitalisation of depreciation, are included 
in property, plant and equipment pending determination of proved reserves. Exploration costs capitalised in respect of exploration wells that are 
more than 12 months old are written off unless: (a) proved reserves are booked; or (b) (i) they have found commercially producible quantities 
of reserves; and (ii) they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way 
or firmly planned for the near future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress the assessing of reserves and the economic 
and operating viability of the project. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill
Recognition
Property, plant and equipment comprise assets owned by Shell, assets held by Shell under lease contracts, and assets operated by Shell as 
contractor in PSCs. They include rights and concessions in respect of properties with proved reserves ("proved properties") and with no proved 
reserves ("unproved properties"). Property, plant and equipment, including expenditure on major inspections, and intangible assets are initially 
recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost where it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits. This includes 
capitalisation of decommissioning and restoration costs associated with provisions for asset retirement (see "provisions"), certain development 
costs (see "research and development") and the effects of associated cash flow hedges (see "financial instruments") as applicable. Interest 
is capitalised as an increase in property, plant and equipment on major capital projects during construction. The accounting for exploration 
costs is described separately (see "exploration costs"). Intangible assets other than goodwill include acquired liquefied natural gas (LNG)
off-take and sales contracts, environmental certificates, power purchase agreements, software costs, retail customer relationships and trademarks. 
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, 
depletion and amortisation (including any impairment). Gains and losses on sale are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amounts of assets sold and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income, within interest and other income.

An asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, which is 
when the sale is highly probable, and it is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary 
for sales of such assets. Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount upon classification and the fair value 
less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale and the associated liabilities are presented separately from other assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once assets are classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than 
goodwill are no longer subject to depreciation or amortisation.
Depreciation, depletion and amortisation
Property, plant and equipment related to hydrocarbon production activities are in principle depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the 
proved developed reserves of the field concerned, other than assets whose useful lives differ from the lifetime of the field which are depreciated 
applying the straight-line method. For certain Integrated Gas and Upstream assets, the use of proved developed reserves, which are determined 
using the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated yearly average oil and gas prices, could result in depreciation charges for these 
assets which do not reflect the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed as, for example, it may result in assets 
with long-term expected lives having accelerated or being fully depreciated within one year. Therefore, in these instances, other approaches are 
applied to determine a reserves base for the purpose of calculating depreciation, such as using management's expectations of future oil and gas 
prices rather than yearly average prices and using total proved reserves to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that more 
appropriately reflects the expected utilisation of the assets concerned. (See Note 12).
Rights and concessions in respect of proved properties are depleted on the unit-of-production basis over the total proved reserves of the relevant 
area. Where individually insignificant, unproved properties may be grouped and depreciated based on factors such as the average concession 
term and past experience of recognising proved reserves. 
Property, plant and equipment held under lease contracts, capitalised LNG off-take and sales contracts and power purchase agreements 
are depreciated or amortised over the term of the respective contract. Other property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than 
goodwill are depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. They include energy and chemicals parks (for 
which the useful life is generally 20 years), retail service stations (for which the useful life is generally 15 years) and major inspection costs, 
which are depreciated over the estimated period before the next planned major inspection (three to five years). Estimates of the useful lives and 
residual values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
On classification of an asset as held for sale, depreciation ceases. 
Impairment
Intangible assets other than goodwill and assets other than unproved properties (see "Exploration costs") are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication of 
impairment exists, the carrying amounts of those assets are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less
costs of disposal (see "Fair value measurements") and value in use.
Value in use is determined as the amount of estimated risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash-
generating units based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows. Estimates of future cash flows used in the evaluation of 
impairment of assets are made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with 
operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly related to CO₂, and forecast product, refining and chemical margins. In addition, 
management takes into consideration the expected useful lives of the manufacturing facilities, exploration and production assets, and expected 
production volumes. The latter takes into account assessments of field and reservoir performance and includes expectations about both proved 
reserves and volumes that are expected to constitute proved reserves in the future (unproved volumes), which are risk-weighted utilising 
geological, production, recovery and economic projections. Cash flow projections are based on management's most recent Operating Plan that 
represents management's best estimate and are risked as appropriate. The discount rate is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC). Using a post-tax discount rate to calculate value in use does not result in a materially different outcome than using a pre-tax 
discount rate. (See Note 13).
Impairments are reversed as applicable to the extent that the events or circumstances that triggered the original impairment have changed.
Impairment losses and reversals are reported within depreciation, depletion and amortisation.
Upon classification of an asset as held for sale, the carrying amount is impaired if this exceeds the fair value less costs to sell.

Judgements and estimates
Proved oil and gas reserves
Unit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are principally measured based on management's estimates of proved 
developed oil and gas reserves. Exploration drilling costs are capitalised pending the results of further exploration or appraisal activity 
(successful efforts method), which may take place for several years before the final investment decision on a development project is taken 
and before any related proved reserves can be booked. 
Proved reserves are estimated by internal qualified professionals. The proved reserves are estimated with reasonable certainty by analysis 
of available geological and engineering data at the time of the estimation, and only include volumes for which access to market is assured 
with reasonable expectation. Yearly average oil and gas prices are used for the estimation of proved reserves unless prices are defined by 
contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Proved reserves are subject to regular revision, both upward 
or downward, based on new information from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing 
conditions, updates of development plans and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms, legislation or 
development plans.
Changes to estimates of proved developed reserves affect prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged 
and, consequently, the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets. Generally, in the normal course of business the diversity 
of the asset portfolio will limit the net effect of such revisions. The outcome of, or assessment of plans for, exploration or appraisal activity 
may result in the related capitalised exploration drilling costs being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in that period. 
Judgement is involved in determining when to use an alternative reserves base in order to appropriately reflect the expected utilisation 
of the assets concerned (see "Depreciation, depletion and amortisation"). 
Information about the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets and the amounts charged to the Consolidated Statement 
of Income, including depreciation, depletion and amortisation and the quantitative impact of the use of an alternative reserves base, 
is presented in Note 12. 
Impairment 
For the purposes of determining whether impairment of assets has occurred, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal, the key 
assumptions management uses in estimating risk-adjusted future cash flows for value in use measures are future oil and gas prices and product 
margins, including refining and chemical margins. In addition, management uses other assumptions, such as potential costs associated with 
operational GHG emissions, market supply and demand, expected production volumes and forecast expenditure. These assumptions and the 
judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Changes in assumptions 
could affect the carrying amounts of assets, and any impairment losses and reversals will affect income. Changes in economic conditions can 
affect the rate used to discount future cash flow estimates or the risk adjustment in the future cash flows. Judgement is applied to conclude 
whether changes in assumptions or economic conditions are an indicator that an asset may be impaired or that an impairment loss 
recognised in prior periods may no longer exist, or may have decreased. 
Expected production volumes, which comprise proved reserves and unproved volumes, are used for impairment testing because management 
believes this to be the most appropriate indicator of expected future cash flows. Reserves estimates are inherently imprecise. Furthermore, 
projections about unproved volumes are based on information that is necessarily less robust than that available for mature reservoirs. 
Estimation is involved with respect to the expected life of energy and chemicals parks, including management's view on the future 
development of refining margins. 
The determination of cash-generating units requires judgement. Changes in this determination could impact the calculation of value in use 
and therefore the conclusion on the recoverability of assets' carrying amounts when performing an impairment test. 
Judgement, which is subject to change as new information becomes available, can be required in determining when an asset is classified 
as held for sale. A change in that judgement could result in impairment charges affecting income, depending on whether classification 
requires a write-down of the asset to its fair value less costs to sell. 
Significant estimates 
In assessing the value in use, the estimated risk-adjusted future post-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax 
discount rate that reflects Shell's post-tax WACC. (See Note 13). The level of risking reflected in the cash flow assumptions is a consideration 
in management's assessment of the discount rate to be applied in order to avoid duplication of systemic and asset-specific risking in 
calculating value in use, and to ensure the discount rate applied is commensurate with risks included in forecast cash flows.
Assumptions about future commodity prices and refining and chemical margins used in the impairment testing in, respectively, Integrated 
Gas and Upstream, and Chemicals and Products (see Note 13) are regularly assessed by management, noting that management does not 
necessarily consider short-term increases or decreases in prices as being indicative of long-term levels. 
The price methodology applied is based on Shell management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals 
in the near term, taking into account various other factors such as industry rationalisation and energy transition in the long term.
The discount rate, future commodity prices and refining margins used in impairment testing provide a source of estimation uncertainty as 
referred to in paragraph 125 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS 1.125).
Information about the carrying amounts of assets and impairments and their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in Note 13.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for any non-controlling 
interest over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date. The amount 
recognised for any non-controlling interest is measured as a percentage of the identified net assets of the acquiree based on the present 
ownership's proportionate share. At the acquisition date, acquired goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit (CGU), or groups of CGUs, 
expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. The CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level at which the goodwill 
will be monitored and managed. 
Goodwill is not amortised and is subsequently measured at the initial amount recognised less any accumulated impairment losses. (See Note 11).
Impairment 
The carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable 
amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates. An impairment loss is recognised when the CGU's recoverable amount is lower than its 
carrying amount. (See Note 13).
Previously recognised impairment losses of goodwill are not reversed subsequently.
Leases
A contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for payments to 
be made to the owners (lessors) is accounted for as a lease. Contracts are assessed to determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the 
inception of a contract or when the terms and conditions of a contract are significantly changed. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a 
lease, together with contractual options to extend or to terminate the lease early, where it is reasonably certain that an extension option will be 
exercised or a termination option will not be exercised.
At the commencement of a lease contract, a lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use asset are recognised, unless the lease term is 12 
months or less. The commencement date of a lease is the date on which the underlying asset is made available for use. The lease liability is 
measured at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The lease liability 
includes contingent rentals and variable lease payments that depend on an index, rate, or where they are fixed payments in substance. The lease 
liability is remeasured when the contractual cash flows of variable lease payments change due to a change in an index or rate when the lease 
term changes following a reassessment.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate is not readily available, the incremental borrowing rate 
is applied. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a 
similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.
In general, a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any pre-paid 
lease payment relating to the specific lease contract. The depreciation on right-of-use assets is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income unless capitalised as exploration drilling cost (see "exploration cost") or capitalised when the right-of-use asset is used to construct 
another asset.
Where Shell is the lessor in a lease arrangement at inception, the lease arrangement will be classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. 
Classification is based on the extent to which the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset lie with the lessor or the lessee.
Where Shell, usually in its capacity as operator, has entered into a lease contract on behalf of a joint arrangement, a lease liability is recognised 
to the extent that Shell has primary responsibility for the lease liability. A finance sublease is subsequently recognised if the related right-of-use 
asset is subleased to the joint arrangement. This is usually the case when the joint arrangement has the right to direct the use and obtains 
substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset.
Impairment of the right-of-use asset
Right-of-use assets are subject to existing impairment requirements as set out in "Property, plant and equipment", above, and as presented
in Note 13.
Judgements and estimates 
A lease term includes optional lease periods where it is reasonably certain Shell will exercise the option to extend or not exercise the option 
to terminate the lease. Determination of the lease term is subject to judgement and has an impact on the measurement of the lease liability 
and related right-of-use asset. When assessing the lease term at the commencement date, Shell takes into consideration the broader 
economics of the contract. Reassessment of the lease term is performed upon changes in circumstances that may affect the probability 
that an option to extend or to terminate the lease will be exercised.
Where the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects 
the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Determination of the incremental borrowing 
rate requires estimation.

Joint arrangements and associates 
Arrangements under which Shell has contractually agreed to share control (see "Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements" for 
the definition of control) with another party or parties are joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, 
or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Investments 
in entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are classified as associates. Information about 
incorporated joint arrangements and associates at December 31, 2024, can be found in "Appendix 1: Significant subsidiaries and other 
related undertakings (audited)".
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognised at 
cost and subsequently adjusted for the Shell share of post-acquisition income less dividends received and the Shell share of other comprehensive 
income and other movements in equity, together with any loans of a long-term investment nature. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of Shell. In an exchange of assets 
and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the non-Shell share of any excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred over 
the pre-exchange carrying amounts is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Unrealised gains on other transactions between 
Shell and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of Shell's interest in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly but 
may also result in an assessment of whether the asset transferred is impaired. 
Shell recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly and liabilities incurred 
jointly with other partners. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost comprises direct purchase costs (including transportation), 
and associated costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present condition and location, and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method for oil, gas and chemicals and by the weighted average cost method for materials. 
Taxation
The charge for current tax is calculated based on the income reported by the Company and its subsidiaries, as adjusted for items that are
non-taxable or disallowed and using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is determined, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and on unused tax losses and credits carried forward. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when an asset 
is realised or a liability is settled. They are not recognised where they arise on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a 
transaction (other than in a business combination) that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, or in respect 
of taxable temporary differences associated with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the respective temporary 
difference can be controlled by Shell and it is probable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward can be utilised. 
Income tax receivables and payables as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities include provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments. 
Income taxes are recognised in income except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. Income tax assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except 
where there is a right of offset within fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle such balances on a net basis.
Judgements and estimates 
Tax liabilities are recognised when it is probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a taxing authority. In such cases, a 
provision is made for the amount expected to be settled, provided it can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for uncertain income tax 
positions/treatments are measured at the most likely amount or the expected value method, depending on which method better predicts 
the resolution of the uncertainty. Generally, uncertain tax treatments are assessed on an individual basis unless they are expected to 
be settled collectively. It is assumed that taxing authorities will examine positions taken if they have the right to do so and have full 
knowledge of the relevant information. Changes in estimates regarding the likelihood of a future outflow of funds or the expected 
amount to be settled are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which the change occurs. This process 
requires the application of judgement, which can change over time depending on new facts and circumstances. Judgements primarily 
relate to transfer pricing, including inter-company financing, interpretation of PSCs, deductible expenditure for tax purposes, and taxation 
arising from disposal.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Judgements and estimates continued 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an 
assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available 
to offset the assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. 
To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the amounts recognised in 
respect of deferred tax assets as well as in the amounts recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs. 
Taxation information, including charges and deferred tax assets and liabilities, is presented in Note 23. Income taxes include certain charges 
at higher rates levied on income from certain Integrated Gas and Upstream activities. 
Retirement benefits 
Benefits in the form of retirement pensions and health care and life insurance are provided to certain employees and retirees under defined benefit 
and defined contribution plans.
Obligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which takes into 
account employees' years of service and, for pensions, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using 
interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and of a duration consistent with the 
plan obligations. Where plans are funded, payments are made to independently managed trusts; assets held by those trusts are measured at fair 
value. Defined benefit plan surpluses are recognised as assets to the extent that they are considered recoverable, which is generally by way of 
a refund or lower future employer contributions.
The amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit plans mainly comprise service cost and net interest. Service cost comprises 
principally the increase in the present value of the obligation for benefits resulting from employee service during the period (current service cost) 
and also amounts relating to past service and settlements or amendments of plans. Plan amendments are changes to benefits and are generally 
recognised when all legal and regulatory approvals have been received and the effects have been communicated to members. Net interest is 
calculated using the net defined benefit liability or asset matched against the discount rate yield curve at the beginning of each year for each 
plan. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset resulting from actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding 
the amount recognised in income, are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
For defined contribution plans, pension expense represents the amount of employer contributions payable for the period. 
Significant judgements and estimates 
Defined benefit obligations and plan assets, and the resulting liabilities and assets that are recognised, require significant estimation as these 
are subject to volatility as (actuarial) assumptions regarding future outcomes and market values change. Significant judgement is required 
in determining the actuarial assumptions, which vary for the different plans to reflect local conditions but are determined under a common 
process in consultation with independent actuaries. The assumptions applied in respect of each plan are reviewed annually and adjusted 
where necessary to reflect changes in experience and actuarial recommendations. 
Actuarial assumptions applied in determining defined benefit obligations provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in IAS 1.125.
Information about the amounts reported in respect of defined benefit pension plans, assumptions applicable to the principal plans and their 
sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in Note 24. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised at the balance sheet date at management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. 
Non-current amounts are discounted at a rate intended to reflect the time value of money. The carrying amounts of provisions and the discount 
rate applied are regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts or changes in law, technology or financial markets.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Provisions for decommissioning and restoration costs, which arise principally in connection with hydrocarbon production facilities, oil products 
manufacturing facilities and pipelines, are measured on the basis of current requirements, technology and price levels; the present value is 
calculated using amounts discounted over the useful economic life of the assets. The liability is recognised (together with a corresponding amount 
as part of the related property, plant and equipment) once a legal or constructive obligation arises to dismantle an item of property, plant and 
equipment and to restore the site on which it is located and when a reasonable estimate can be made. The effects of changes resulting from 
revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of the provision are reflected on a prospective basis, generally by adjustment to the 
carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment. However, where there is no related asset, or the change reduces the carrying 
amount to nil, the effect, or the amount in excess of the reduction in the related asset to nil, is recognised in income. 
Shell reviews its energy and chemicals parks on a regular basis to determine whether any changes in assumptions, including expected life, 
trigger the need to recognise a provision for decommissioning and restoration.
Redundancy provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and 
number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs and an appropriate timeline, and the employees affected have been 
notified of the plan's main features. 
An onerous contract provision is recognised when the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic 
benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable cost under a contract is the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any 
compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. 
Before an onerous provision is recognised Shell first recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.
Other provisions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which an obligation arises and the amount can be 
reasonably estimated. Provisions are measured based on current legal requirements and existing technology where applicable. Recognition 
of any joint and several liability is based on management's best estimate of the final pro rata share of the liability. Provisions are determined 
independently of expected insurance recoveries. Recoveries are recognised when virtually certain of realisation. 
Estimates 
Estimates of provisions for future decommissioning and restoration costs are recognised and based on current legal and constructive 
requirements, technology and price levels. Because actual cash outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, 
public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions 
are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of such changes. 
Significant estimate
The discount rate applied to reflect the time value of money in the carrying amount of provisions requires estimation. The discount rate used 
in the calculation of provisions is the pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Generally, the market 
assessments of the time value of money can be reflected in the risk-free rate and given the long-term investment nature of oil and gas business, 
Shell considers it appropriate to use the 20-year US Treasury bond yield return as the risk-free rate. The discount rate applied is reviewed 
regularly and adjusted following changes in market rates. 
The discount rate applied to determine the carrying amount of provisions provides a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in IAS 1.125.
Information about decommissioning and restoration provisions and their sensitivity to changes in estimates is presented in Note 25. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a legally enforceable right 
of offset and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income 
or fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets is determined by the contractual cash flows and where applicable the 
business model for managing the financial assets. 
Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost, if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual 
cash flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. It is initially recognised at fair value 
plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Subsequently, the financial asset is 
measured using the effective interest method less any impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired. 
All equity instruments and other debt instruments are recognised at fair value. For equity instruments, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election 
(on an instrument-by-instrument basis) can be made to designate these as at fair value through other comprehensive income instead of fair value 
through profit or loss. Dividends received on equity instruments are recognised as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when Shell benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case such 
gains are recorded in other comprehensive income.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Investments in securities
Investments in securities ("securities") comprise equity and debt securities. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Generally, unrealised holding 
gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive 
income are transferred to retained earnings. Debt securities are generally carried at fair value with unrealised holding gains and losses recognised 
in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in income.
Impairment of financial assets
The expected credit loss model is applied for recognition and measurement of impairments in financial assets measured at amortised cost or at 
fair value through other comprehensive income. The expected credit loss model is also applied for financial guarantee contracts to which IFRS 9 
applies and which are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount 
equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss 
allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. Changes in loss allowances are recognised 
in profit or loss. For trade receivables, a simplified impairment approach is applied recognising expected lifetime losses from initial recognition. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including offsetting bank overdrafts, short-term bank deposits, money market funds, 
reverse repos and similar instruments that generally have a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, such as instruments 
held for trading, or Shell has opted to measure them at fair value through profit or loss. Debt and trade payables are recognised initially at fair 
value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost except for fixed rate debt subject to fair value 
hedging which is remeasured for the hedged risk (see below). Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method, and 
other than interest capitalised, is recognised in income. For financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value option, the change in the fair 
value related to own credit risk is recognised in other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value change is recognised at fair value through 
profit or loss.
Derivative contracts and hedges 
Derivative contracts are used in the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, and foreign currency 
cash balances. Derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract in terms of economic characteristics and risks and the host contract of 
which is not a financial asset are separated from their host contract and recognised at fair value with the associated gains and losses recognised 
in income.
Contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash are accounted for as financial instruments, with the exception of those 
contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Shell's 
expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as 
effective hedging instruments are recognised in income.
Certain derivative contracts qualify and are designated either: as a fair value hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability 
or an unrecognised firm commitment; or as a cash flow hedge for the change in cash flows to be received or paid relating to a recognised asset 
or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction; or as a net investment hedge of the change in foreign exchange rates associated with net 
investments in foreign operations with a different functional currency than Shell's functional currency.
A change in the fair value of a hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recognised in income, together with the consequential 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item. The effective portion of a change in fair value of a derivative contract designated as a 
cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs; any ineffective portion is recognised in income. 
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the initial 
carrying amount of the asset or liability (reclassified to the balance sheet); a net investment hedge is accounted for similarly to a cash flow hedge. 
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income while any 
gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income. On disposal of the foreign operation, 
the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The effective portion of a change due to retranslation at quarter-end exchange rates in the carrying amount of debt and the principal amount of 
derivative contracts used to hedge net investments in foreign operations is recognised in other comprehensive income until the related investment 
is sold or liquidated; any ineffective portion is recognised in income.
All relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are documented, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for 
undertaking hedge transactions. The effectiveness of hedges is also continually assessed and hedge accounting is discontinued when there is 
a change in the risk management strategy.
Unless designated as hedging instruments, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items that can be settled net as if the contracts were financial 
instruments and that do not meet expected own-use requirements (typically, forward sale and purchase contracts for commodities in trading 
operations), and contracts that are or contain written options, are recognised at fair value; associated gains and losses are recognised in income.
Derivatives that are held primarily for the purpose of trading are presented as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Judgement
Judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell LNG are capable of being settled on a net basis. Due to the limited 
liquidity in the LNG market and the lack of net settlement history, contracts to buy or sell LNG are not considered capable of being settled 
on a net basis. As a result, these contracts are accounted for on an accrual basis and not as a financial instrument. 
Fair value measurements
Fair value measurements are estimates of the amounts for which assets or liabilities could be transferred at the measurement date, based on 
the assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use 
into account.
Estimate 
Where available, fair value measurements are derived from prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. In the absence of 
such information, other observable inputs are used to estimate fair value. Inputs derived from external sources are corroborated or otherwise 
verified, as appropriate. In the absence of publicly available information, fair value is determined using estimation techniques that take into 
account market perspectives relevant to the asset or liability, in as far as they can reasonably be ascertained, based on predominantly 
unobservable inputs. For derivative contracts where publicly available information is not available, fair value estimations are generally 
determined using models and other valuation methods, the key inputs for which include future prices, volatility, price correlation, counterparty 
credit risk and market liquidity, as appropriate; for other assets and liabilities, fair value estimations are generally based on the net present 
value of expected future cash flows. 
Share-based compensation plans
The fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) -- 
Shell's main equity-settled plans - is estimated using the average Monte Carlo fair values and is recognised in income from the date of grant over 
the vesting period with a corresponding increase directly in equity. The model projects and averages the results for a range of potential outcomes 
for the vesting conditions, the principal assumptions for which are the share price volatility and dividend yields for Shell and four of its main 
competitors using respectively three years and 10 years of historical data.
Shares held in trust
Shares in the Company, which are held by employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities, are not included in assets but are reflected 
at cost as a deduction from equity as shares held in trust.
Acquisitions and sales of interests in a business 
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed when control is obtained over a business, and when an interest or an additional interest is acquired in 
a joint operation which is a business, are recognised at their fair value at the date of the acquisition; the amount of the purchase consideration 
above this value is recognised as goodwill. When control is obtained, any non-controlling interest is recognised as the proportionate share of the 
identifiable net assets. The acquisition of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and the sale of an interest while retaining control are accounted 
for as transactions within equity. The difference between the purchase consideration or sale proceeds after tax and the relevant proportion of the 
non-controlling interest, measured by reference to the carrying amount of the interest's net assets at the date of acquisition or sale, is recognised 
in retained earnings as a movement in equity attributable to Shell plc shareholders. 
Emission schemes and related environmental programmes
Emission certificates, biofuel certificates and renewable power certificates (together "environmental certificates") held for trading purposes are 
recognised at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower, and classified under inventory.
Emission trading schemes
Emission certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost and classified under intangible assets. In the schemes 
where a cap is set for emissions, the associated emission certificates granted are recognised at cost, which may be zero. An emission liability 
is recognised under other liabilities when actual emissions occur that give rise to an obligation. To the extent the liability is covered by emission 
certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these emission certificates held and for the 
remaining uncovered portion at market value. The associated expense is presented under "Production and manufacturing expenses". Both 
the emission certificates and the emission liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.
Biofuel programmes
Biofuel certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost under intangible assets. Self-generated biofuel 
certificates are recognised at nil value, as they primarily offset the obligation. A biofuel liability is recognised under other liabilities when the 
obligation arises under local regulations. To the extent covered by biofuel certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with 
reference to the value of these certificates held and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. The associated expense is presented 
under "purchases". Biofuel certificates and the biofuel liability are both derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.

2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates continued
Renewable power programmes
Renewable power certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost as an intangible asset. Self-generated renewable 
power certificates are generally transferred to the customer upon sales of electricity. A renewable power liability is recognised under other 
liabilities when electricity sales take place that give rise to an obligation to retire renewable power certificates. The associated cost is recognised 
in "purchases" in the income statement. If the obligation relates to power consumed in business operations, it is presented in other liabilities with 
cost reflected in "Production and manufacturing expenses". To the extent covered by renewable power certificates held for compliance purposes, 
the liability is measured with reference to the value of these renewable power certificates and for the remaining uncovered portion at market 
value. Renewable power certificates and the renewable power liability are derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.
Consolidated Statement of Income presentation 
Purchases reflect all costs related to the acquisition of inventories and the effects of the changes therein, and include associated costs incurred 
in conversion into finished or intermediate products. Production and manufacturing expenses are the costs of operating, maintaining and 
managing production and manufacturing assets. Selling, distribution and administrative expenses include direct and indirect costs of marketing 
and selling products.
3. Changes to IFRS not yet adopted
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements ("IFRS 18")
IFRS 18 was issued in April 2024 and will replace IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 will be effective for reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2027. This standard sets out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial 
statements, particularly the Consolidated Statement of Income. The standard introduces a defined structure for the Consolidated Statement 
of Income, additional defined subtotals, new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information, and it mandates disclosures about 
management-defined performance measures. 
IFRS 18 will have no impact on recognition and measurement. From Shell's initial impact assessment, it has concluded that the impact will be 
limited to disclosure and presentation in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The primary change will be that the share of profit from joint 
ventures and associates will be classified in the Consolidated Statement of Income under the investing category (income generated by the 
investment) instead of the operating category. As a result of this change, the dividends received from joint ventures and associates will 
be reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows from cash flow from operating activities (CFFO) to cash flow from investing 
activities (CFFI). 
4. Climate change and energy transition
This note describes how Shell has considered climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial statements and how this translates into 
the valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities as Shell makes progress in the energy transition. The note is structured as follows:

4. Climate change and energy transition continued
Note 2 Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates describes uncertainties, including those that have the potential to have a material effect 
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the next 12 months. This note describes the key areas of climate impacts that potentially have short-, medium- and 
longer-term effects on amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024. Where relevant, this note contains references to 
other notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and aims to provide an overarching summary of the energy transition impact. 
In 2021, Shell launched its strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. The strategy aims to deliver more value with less 
emissions. Shell's targets include those related to its own operations: halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a net basis under operational control by 
2030, compared with 2016 baseline, achieve methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030, and 
eliminate routine gas flaring by 2025. [A] In relation to emissions from the products we sell, Shell has a target to reduce the net carbon intensity 
of energy products sold by 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, compared with a 2016 baseline and an ambition, set in March 
2024, to reduce customer emissions (Scope 3, Category 11) related to the use of oil products sold by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021. [B]
[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased routine flaring. 
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[B] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
Financial planning and assumptions
This section provides an overview of key assumptions used for financial planning related to climate change and the energy transition. These 
assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in these financial statements -- such as future oil and gas prices, future chemical and refining 
margins, discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, carbon emission cost and deferred tax assets -- take climate change and 
energy transition into account and are similarly used for impairment testing of carrying values of assets. The areas described focus on those most 
pertinent to Shell's business and how financial planning and assumptions interact with scenarios. Subsequently, the sensitivity of carrying values 
to commodity prices, carbon emission costs, chemical and refining margins, discount rates and demand, if different assumptions were applied, 
is described.
There is no one single scenario that underpins the financial statements. Shell Scenarios are not predictions. They are designed to stretch 
management's thinking when it comes to considering events that may be possible, even if only remotely. As a result, these scenarios are not 
intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and are not the basis for Shell's financial statements and Operating Plans. 
Shell Scenarios and the range of possible outcomes inform the development of Shell's strategy and Shell's view on future oil and gas price 
outlooks, refining margins and chemical margins. The oil and gas price outlooks are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's financial 
statements. Shell's scenarios inform high-, mid- and low-price outlooks. The mid-price outlook represents management's reasonable best estimate 
and is the basis for Shell's financial statements, Operating Plans and impairment testing. Impairment testing applies management's reasonable 
best estimates across the full life cycle of assets, which may go beyond the Operating Plan period.
Shell's targets — including to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a net basis [C] by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 baseline, and 
a 15-20% reduction of net carbon intensity [D] by 2030 — have been included in the Operating Plan. The Operating Plan also includes expected 
costs for evolving carbon regulations (see "Carbon price sensitivities" below) based on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions from 
operated and non-operated assets, also taking into account the estimated impact of free allowances. For impairment testing purposes, key 
assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, such as future oil and gas prices, refining margins, 
chemical margins, discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, carbon emission cost and tax rates, all go beyond the 
planning horizon in the Operating Plan and do take climate change and energy transition into account.

[D] GHG emissions based on the energy product sales included in the net carbon intensity (NCI) using equity boundary.

[A] Following resegmentation in 2024 (see Note 7), prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact between Marketing and 
Chemicals & Products segments.
For Integrated Gas and Upstream, sensitivity to commodity prices and carbon prices has been tested (see below) covering the carrying amount 
of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and joint ventures and associates. Sensitivity testing was performed applying 
alternative price scenarios to the forecasted cash flows for the whole period until the end of life of the asset tested. For Chemicals and Products, 
sensitivity to chemical margins, refining margins and carbon prices has been tested (see below). Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions 
are expected to be resilient through the energy transition with limited exposure of stranded assets. 
In addition, sensitivity to changes in the discount rate applied in impairment testing has also been tested (see below).
In calculating recoverable value, key assumptions are not determined in isolation to ensure relevant interdependencies are appropriately 
reflected. In particular, management considers the relationship between discount rates, forecast commodity prices and cash flow risking to 
ensure impairment testing assumptions result in an implicit expected return that is balanced and appropriate for the asset under review. Each 
of the sensitivities described above has been tested under a ceteris paribus assumption where all other factors remain unchanged, and, as such, 
does not reflect the potential offsetting effects of corresponding changes in other assumptions.

Carrying value of Integrated Gas 
and Upstream assets
$ billion as at December 31
Carrying value of production assets
$ billion as at December 31
Carrying value of exploration and 
evaluation assets
$ billion as at December 31
Within Integrated Gas and Upstream, the assets potentially most sensitive to the energy transition are production assets and exploration and 
evaluation assets. Both production assets of $102 billion and exploration and evaluation assets of $4 billion are recognised within Property, 
plant and equipment within Integrated Gas and Upstream.
Portfolio composition and changes
Since 2016, the carrying value of production assets in Integrated Gas and Upstream decreased from $169 billion as at December 31, 2016, 
to $102 billion as at December 31, 2024. Over this period, depreciation was higher than additions for each year, and disposals of property, 
plant and equipment with a carrying value of $26 billion occurred. The carrying value of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenses 
decreased from $19 billion as at December 31, 2016, to $4 billion at December 31, 2024. This is the result of final investment decisions, 
reclassifications to production assets and amounts charged to expenses exceeding additions.

Estimated useful life
The energy transition and the pace at which it progresses may impact the remaining life of assets. Integrated Gas and Upstream assets are 
generally depreciated using a unit-of-production methodology where depreciation generally depends on production of SEC proved reserves. 
(See Note 2). Based on production plans of existing assets, 49%, 7% and 1% of SEC proved reserves as at December 31, 2024, would currently 
be left by 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. Based on the unit-of-production depreciation methodology applied, the carrying value for 
individual assets are depreciated to nil in the same pattern as the depletion of reserves towards nil. An analysis of Integrated Gas and Upstream 
production assets of $102 billion as at December 31, 2024, based on planned reserves depletion shows that these assets would be significantly 
further depreciated under the unit-of-production method by 2030 and nearly fully depreciated by 2050. This provides a further perspective on 
the risk of stranded assets carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024. 
Price sensitivities using climate pricelines
As noted, in accordance with IFRS, Shell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent 
management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. The mid-price outlook informed 
by Shell's scenario planning represents management's best estimate. A change of -10% or +10% to the mid-price outlook, as an average 
percentage over the whole life cycle of assets, would result in around $5-9 billion (2023: $5-8 billion) impairment or $2-5 billion
(2023: $2-5 billion) impairment reversal respectively in Integrated Gas and Upstream (see Note 13).
The energy transition will continue to bring volatility and there is significant uncertainty as to how commodity prices will develop over the next 
decades. Some pricelines see a structurally lower price during the transition period, while other pricelines see structurally higher commodity prices 
as a result of changes in supply and demand. As the risk of stranded assets is prevalent with downside price risk in energy transition scenarios, 
sensitivities have only been undertaken for such downside scenarios. If different price outlooks from external and often normative climate change 
scenarios were used, this would impact the recoverability of certain assets recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 
2024. These external scenarios are not representative of management's mid-price reasonable best estimate.
Sensitivity of carrying value to commodity prices described below is under the assumption that all other factors in the models used -- such as cost 
levels, volumes, mid-price CO2 assumptions and the discount rate -- to calculate recoverability of carrying value remains unchanged. Sensitivity 
testing has been performed by applying the alternative commodity price scenarios to cash flows for the whole period until the end of life of the 
assets tested, which may extend beyond the Operating Plan period. The alternative commodity prices were applied in the local cash flow models 
and thereafter aggregated by segment. Changes to commodity prices are applied because of the significant impact on Shell's business. It should 
be noted that a significant decrease in long-term forecasted commodity prices would probably lead to further changes, such as in portfolio choices 
and cost levels.
Sensitivity to changes in commodity prices in value in use calculations has been tested as follows:
Priceline 1 – Average prices from three 1.5-2°C external climate change scenarios: in view of the broad range of price outlooks across the various 
scenarios, the average of three external price outlooks was taken.
￮ IHS Markit/ACCS 2024 – under this scenario oil prices (real terms 2024 (RT24)) decrease from $110 per barrel (/b) in 2025 to around 
$100/b in 2026-2027. From 2028 prices gradually decrease from $50/b towards $31/b in 2037, gradually recovering to $92/b in 2048 
with a subsequent decrease towards $90/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT24) are around $3 per million British thermal units (/MMBtu) until 2042 
and gradually increase towards $4/MMBtu until 2050 for Henry Hub. For Europe, prices decrease from $10/MMBtu in 2025 towards around 
$4/MMBtu in 2032, with a subsequent increase to some $5/MMBtu until 2050. For Asia, prices decrease from $11/MMBtu in 2025 towards 
around $6/MMBtu in 2033, and gradually increase towards $7/MMBtu until 2050.
￮ Woodmac WM AET-1.5 degree – under this scenario oil prices (RT24) gradually decrease from $64/b in 2025 towards $28/b in 2050. 
Gas prices (RT24) increase from $3/MMBtu in 2025 towards around $4/MMBtu until 2035, staying on that level until 2050 for Henry Hub. 
For Europe, gas prices (RT24) decrease gradually from around $13/MMBtu in 2025 to some $6/MMBtu in 2030, then gradually increase 
towards $9/MMBtu in 2035 and subsequently decrease towards $6/MMBtu in 2050. For Asia, gas prices decrease from $14/MMBtu in 
2025 to $7/MMBtu in 2030, subsequently increasing to $10/MMBtu around 2036 and subsequently decreasing towards $7/MMBtu in 
2050.
￮ IEA NZE50 – under this scenario oil prices (RT24) gradually decrease from $72/b in 2025 towards some $26/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT24) 
decrease from some $3/MMBtu in 2025 to around $2/MMBtu until 2050 for Henry Hub. For Europe and Asia, gas prices (RT24) decrease 
from some $10/MMBtu and $11/MMBtu respectively in 2025 to some $4/MMBtu in 2050 for Europe and $5/MMBtu around 2030, for Asia 
staying at that level until 2050.
This average priceline provides an external view of the development of commodity prices under 1.5-2°C external climate change scenarios over 
the whole period under review. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion (2023: $72 billion) and Upstream assets of $77 billion (2023: $84 billion) as 
at December 31, 2024, shows recoverable amounts that are $11-15 billion (2023: $12-16 billion) and $1-3 billion (2023: $3-5 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying value as at December 31, 2024.

4. Climate change and energy transition continued
Priceline–2 - Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: this priceline applies Shell's mid-price outlook for the first 10 years (see Note 13). Because of 
the greater uncertainty for the period after 10 years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied. 
This gives less weight to the price-risk uncertainty in the first 10 years reflected in the Operating Plan period and applies more risk to the more 
uncertain subsequent periods. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion (2023: $72 billion) and Upstream assets of $77 billion (2023: $84 billion) 
as at December 31, 2024, shows recoverable amounts that are $7--10 billion (2023: $8-10 billion) and up to $1 billion (2023: $1-3 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying value as at December 31, 2024. 
Priceline–3 - IEA NZE50: this priceline applies the International Energy Agency normative Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (IEA NZE50) scenario 
over the whole period under review. This priceline has been applied in order to also reflect the sensitivity to a pure net-zero emissions scenario 
from the IEA. 
Applying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion (2023: $72 billion) and Upstream assets of $77 billion (2023: $84 billion) as 
at December 31, 2024, shows recoverable amounts that are $21-27 billion (2023: $15-20 billion) and $5-7 billion (2023: $3-5 billion) lower, 
respectively, than the carrying value as at December 31, 2024. For Integrated Gas the change in sensitivity compared with 2023 is largely 
driven by lower oil and Asia gas prices applied in sensitivity testing for the whole period under review.
Oil price assumptions
[A] The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is a group of 143 central banks and supervisors and 21 observers committed to sharing best practices, contributing to the development 
of climate– and environment–related risk management in the financial sector and mobilising mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy. This scenario results 
from the NGFS GCAM model. This model embodies certain assumptions on the relationships between economic and energy output and climate interactions. This NGFS scenario shows a 
decline in world oil demand relative to the current policies baseline, in part a response to substitution away from fossil fuels. At the same time prices increase due to supply constraints. 
[B] All figures are presented on RT24 basis unless noted differently.
The graph above shows the oil pricelines on a real-terms basis applied for the period until 2050 for Shell's mid-price outlook in comparison 
with the IEA announced pledges (IEA APS) scenario, the NGFS GCAM NZE 2050 scenario, the average prices from three 1.5-2°C external 
climate change scenarios (Priceline 1, above) and the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario (IEA NZE50, Priceline 3 above). The development 
of future oil prices is uncertain and oil prices have been subject to significant volatility in the past. Future oil prices may be impacted by future 
changes in macroeconomic factors, available supply, demand, geopolitical and other factors. The pricelines as per the scenarios NGFS GCAM 
NZE 2050, IEA APS, the average prices from three 1.5-2°C external climate change scenarios and IEA NZE50 differ from Shell's best estimate 
and view of the future oil price.

Carbon price sensitivities
Carbon costs in the Operating Plan
The Operating Plan includes capital expenditure and operating costs to achieve Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets (see above). These 
include asset level abatement project costs that drive efficiencies and reduce emissions, expected costs for evolving carbon regulations based 
on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions and costs of offsets for any residual amounts. 
The total capital expenditure for abatement projects which includes energy efficiency improvements, the transformation of energy and chemicals 
parks, CCS facilities and electrification of our facilities included in the Operating Plan is in excess of $6 billion. Total yearly carbon emission costs 
in Shell's Operating Plan gradually increase from $1 billion in 2025 to $5 billion in 2034 using the mid-price scenario. The sensitivity of carrying 
value of assets to changes in carbon prices is described in the section below. 
Methods for estimating costs vary, depending on the nature of the cost. Abatement project costs to improve efficiencies and reduce emissions 
are estimated by applying a bottom-up approach where individual opportunities on an asset-level, project-by-project basis are identified. 
Costs for evolving carbon regulations are based on a forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions and are included in the Operating Plan at Shell's 
mid-price outlook on a country-by-country basis and represent management's best estimate. In the short and near term, up to around 2030, costs 
for carbon emissions estimates are largely policy driven, through emissions trading schemes or taxation levied by governments which currently 
vary significantly on a country-by-country basis. Beyond 2030, where policy predictions are more challenging, the costs for carbon emissions 
are estimated based on the expected costs of abatement technologies required for 2050. The estimated costs are trending towards $50 to 
$230 per tonne (RT24), depending on the country, in 2050.
Sensitivity to changes in carbon price assumptions
There is significant uncertainty as to how carbon costs will develop over the next decades. These will depend on policies set by countries and 
the pace of the energy transition. In accordance with IFRS, Shell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
that represent management's current best estimate, which is policy based up to 2030 and then based on the mid-price outlook beyond 2030. As 
the risk of stranded assets is prevalent with higher carbon emission prices than anticipated, sensitivity analyses have only been undertaken for such 
a downside scenario. If the IEA NZE50 outlook is applied, this would impact the recoverability of certain assets recognised in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024. This scenario is not representative of management's mid-price reasonable best estimate.
Sensitivity of carrying value to carbon emission costs as described below is under the assumption that all other factors in the value in use models 
used to calculate recoverability of carrying value remain unchanged. Changes to carbon emission costs are applied for Integrated Gas, Upstream 
and Chemicals and Products because of the potential impact on Shell's business.

Applying the IEA NZE50 carbon price scenario to Integrated Gas assets of $74 billion (2023: $72 billion) and Upstream assets of $77 billion 
(2023: $84 billion), up to the end of life of these assets, shows recoverable amounts that are $1-2 billion (2023: $2-4 billion) lower for Integrated 
Gas and up to $1 billion lower for Upstream than the carrying value as at December 31, 2024. 
Applying the IEA NZE50 carbon price scenario to Chemicals and Products assets of $38 billion shows recoverable amounts that are $1-2 billion 
lower than the carrying value as at December 31, 2024. For Chemicals and Products, increased carbon cost could however potentially be 
recovered partially through increased product sale prices.

Carrying value of Chemicals and Products assets
$ billion as at December 31
[A] Following resegmentation in 2024 (see Note 7), prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact between Marketing and 
Chemicals & Products segments. 
Within Chemicals and Products, the assets potentially most sensitive to the energy transition are refineries. 
Portfolio composition and changes
Since 2016, Shell's Chemicals and Products portfolio has evolved, shifting from 15 refineries at the end of 2016 to eight (of which one is classified 
as held for sale) at the end of 2024. During that period, Shell assumed the sole ownership of two refineries through the dissolution of the Motiva 
joint venture, and disposed of, converted or closed nine refineries. Further, during 2024 Shell agreed to sell one refinery (classified as assets held 
for sale at the end of 2024, see Note 19). The carrying value of refineries decreased from $10 billion as at December 31, 2016, to less than 
$6 billion as at December 31, 2024. In line with Shell's strategy, it is progressing the repurposing of its energy and chemicals parks; these key 
focused assets allows Shell to underpin its hydrocarbon energy sales and the sales of lower carbon products. 
Estimated useful life
Refineries in the Chemicals and Products segment (carrying value as at December 31, 2024, $6 billion (2023: $6 billion)) may be impacted under 
a 2°C or less external climate scenario. 
For refineries in Chemicals and Products, depreciation of assets is on a straight-line basis over the life of the assets, starting at the date the asset 
becomes available for use, over a period of 20 years (see Note 2). Over the course of the energy transition, the current carrying value of refineries 
will be fully depreciated, offset by anticipated investments in assets that are expected to be resilient in the energy transition as described above. 
Based on current depreciation of the carrying value as at December 31, 2024, and assuming no further investment, all refineries would be fully 
depreciated between four and 11 years. 
In addition to refineries, further assets of $32 billion include $24 billion of assets in relation to Chemicals. This includes $14 billion for the 
Pennsylvania chemical plant, which started operations in November 2022 and being a more efficient plant, it is expected to be more resilient in 
the energy transition. Chemical products are not produced with the aim to combust and consequently do not generate GHG emissions. Under the 
IEA NZE50 scenario chemical production volumes are not expected to decrease towards 2050, compared with current levels and hence chemical 
assets are expected to be resilient through the energy transition.
Other assets of $8 billion include $5 billion of assets mainly related to storage tanks, vessels, pipelines in trading and supply that are also 
expected to be resilient in the energy transition.
Price sensitivities
Where available Shell uses external climate scenarios for sensitivity testing. In relation to chemical and refining margin forecasts, no credible 
climate scenarios have been identified and consequently sensitivity testing is performed by providing sensitivity to changes in margins. 
Chemical margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $197.5/tonne (20-year average). A change 
of -$30/tonne or +$30/tonne in long-term chemical margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in up to 
$0.5 billion (2023: up to $2 billion) impairment or no impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products (see Note 13).
Refining margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $10/bbl (20-year). A change of -$1/bbl or +$1/
bbl to the refining margin outlook over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in no impairment (2023: $1-2 billion) or 
up to $0.5 billion (2023: up to $1 billion) impairment reversal respectively in Chemicals and Products (see Note 13).
Sensitivities to carbon prices are described in the section above.

Carrying value of Marketing assets
Carrying value of Marketing assets
$ billion as at December 31
[A] Following resegmentation in 2024 (see Note 7), prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact between Marketing and 
Chemicals & Products segments. 
Portfolio composition and changes
Assets in the Marketing segment are expected to be resilient through the energy transition with a change in the product mix as the energy 
transition progresses. The demand for products sold — such as chemicals, lubricants, biofuels, bitumen, electric vehicle charging and convenience 
retail -- is not expected to decrease and is expected to increase for a variety of these products in many markets. Shell is expanding networks of 
refuelling stations offering low-carbon fuels, including biofuels and various gaseous fuels, such as LNG and bio-LNG. As a result, the carrying 
value of these assets is not expected to be impacted by the energy transition or lower commodity price scenarios.
Carrying value of Renewables and Energy Solutions assets
Carrying value of Renewables and Energy Solutions assets
$ billion as at December 31
Portfolio composition and changes
In 2024 Shell refreshed its renewable generation, energy marketing, and gas and power trading strategy, shifting Shell's asset portfolio towards 
energy storage and flexible generation with an increased focus on power trading and minimising new investments in offshore wind projects. 
The aim is to maximise returns from onshore positions using capital-light business models, debt finance and partnerships. The carrying value 
of assets in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment in the balance sheet at December 31, 2024, is expected to be resilient through 
the energy transition.

Other energy transition considerations
Discount rate sensitivity 
The discount rate applied for value in use impairment testing is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and is 
determined at 7.5% except for the power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment where 6% is applied. The discount rate 
includes generic systematic risk for energy transition risk. In addition, cash flow projections applied in individual assets include specific asset risks, 
including risk of transition. An increase in systematic energy transition risk could lead to a higher WACC and consequently to a higher discount 
rate to be applied in impairment testing. An increase of the discount rate applied for impairment testing of 1% under the assumption that all other 
factors (such as commodity prices, product margins and carbon prices) in the models used to calculate recoverability of carrying value remain 
unchanged would lead to a change in the carrying value of $1-3 billion (2023: $2-4 billion) in Integrated Gas and Upstream, and no significant 
impairment in other segments (2023: up to $1 billion in Chemicals and Products). 
Global oil and gas demand considerations 
A decrease in global demand and unchanged supply of oil and gas would probably lead to a decrease in price (see price sensitivity above). 
During 2024, Shell's production of oil and gas accounted for some 1.5% and 2% of total global production of oil and gas respectively. Changes 
in global oil and gas demand are therefore not expected to directly impact the ability to sell volumes of oil and gas produced by Shell at 
market prices. 
Deferred tax assets
In general, it is expected that sufficient deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable profits within the planning period of 10 years are available 
for recovery of the deferred tax assets recognised at December 31, 2024. Integrated Gas and Upstream deferred tax assets recognised are 
expected to be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of $625 million as at December 31, 2024 (2023: 
$241 million) this period extends beyond 10 years. Deferred tax assets in Chemicals and Products and in Marketing expected to be recovered 
in more than 10 years (between 11 and 20 years) are $315 million as at December 31, 2024 (2023: $455 million) for which the forecasted 
taxable profits to determine recoverability have been risked. (See Note 23). 
Decommissioning and other provisions
The energy transition may result in decommissioning and restoration occurring earlier than expected. The risk on the timing of decommissioning 
and restoration activities for Integrated Gas and Upstream fields is limited, supported by production plans in the foreseeable future (see 
"Estimated useful life" above). Acceleration of decommissioning and restoration activities has also been reflected in the assessment of the 
appropriate discount rate.On an undiscounted basis the provision for decommissioning and restoration as at December 31, 2024 was 
$32 billion (2023: $33 billion), recognised on a discounted basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2024 at $18 billion 
(2023: $19 billion). Sensitivity to changes in the discount rate is provided in Note 25.
Historically, in Chemicals and Products, it was industry practice not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with 
manufacturing facilities. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefinite lives, so it was considered remote that an 
outflow of economic benefits would be required. In 2020, Shell considered the changed macroeconomic fundamentals, together with Shell's plans 
to rationalise the Group's manufacturing portfolio. Shell also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not to recognise decommissioning and 
restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities. Since 2020, decommissioning and restoration provisions are recognised for certain shorter-lived 
manufacturing facilities (see Notes 25 and 32). The energy and chemicals parks are considered longer-lived facilities that are expected to be 
resilient in the energy transition, and decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away.
Onerous contracts
Closure or early termination of activities may lead to supply contracts becoming onerous. Onerous contract provisions (see Note 25) have been 
recognised as at December 31, 2024, to reflect changes in expected future utilisation of certain assets. These include contracts in relation to 
unused terminals and refineries. The total carrying value of the provision for onerous contracts as at December 31, 2024 was $1.1 billion 
(2023: $1.1 billion) principally related to contracts in relation to unused terminals and refineries.
Dividend resilience
External stakeholders have requested disclosures on how climate change affects dividend-paying capacity. If a further impairment had been 
recognised in 2024 using any of the climate change scenarios described above, this would not have impacted the ability to pay dividends in 
this financial year because of strong cash flow generation and financial reserves. Had Shell applied the IEA NZE50 scenario (see above), and if 
this had led to a decrease in the recoverable amount of Integrated Gas and Upstream assets of $26-34 billion and recognition of an equivalent 
impairment, this would not have impacted the distributable reserves available to Shell from which to pay dividends in 2024. This is on the basis 
that such impairment would have resulted in part-realisation of the merger reserve recognised by the Company of $234 billion
as at December 31, 2024.
A forward-looking statement regarding future dividend-paying capacity cannot be provided because of unknown risks and uncertainties 
that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.

Physical risks
The potential impact of physical risks comes from both acute and chronic climate hazards. Acute hazards, such as flooding and droughts, wildfires 
and more severe tropical storms, and chronic hazards, such as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, could impact some of Shell's facilities, 
operations and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards and impacts is expected to increase in certain locations. Extreme weather events, 
whether or not related to climate change, could have a negative impact on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Mitigation of 
physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, is considered and embedded in the design and construction of Shell's projects, and/or 
operation of its assets to minimise the risk of adverse incidents to Shell's employees and contractors, the communities where Shell operates, and 
Shell's equipment. 
In 2023, Shell carried out a detailed review to assess the impact of a range of changing climatic conditions, including projected changes in 
temperature, precipitation, wind and sea levels, across segments and geographies for Shell's significant assets. Shell used IPCC climate modelling 
data covering three exploratory climate scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) across the time-horizons 2025, 2030 and 2050. These 
scenarios were selected to ensure a broad range of risks and uncertainties were assessed. There have been no changes to the climate modelling 
data that would require a full update of the 2023 assessment. Shell has confirmed there are no changes to the risk profile of Shell's significant 
assets and accounted for portfolio changes. In the short to medium term, the risks identified were found to be related to factors that Shell is 
already aware of (whether or not related to climate change) and that the assets are actively managing to mitigate, e.g. hurricane impacts in the 
US Gulf Coast, rising air temperatures in the Middle East and water scarcity in Europe and Asia. As an example, in recent years the Rhine river in 
Europe has seen historic lows during the summer months leading to challenges in the use of barges for transportation of Shell's products. Dredging 
of harbours and investment in shallower-draft barges have helped to mitigate the risk. In the long term, the results of the exercise indicated that 
while have evaluated against current climate modelling projections and Shell's current asset portfolio, by 2050 the frequency and severity of the 
climate hazards may differ from current projections. The level of predictability is such that the need for investment in climate adaptation measures 
at the assets is not immediate and the results mean Shell is in a position to monitor the assets and determine whether there is any need for 
adaptation action, e.g. the impact of potential water scarcity on various assets. Shell's testing to assess the potential impact of climate-related 
changes on its significant assets covers over 70% of the carrying value of Shell's physical assets as at December 31, 2023. Over 12% (based on 
the carrying value) of physical assets tested are considered to be exposed to climate-related physical risks in the short to medium term which the 
assets are already actively managing to mitigate. In addition, Shell reviewed significant acquisitions made in 2023 and 2024, none of which were 
found to have significant climate-related physical risks in the short to medium term. Shell's plan reflects the impact of mitigating actions in the short 
to medium term for the assets assessed. Shell will continue to monitor and assess the future exposure of Shell's assets in the longer term to 
changing climatic conditions to establish the need for any further adaptation actions and related metrics.
The impact of physical climate change on Shell's operations is unlikely to be limited to the boundaries of Shell's assets. For example, the 
downstream transportation and distribution of Shell's products from its own operations could potentially be exposed to climate-related hazards 
that ultimately impact Shell's operations. The overall impact, including how supply chains, resource availability and markets may be affected, also 
needs to be considered for a holistic assessment of this risk. Shell's assets manage this risk as part of broad risk and threat management processes 
as required by Shell's Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) standards, part of the wider Shell Performance Framework.

5. Emission schemes and related environmental programmes
Emission trading and related schemes
In general, emission trading schemes (ETS) are mandated governmental schemes to control emission levels and enhance clean energy transition, 
allowing for the trading of emission certificates. In most ETS, governments set an emission cap for one or more sectors. Generally, entities in scope 
of the scheme are allowed to buy emission certificates to cover shortages or sell surplus emission certificates. In certain countries, emissions are 
priced through a carbon tax. For Shell, the most significant carbon pricing mechanisms are established in Europe, Canada and Singapore.
Biofuel programmes
Biofuel programmes are mandated governmental schemes that set binding national targets on the share of renewables in fuel consumption 
or measures on reducing GHG emissions by fuel suppliers. Biofuels are blended with existing fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, to reduce net 
emissions. The share of biofuels in the total sales mix of fuel is used to comply with regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by the blending 
of biofuels in refineries and/or distribution depots (self-blending), through import of biofuels (for jurisdictions that grant biofuels certificates at the 
point of import) or by the purchasing of certificates from third parties (for jurisdictions that have a tradable biofuel certificates mechanism). Biofuel 
programmes also include regulatory requirements to pay a levy for the combustion of fossil fuels, based on CO₂ emitted – mainly related to the 
German Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) which has applied since January 1, 2021. 
Renewable power programmes
Renewable power programmes create a financial incentive to consume power that is sourced from renewable origins or require that a minimum 
percentage of power sold meets the green definition of the relevant standard. These regulations are typically accompanied by schemes supporting 
investments in the renewable technology. Renewable power programmes generally use certificates to monitor compliance, where renewable 
power certificates are granted for each MWh of energy generated that meets the predefined renewable criteria. Shell's compliance obligation 
under renewable power programmes comes primarily from energy supply and results from regulations applying in Europe, North America 
and Australia.

Environmental certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are recognised at cost under other intangible assets (see Note 11). 
In addition, a portfolio of environmental certificates is held for trading purposes and classified under inventory (see Note 2 and Note 17). 
Environmental certificates held for trading purposes can be redesignated for compliance purposes and then used to settle compliance obligations.
Cost recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents the compliance cost associated with emissions or with products sold during 
the year. The liability at year-end represents the compliance cost recognised over current and past compliance periods to the extent not settled

7. Segment information
General information 
Shell is an international energy company engaged in the principal aspects of the energy and petrochemical industries and reports its business 
through segments: Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, Renewables and Energy Solutions, and Corporate.
With effect from January 1, 2024, Wholesale Commercial Fuels forms part of Mobility with inclusion in the Marketing segment (previously 
Chemicals and Products segment). The change in segmentation reflects the increasing alignment between the economic characteristics of 
wholesale commercial fuels and other Mobility businesses, and is consistent with changes in the information provided to the Chief Executive 
Officer, who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker. Prior period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year 
presentation with an offsetting impact between the Marketing and the Chemicals and Products segments. Also, from January 1, 2024, Shell's 
longer-term innovation portfolio is managed centrally and hence reported as part of the Corporate segment (previously all other segments). Prior 
period comparatives have been revised to conform with current year presentation with an offsetting impact on all the other segments. 
The Integrated Gas segment includes liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products. 
It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to 
deliver these to market. The segment also includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of LNG.
The Upstream segment includes exploration and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil 
and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to the market.
The Marketing segment comprises the Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors & Decarbonisation businesses. The Mobility business operates Shell's 
retail network, including electric vehicle charging services and the wholesale commercial fuels business which provides fuels for transport, industry 
and heating. The Lubricants business produces, markets and sells lubricants for road transport and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, 
power generation, agriculture and construction. The Sectors & Decarbonisation business sells fuels, speciality products and services, including
low-carbon energy solutions, to a broad range of commercial customers, including the aviation, marine and agricultural sectors.
The Chemicals and Products segment includes chemical manufacturing plants, with their own marketing network, and refineries, which turn crude 
oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products which are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. 
The segment also includes the pipeline business, trading and optimisation of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and oil sands activities 
(the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into synthetic crude oil).

7. Segment information continued
The Renewables and Energy Solutions segment includes activities such as renewable power generation, the marketing and trading and 
optimisation of power and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits and digitally enabled customer solutions. The segment also includes production 
and marketing of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon capture and storage hubs, investment in nature-based projects that avoid or 
reduce carbon emissions, and Shell Ventures, which invests in companies that work to accelerate the energy and mobility transformation.
The Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting Shell. The segment comprises Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, 
its self-insurance activities, headquarters and central functions, and centrally managed longer-term innovation portfolio. All finance expense 
and income and related taxes are included in Corporate segment earnings rather than in the earnings of business segments.
Basis of segmental reporting
Sales between segments are based on prices generally equivalent to commercially available prices. Third-party revenue and non-current assets 
information by geographical area are based on the country of operation of the Group subsidiaries that report this information. Separate disclosure 
is provided for the UK as this is the Company's country of domicile. 
Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which was the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive 
Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes 
sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings 
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. 
Finance expense and income related to core financing activities, as well as related taxes, are included in the Corporate segment earnings rather 
than in the earnings of the business segments.
Information by segment on a current cost of supplies basis is as follows:

Discount rate and other assumptions
The discount rates applied in determining value in use reflect a current market assessment of the time value of money, adjusted for risks not 
included in forecast cash flows. The discount rate applied is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC), derived 
from the following key assumptions:
WACC assumptions
Risk-free rate
Derived from a range of benchmark 
US Treasury yields of varying 
maturities, to reflect the range of 
useful economic lives of Shell's assets 
and to appropriately adjust, where 
relevant, for pricing anomalies and 
short-term volatility of specific tenors.
Cost of debt [A]
Derived from observable risk 
premiums on corporate debt issued 
by a group of comparable energy 
companies, adjusted for a blended 
statutory tax rate.
Cost of equity [A]
Calculated per the capital asset 
pricing model. Equity risk premiums 
are derived from a range of 
published sources, adjusted to reflect 
a beta derived from a peer group of 
comparable energy companies, and 
subsequently calibrated to ensure 
that total cost of equity is consistent 
with market practice.
[A] The peer group of comparable energy companies is tailored to reflect relevant integrated power companies (for power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment) and 
integrated oil and gas companies (for the rate applied to all other assets). The proportion of debt and equity in the WACC calculation reflects a target gearing ratio, tailored for power 
activities and oil and gas activities as appropriate.
This rate is reassessed throughout the reporting period, with adjustments made when changes in assumptions applied would lead to a change 
in an investor's expected rate of return on a portfolio of similar assets. This assessment considers a range of factors, including macroeconomic 
forecasts, the historical volatility of key assumptions and the level of risking reflected in cash flow forecasts, including the extent to which systemic 
risks have been reflected in Shell's Operating Plan, which forms the basis of forecast cash flows in determining value in use. 
Cash flow projections used in the determination of value in use were made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply 
and demand, forecast expenditures, potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions, product margins including forecast refining 
margins, chemical margins and expected production volumes (see Note 2). The level of risking reflected in these assumptions is a consideration 
in management's assessment of the discount rate to be applied in order to avoid duplication of systemic and asset-specific risking in calculating 
value in use, and to ensure the discount rate applied is commensurate with risks included in forecast cash flows.
The discount rate applied was a nominal post-tax WACC of 6% (2023: 6%) for the power activities in the Renewables and Energy Solutions 
segment and a nominal post-tax WACC of 7.5% (2023: 7.5%) for all other businesses. Management assessed the appropriateness of these 
discount rates as a result of rising bond yields towards the end of 2024. Management concluded that the discount rates remain appropriate 
and materially commensurate with other significant cash flow assumptions.

13. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets continued
Recoverable value was predominantly assessed by reference to value in use in segments other than the Renewables and Energy Solutions 
segment. The pre-tax discount rates applied for value in use impairment testing vary according to the characteristics of the asset, including 
its useful life and cash flow profiles. The weighted average pre-tax discount rate applied in the recognition of impairment charges during the 
year was 9.0% for segments other than the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment.
The near-term commodity price assumptions applied in impairment testing were as follows:
Commodity price assumptions [A]
2024 2025 2026 2027 2028
Brent crude oil ($/b)  70  70  70  74 
Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu)  3.30  4.00  4.00  4.24 
2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
Brent crude oil ($/b)  70  70  70  74 
Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu)  4.00  4.00  4.00  4.00 
[A] Money of the day.
For periods after 2028, the real-term price assumptions applied were: $70 per barrel (/b) (2023: $70/b) for Brent crude oil, and a linear increase 
from $4.05 per million British thermal units (/MMBtu) to $5.00/MMBtu in 2048 (2023: $4.00/MMBtu) for Henry Hub natural gas. 
Oil and gas price assumptions applied for impairment testing are reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted on a periodic basis. Reviews include 
comparison with available market data and forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, 
policy measures and, in supply, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply, and behaviour of major 
resource holders. 
For certain assets in the Chemicals and Products and Renewables and Energy Solutions segments, the recoverable value was determined by 
reference to fair value less costs of disposal. In determining fair value, adjustments are made to forecast cash flows to reflect assumptions used 
by market participants. These adjustments predominantly relate to the discount rate applied and commodity price assumptions. For certain assets 
in the Renewables and Energy Solutions segment, the valuation methodology incorporates other adjustments to reflect comparable transactions. 
The total carrying value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2024, for which recoverable 
value was tested in 2024 by reference to fair value less costs of disposal was $0.9 billion related to assets in Renewables and Energy Solutions 
and $1 billion in Marketing. The majority of the assets for which the recoverable value was determined by reference to fair value less costs of 
disposal are related to assets classified as held for sale (see Note 19). 
The total carrying value of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2023, for which recoverable 
value was tested in 2023 by reference to fair value less costs of disposal was $2.6 billion related to assets in Renewables and Energy Solutions 
and $2.5 billion in Chemicals and Products. The weighted average post-tax discount rate applied to impairments recognised during 2023 is 12% 
for Renewables and Energy Solutions and 10% for Chemicals and Products.
Goodwill
Goodwill impairments of $510 million in 2024 are mainly recognised in Renewables and Energy Solutions, triggered by a portfolio choice 
regarding renewable generation assets in North America.
Goodwill impairments of $635 million in 2023 were mainly recognised in Renewables and Energy Solutions primarily related to an asset in 
North America, triggered by annual goodwill impairment testing reflecting factors including the impact of the deteriorated macro environment. 
Property, plant and equipment
Exploration and production
Impairment losses recognised in Exploration and production in 2024 of $783 million related to various assets in Integrated Gas ($543 million) 
and Upstream ($240 million). Impairments recognised in Integrated Gas mainly related to an asset located in Australia, triggered by factors 
including revised price, production and cost estimates. Impairment losses recognised in Upstream principally relate to projects in North America 
and Europe, triggered by portfolio choices.
Impairment losses recognised in Exploration and production in 2023 of $4,820 million related to various assets in Integrated Gas ($3,472 
million) and Upstream ($1,348 million). Impairments recognised in Integrated Gas mainly related to an asset located in North America, triggered 
by a change in the discount rate applied, and a project in Australia, triggered by factors including revised production estimates and regulatory 
changes. Impairment losses recognised in Upstream principally relate to projects in North America, Nigeria and the UK triggered by factors 
including revised reserves estimates and portfolio choices.
Manufacturing, supply and distribution
Impairment losses recognised in Manufacturing, supply and distribution in 2024 of $1,278 million mainly related to an energy and chemicals park 
located in Singapore, due to remeasurement of the fair value less costs of disposal triggered by a sales agreement reached, and to various smaller 
assets in Chemicals and Products.

13. Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets continued
Impairment losses recognised in Manufacturing, supply and distribution in 2023 of $2,785 million mainly related to chemical assets in Singapore 
in Chemicals and Products, triggered by lower expected chemical margins and associated with portfolio choices.
Other
Other impairment losses in 2024 of $1,612 million mainly related to the impairments in Marketing ($1,518 million), assets in Renewables and 
Energy Solutions ($52 million) and various smaller assets in Integrated Gas, Upstream and Chemicals and Products. The impairment in Marketing 
principally relates to a biofuels facility located in the Netherlands, triggered by a temporary pause of on-site construction work.
Other impairment losses in 2023 of $577 million related to various assets in Marketing ($292 million) and assets in Renewables and Energy 
Solutions mainly in Europe ($273 million).
Impairment reversals in 2024 of $333 million are mainly triggered by the reassessment of value in use in Renewables and Energy Solutions 
($134 million) and divestments in Chemicals and Products ($114 million).
Impairment reversals in 2023 of $627 million were mainly triggered by the reassessment of fair value less costs of disposal in Integrated Gas
($325 million) and revised reserves estimates in Upstream ($203 million).
Impairment losses in 2022 mainly related to the withdrawal from Russia ($854 million), the classification of an Upstream asset as held for sale 
($320 million) and an impairment of capital expenditure additions in fully impaired sites in Chemicals and Products ($257 million). 
The recognition of impairment reversals in 2022 was mainly triggered by the revision of Shell's mid- and long-term commodity price assumptions 
reflecting the energy market demand and supply fundamentals. They are related to: i) Integrated Gas for $3,449 million, mainly relating to the 
Queensland Curtis LNG asset; and ii) Upstream for $2,504 million, mainly related to two offshore projects in Brazil and an asset in the Gulf 
of America.
Sensitivities
The main sensitivities in relation to value in use impairment assessment are the commodity price assumptions in Integrated Gas and Upstream, 
refining and chemical margins in Chemicals and Products, and discount rates in all segments.
Commodity price assumptions
A change of -10% or +10% in the commodity price assumptions over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in 
$5-9 billion in impairments or $2-5 billion in impairment reversal, respectively, in Integrated Gas and Upstream. 
Refining margins
Refining margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $10/bbl. A change of -$1/bbl or +$1/bbl
in long-term refining margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in no impairments or up to $0.5 billion in 
impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products. 
Chemical margins
Chemical margins applied for impairment testing by reference to value in use are at an average of $197.5/tonne. A change of -$30/tonne or +
$30/tonne in long-term chemical margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in up to $0.5 billion in 
impairments or no impairment reversal, respectively, in Chemicals and Products. 
Discount rates
A change of +1% in the discount rate would ceteris paribus result in $1-3 billion in impairments in Integrated Gas and Upstream, and would have 
no significant impact in other segments. 
Where applicable, the above sensitivities include impairment charges that would arise in respect of associates and joint ventures. Where 
carrying values have been supported by reference to fair value less costs of disposal, recoverable amounts are less sensitive to Shell's planning 
assumptions. This is on the basis that key assumptions (including discount rates and commodity prices) have been adjusted to reflect those used 
by market participants. 
In calculating recoverable value, key assumptions are not determined in isolation, to ensure relevant interdependencies are appropriately 
reflected. In particular, management considers the relationship between discount rates, forecast commodity prices and cash flow risking to ensure 
impairment testing assumptions result in an implicit expected return which is balanced and appropriate for the asset under review. Each of the 
sensitivities described above has been tested under a ceteris paribus assumption where all other factors remain unchanged, and as such does 
not reflect the potential offsetting effects of corresponding changes in other assumptions.

Other receivables at December 31, 2024, included current indirect tax receivables of $1.5 billion (2023: $1.5 billion), government subsidies of 
$795 million (2023:$484 million), non-current income tax receivables of $680 million (2023: $568 million) and current income tax receivables 
of $391 million (2023: $558 million).
Provisions for impairments deducted from trade and other receivables amounted to $1,253 million at December 31, 2024 (2023: $1,251 million).
Allowance for expected credit losses -- trade receivables
Shell uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables. The provision matrix is initially based on Shell's 
historical observed default rates. Shell calculates the ECL to adjust the historical credit loss experienced with forward-looking information.
The ECL at December 31, 2024, was $113 million (2023: $185 million), which represents 0.36-0.51% (2023: 0.51-0.54%) of all trade receivables. 
A loss allowance provision of $414 million (2023: $415 million) was established in addition to all other impairments to trade receivables
as at December 31, 2024, that are outside of the provision matrix calculations. 
Lease receivables
Lease contracts where Shell is the lessor are classified as finance leases or operating leases. Receivables for lease contracts classified as finance

21. Debt continued
During 2024, Shell had access to international debt capital markets via two commercial paper (CP) programmes, a US universal shelf (US shelf) 
registration and a Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme. Issuances under the CP programmes are supported by a committed credit facility 
and cash. 
Under the CP programmes, Shell can issue debt of up to $10,000 million with maximum maturities ranging between 183 days and 364 days 
depending on the form of the notes issued; and $10,000 million with maturities not exceeding 397 days.
The US shelf registration provides Shell with the flexibility to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants. 
The registration is updated once every three years and was last updated in December 2023. During 2024, no debt was issued under this 
registration (2023: no debt issued).
The EMTN programme lapsed in November 2024 and will be renewed during 2025. During 2024, no debt was issued under this programme
(2023: no debt issued).
On December 13, 2019, Shell refinanced its revolving credit facility (RCF), which is linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR),
at pre-agreed margins. Shell elected not to extend the short-dated tranche of $1,920 million in 2024. The remaining $8,000 million expires 
in 2026 (2023: $8,000 million expiring in 2026). The terms and availability are not conditional on Shell's financial ratios nor its credit ratings. 
The interest and fees related to these facilities are linked to Shell's progress towards reaching its short-term Net Carbon Intensity target.
The following tables compare contractual cash flows for debt, excluding lease liabilities at December 31, with the carrying amount in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contractual amounts reflect the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates; differences from carrying amounts 
reflect the effects of discounting, premiums and, where fair value hedge accounting is applied, fair value adjustments. Interest is estimated 
assuming that interest rates applicable to variable-rate debt remain constant and there is no change in aggregate principal amounts of debt 
other than repayment at scheduled maturity, as reflected in the table.

Interest rate swaps have been entered into against certain fixed rate debt affecting the effective interest rate on these balances (see Note 26).
The fair value of debt excluding lease liabilities at December 31, 2024, was $44,119 million (2023: $50,866 million), mainly determined from
the prices quoted for those securities. The difference between the fair value of debt and the carrying amount is predominantly related to the 
difference between the fixed rate and the current market rate.

[A] Future cash outflows in respect of leases may differ from lease liabilities recognised due to future decisions that may be taken by Shell in respect of the use of leased assets. These decisions 
may result in variable lease payments being made. In addition, Shell may reconsider whether it will exercise extension options or termination options, which are not reflected in the lease 
liabilities. There is no exposure to these potential additional payments in excess of the recognised lease liabilities until these decisions have been taken by Shell.

Adjustments in respect of prior periods relate to events in the current period and reflect the effects of changes in rules, facts or other factors 
compared with those used in establishing the current tax position or deferred tax balance in prior periods.
In 2022, adjustments in respect of changes in tax rates and legislation of $524 million principally relate to the introduction of the UK Energy 
Profits Levy Act 2022 (EPL).

On June 20, 2023, the UK substantively enacted Pillar Two Model Rules, effective as from January 1, 2024. The Pillar Two rules are designed to 
ensure large multinational enterprises (meeting certain conditions) pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they 
operate. Shell has applied the exception, as set out in the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, to recognising and disclosing information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

23. Taxation continued
Other movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities are mainly related to assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly associated with 
assets classified as held for sale (see note 19).
The deferred tax category Other primarily includes deferred tax positions in respect of leases, financial assets and liabilities, inventories, intangible 
assets other than goodwill and investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
The deferred tax category property, plant and equipment also includes deferred tax positions in respect of investments in partnerships in the USA 
which are considered pass-through entities by its parent for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets of $6,857 million (2023: $6,454 million) are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will 
be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to be recovered, and a judgement as to whether or not there will 
be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets. It is considered probable based on business forecasts that such taxable profits will be 
available. For Marketing, as well as Chemicals and Products, additional judgement is required; in some jurisdictions the assessment of forecasted 
taxable profits resulting in deferred tax asset recognition of $315 million (2023: $455 million) extends for an additional 10 years beyond Shell's 
regular 10-year planning horizon. In those situations, additional risking has been applied to the forecast of taxable profits. For Integrated Gas and 
Upstream, deferred tax assets recognised are expected to be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of 
$625 million (2023: $241 million) as at December 31, 2024, this period extends beyond 10 years. 
The amount of deferred tax assets which are dependent on future taxable profits not arising from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, 
and which relate to tax jurisdictions where Shell has suffered a loss in the current or preceding year, was $4,022 million at December 31, 2024 
(2023: $2,027 million). The increase compared with 2023 is primarily attributable to a higher number of entities which have generated losses 
in 2024.

fiscal year, June 30, 2024 (June 30, 2023: $46,220 million).
Unrecognised taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed retained earnings of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates amounted to $4,504 million at December 31, 2024 (2023: $5,311 million). These retained earnings are subject to withholding tax 
upon distribution.
Excluding unrecognised tax losses for PRRT, the unrecognised deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward 
amounted to $27,568 million at December 31, 2024 (2023: $28,460 million), and included amounts of $25,875 million (2023: $25,489 million) 
that are subject to time limits for utilisation of five years or later, or are not time limited. 
24. Retirement benefits 
Retirement benefits are provided in most of the countries where Shell has operational activities. Shell offers these benefits through funded 
and unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The most significant pension plans are in the Netherlands, UK and USA. 
Other post-employment benefits (OPEB) comprising retirement health care and life insurance are also provided in certain countries. The most 
significant OPEB plan is in the USA.

Employer contributions to funded defined benefit pension plans are based on actuarial valuations in accordance with local regulations and are 
estimated to be $862 million in 2025.
Characteristics of significant defined benefit and defined contribution plans and regulatory framework
The Netherlands
The principal defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands is a funded career-averaged pension arrangement with retired employees drawing 
benefits as an annuity, with a surplus of $4,753 million reported as at December 31, 2024, (2023: $3,520 million surplus). While the plan was 
closed to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 2013, it currently remains open for ongoing accrual for existing active members. Active members 
account for 21% (2023: 23%) of the total defined benefit liability in the Netherlands. From July 1, 2013 onwards, new employees in the 
Netherlands are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan. 
In line with Dutch regulations, the defined benefit pension plan has a joint Trustee Board with trustee representatives nominated by the Company, 
the Central Staff Council and retired members. The defined benefit pension plan also has an Accountability Council comprising members 
nominated by the Company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. Furthermore, there is a Supervisory Committee, which includes 
external experts from the pension industry, to oversee management, compliance and operations of the fund. The defined contribution pension 
plan has a one-tier Trustee Board with an independent chair, trustee representatives nominated by the Company and the Central Staff Council, 
as well as two executive board members. The defined contribution fund also has an Accountability Council comprised of members nominated 
by the Company and the Central Staff Council. Both Trustee Boards are responsible for administering the plans in line with the Dutch 
"Pensioenwet" (PW), including corporate governance, investment strategy for the pension plans' assets and paying member benefits,
and are required to act in the best interests of the members.
Dutch pension reform
As per July 1, 2023, new pension legislation ("Wet Toekomst Pensioenen" (WTP)) came into effect in the Netherlands, with implementation 
required prior to January 2028. This legislation aims to create a more resilient and adaptable pensions system that can better accommodate 
demographic changes and economic fluctuations while providing adequate retirement income. The legislation requires all future pension accruals 
to be in a defined contribution framework, with the intention that existing benefits accrued in pension funds are also converted into a defined 
contribution framework. The new regulatory framework will impact Shell's existing defined benefit pension plan, net pension scheme and defined 
contribution pension plan in the Netherlands. 
In response to the new pension legislation the Company, with the consent of the Central Staff Council in the Netherlands, decided on June 25, 
2024, that all future pension accruals from January 1, 2027, will be under a defined contribution framework. The new pension scheme(s) and 
associated transition measures were laid down in separate transition plans. In July 2024, these were formally submitted to the Trustee Boards 
of the pension funds for their acceptance. It is the intention that the gross defined benefit scheme of Shell will be transferred into a new defined 
contribution plan from January 1, 2027, and that the defined contribution plan of Shell will be transformed on January 1, 2026. 
The transition plan for the defined benefit plan states that the transfer into a new defined contribution plan is subject to the local funding level 
of the plan remaining above an agreed level (125%) during the predetermined transition period. If the Trustee Board of the defined benefit plan 
formally accepts the transition plan (expected in 2025), Shell will derecognise the pension surplus, based on asset ceiling principles, resulting in 
a loss in other comprehensive income and an additional "minimum funding requirement" for an expected final cash contribution. Subsequently, at 
the date of transition (December 31, 2026), a charge to the Consolidated Statement of Income is expected in respect of the surplus previously 
derecognised. The likelihood of acceptance of the plan, and the extent to which the funding level will meet the agreed 125% threshold, is subject 
to uncertainty. If the funding level of the defined benefit plan falls below 125% during the transition period, the transition plan and anticipated 
cash contributions may need to be reassessed.
The amounts to be recognised which will be determined at each respective date are subject to uncertainty and market risks and may have 
a material impact on Shell's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
UK
The four largest defined benefit pension plans for employees in the UK are funded final salary pension arrangements with retired employees 
mainly drawing benefits as an annuity with the option to take a portion as a lump sum. The three plans are separate and independent plans 
and cannot be netted against each other. In total, the plans reported a surplus of $2,603 million as at December 31, 2024 (2023: surplus of 
$3,246 million), which is after netting of unfunded plans of $319 million (2023: $340 million) which are reported as non-current liabilities on 
the balance sheet. All three plans were closed to new employees hired or rehired. However, two plans currently remain open for ongoing accrual 
for existing active members. Active members account for 14% (2023: 16%) of the total defined benefit liability in the UK. From March 1, 2013, 
onwards new employees in the UK are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.
In line with UK regulations, the principal defined benefit pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board comprises four trustee directors 
nominated by the Company, including the chair and four member-nominated trustee directors. The defined contribution pension plan is governed by a 
corporate trustee whose board comprises of three company-nominated directors, including the chair and two member-nominated trustee directors. 
The trustees are responsible for administering the plans in line with the Trust Deed and Regulations, including setting the investment strategy for the 
pension plans' assets and paying member benefits, and are required to act in the best interests of the members of the pension plans.
For the funded defined benefit pension plan for former BG employees, the BG Pension Scheme (BGPS), the Board of Trustees of the BG Pension 
Scheme decided to enter into a qualifying insurance contract for the full scheme (buy in) with a third-party insurer which was executed on 
September 11, 2024. This policy replaces the previous investments held to support the BGPS's benefits, and as a consequence, the longevity 
and investment risks have been transferred in full to the insurer. The liabilities relating to the scheme remain on the balance sheet but are now 
fully insured. The scheme has defined benefit liabilities of $1,270 million and a surplus of $105 million reported at December 31, 2024.

USA
The principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA is a funded final average pay pension plan with a surplus of $638 million reported as at 
December 31, 2024 (2023: $140 million surplus). After retirement, all retirees can choose to draw their benefits as an annuity, whereas others 
also have the choice to take their benefit in a lump sum. There is also an unfunded defined benefit pension plan with a deficit of $809 million 
(2023: $884 million deficit). The benefits under this plan are taken primarily in a lump sum. In addition, the Company provides a defined 
contribution benefit plan. The funded defined benefit, unfunded defined benefit, and Shell's defined contribution pension plans are subject 
to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). 
In line with Shell Group's strategic objectives and risk management, on January 30, 2024, the principal defined benefit pension plan in the 
USA, Shell Pension Plan, entered into a contract with a third-party insurance company to settle $5,052 million of pension liabilities. The settlement 
price consisted of $4,920 million of pension assets. As a result of this transaction, all legal and constructive obligations for a tranche of benefits 
provided by the Shell Pension Plan have been eliminated. A gain on settlement of $101 million (after associated adjustment for deferred tax) has 
been recognised in Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income. As a consequence, as of December 31, 2024, the total active members increased 
to 30% (2023: 23%) of the total defined benefit liability in the USA.
Both the funded defined benefit pension plan and the defined contribution pension plan are governed by trustees who are appointed by the Plan 
Sponsor and are named fiduciaries with respect to the plans. The trustees are generally responsible for investment-related matters, appointing 
the Plan Administrator, maintaining general oversight and deciding appeals of participants.
USA OPEB 
The Company also sponsors other post-retirement employee benefits (OPEB), mainly in the USA. The OPEB plans in the USA provide medical, 
dental and vision benefits, as well as life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the Company and retirees 
share the costs of the premiums with a deficit of $2,337 million reported as at December 31, 2024 (2023: $2,267 million deficit). The plan that 
provides post-retirement medical benefits in the USA is closed to employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Certain life insurance 
benefits are paid by the Company.
Significant funding requirements: 
￮ Additional contributions to the Dutch defined benefit pension plan would be required if the 12-month rolling average local funding percentage 
falls below 105% for six months or more. At the most recent 2024 funding valuation, the local funding percentage was above this level. 
￮ There are no set minimum statutory funding requirements for the UK plans. A professional qualified independent actuary, appointed by the 
trustee board, undertakes a local funding valuation typically every three years. The most recent completed funding valuation for the principal 
defined benefit plan was undertaken as at December 31, 2023, and revealed a funding ratio of 108% and therefore no sponsor contributions 
(except for salary sacrifice contributions) were payable under the schedule of contributions. 
￮ Under the Pension Protection Act, US pension plans are subject to minimum required contribution levels based on the funding position.
No contributions are required based on the most recent funding valuation.
Associated risks to which retirement benefits are exposed
There are inherent risks associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB plans. These risks are related to various assumptions made on valuation 
of the liabilities and the cash funding requirement of the underlying plans. Volatility in capital markets or government policies, and the resulting 
consequences for investment performance, interest and inflation rates, as well as changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or 
pensionable remuneration at retirement, could result in significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. In case of a shortfall, 
there could be a requirement to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations).
These inherent risks are managed by a pension forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell's pension strategy, policy 
and operations. The forum is supported by a risk committee in reviewing the results of the assurance process with respect to pension risk.
Investment strategies
Long-term investment strategies of plans are generally determined by the relevant pension plan trustees using a structured asset/liability 
modelling approach to define the asset mix that best meets the objectives of optimising returns within agreed risk levels, while maintaining 
adequate funding levels.
Principal and actuarial assumptions
The principal assumptions applied in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations and their bases were as follows: 
￮rates of increase in pensionable remuneration, pensions in payment and health care costs: historical experience and management's
long-term expectation;
￮ discount rates: prevailing long-term AA corporate bond yields, chosen to match the currency and duration of the relevant obligation; and 
￮ mortality rates: published standard mortality tables for the individual countries concerned adjusted for Shell experience where statistically 
significant. 
The weighted averages for those assumptions and related sensitivity information as at December 31, 2024 are presented below. Sensitivity 
information indicates by how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease 
with no change in other assumptions. The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as 
it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation from one another. The weighted averages are at nominal terms and based on 
market expectations at December 31, 2024.

The amount and timing of settlement in respect of these provisions are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are not always within 
management's control. Reviews of estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs and the discount rate applied are carried out regularly. 
The discount rate applied at December 31, 2024, was 4.5% (2023: 4.5%). 
In 2024, there was a decrease of $3,105 million in provisions due to disposals and liabilities classified as held for sale. Of this total $3,053 million 
relate to liabilities classified as held for sale (see Note 19).
An increase of 0.5% or a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate could result in a decrease of $0.9 billion (2023: $0.9 billion) or an increase of 
$1.0 billion (2023: $1.0 billion) in decommissioning and restoration provisions, respectively. Where applicable, the associated increase in the 
carrying amount of the related asset would be tested for impairment. 
Other provisions at December 31, 2024, include amounts recognised in respect of employee benefits.

Risks
In the normal course of business, financial instruments of various kinds are used for the purposes of managing exposure to interest rate, foreign 
exchange and commodity price movements.
Treasury standards are applicable to all subsidiaries and each subsidiary is required to adopt a treasury policy consistent with these standards. 
These policies cover: financing structure; interest rate and foreign exchange risk management; insurance; counterparty risk management; and use 
of derivative contracts. Wherever possible, treasury operations are carried out through specialist regional organisations without removing from 
each subsidiary the responsibility to formulate and implement appropriate treasury policies.
Apart from forward foreign exchange contracts to meet known commitments, the use of derivative contracts by most subsidiaries is not permitted 
by their treasury policy.
Other than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative contracts is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that 
have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.
Shell's operations expose it to market, credit and liquidity risk, as described below.
Market risk
Market risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of assets, 
liabilities or expected future cash flows.
Interest rate risk
Most debt is raised from central borrowing programmes. Shell's policy is to have debt principally denominated in dollars and to retain a balanced 
exposure to fixed and floating rates over time. Shell has issued a significant amount of fixed rate debt in recent years, taking advantage of 
historically low interest rates. As a result, the majority of the debt portfolio at December 31, 2024, is fixed. 
The financing of most subsidiaries is structured on a floating-rate basis, and any further interest rate risk management is only applied under 
exceptional circumstances. 
On the basis of the floating-rate net cash position at December 31, 2024, (both issued and hedged), and assuming other factors (principally 
foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further interest rate management action was taken, an increase 
in interest rates of 1% would have increased 2024 income before taxation by $268 million (2023: $226 million increase).
The carrying amounts and maturities of debt and borrowing facilities are presented in Note 21. Interest expense is presented in Note 10.
Foreign exchange risk 
Many of the markets in which Shell operates are priced, directly or indirectly, in dollars. As a result, the functional currency of most Integrated Gas 
and Upstream entities and those with significant cross-border business is the dollar. For Chemicals and Products entities, the functional currency is 
typically the local currency. Consequently, Shell is exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk: when an entity enters into transactions that 
are not denominated in its functional currency; when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date; and 
as a result of holding net investments in operations that are not dollar-functional. Each entity is required to adopt treasury policies that are 
designed to measure and manage its foreign exchange exposures by reference to its functional currency.

299 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 302 ----
26. Financial instruments continued
Foreign exchange gains and losses arise in the normal course of business from the recognition of receivables and payables and other monetary 
items in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. Foreign exchange risk may also arise in connection with capital expenditure. For 
major projects, an assessment is made at the final investment decision stage of whether to hedge any resulting exposure. 
Assuming other factors (principally interest rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further foreign exchange risk management 
actions were taken, a 10% appreciation against the dollar at December 31 of the main currencies to which Shell is exposed would have had the 
following effects:

Australian dollar  (103)  (129)  625  780 
Canadian dollar  20  9  1,353  1,392 
The above sensitivity information was calculated by reference to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at December 31 only. The effect 
on income before taxation arises in connection with monetary balances denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency; 
the effect on net assets arises principally from the translation of assets and liabilities of entities that are not dollar-functional. 
Foreign exchange gains and losses included in income are presented in Note 9.
Commodity price risk 
Certain subsidiaries have a mandate to trade crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and environmental 
certificates, and to use commodity derivative contracts (forwards, futures, swaps and options) as a means of managing price and timing risks 
arising from this trading activity. In effecting these transactions, the entities concerned operate within procedures and policies designed to ensure 
that risks are managed within authorised limits. A department that is independent from Shell's traders monitors market risk exposures daily.
Value-at-risk (VAR) techniques based on variance/covariance or Monte Carlo simulation models are used to make a statistical assessment of the 
market risk arising from possible future changes in market values for commodity positions held by these subsidiaries over a 1-day holding period 
and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions, the history of price movements 
and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is 
maintained. The VAR average and year-end positions in respect of commodities traded in liquid markets, which are presented in the table 
below, are calculated on a diversified basis in order to reflect the effect of offsetting risk within combined portfolios.

Europe gas and power  13  13  31  12 
Australia gas and power  3  3  4  2 
Environmental certificates  5  2  9  4 
Furthermore, commodity derivative hedge contracts are used to partially mitigate price volatility on future LNG sales and purchases. 
As contracts to buy and sell physical LNG are accounted for on an accrual basis (see Note 2) and commodity derivatives are accounted for on a 
fair-value basis, this creates an accounting mismatch over periods. The fair value accounting of commodity derivatives can result in gains or losses 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income. These derivative contracts are based on a mix of European and North American gas price indices, 
global crude price indices and Asian LNG price indices. In previous years, Shell has seen high volatility in these markets. On that basis, a sensitivity 
analysis has been performed for a 50% price increase or decrease of this basket of derivative contracts at year-end 2024, which would result in a 
pre-tax loss or gain of $0.6 billion in the Consolidated Statement of Income (2023: $1.5 billion pre-tax gain or loss), whereas the same sensitivity 
analysis applied to the average exposures for the period was a gain or loss of $0.3 billion (2023: $0.8 billion pre-tax).

Credit risk 
Comprehensive policies are in place to ensure that credit risk is appropriately managed and remains within risk appetite. These policies include 
requirements for assessment of internal credit ratings, the assignment of credit limits based on counterparty creditworthiness, and monitoring of 
exposure against these credit limits. Credit information is regularly shared between business and finance functions, with dedicated teams in place 
to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration. Mitigation measures are defined and implemented for higher-risk business partners 
and customers, and include shortened payment terms, collateral, credit insurance, or other security posting and timely collections.
Surplus cash is invested in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, 
reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country 
or counterparty. Management monitors the investments regularly and adjusts the investment portfolio in light of new market information where 
necessary to ensure credit risk is effectively diversified.
In commodity trading, additional requirements are established to manage credit risk. Credit checks are performed by a department independent 
of traders, and are undertaken before contractual commitment. In addition, a defined portfolio credit risk appetite is in place to manage credit risk 
concentrations. It includes a set of thresholds and alerts set at different portfolio levels (e.g. country, industry sector, creditworthiness). Utilisation 
against these thresholds, including identification of credit risk concentrations with particular counterparties, is actively monitored, and actions are 
taken to ensure compliance where appropriate. There were no material concentrations of credit risk, with individual customers or geographically, 
at December 31, 2024.
Shell routinely enters into offsetting, master netting and similar arrangements with trading and other counterparties to manage credit risk. Where 
there is a legally enforceable right of offset under such arrangements and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously, the net asset or liability is recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, otherwise assets and liabilities are 
presented gross. These amounts, as presented net and gross within trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivative 
financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, were as follows:

The carrying amount of financial assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities at December 31, 2024, presented within trade 
and other receivables, was $2,519 million (2023: $3,437 million). The carrying amount of collateral held at December 31, 2024, presented within 
trade and other payables, was $581 million (2023: $1,404 million). In addition, Shell has utilised guarantees and letters of credit as non-cash 
collateral to cover margining requirements of $1,359 million as at December 31, 2024 (2023: $1,506 million). Collateral mainly relates to initial 
margins held with commodity exchanges/brokers and over-the-counter counterparty variation margins. Some derivative contracts are fully cash 
collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for Shell's business activities may not be available. Management believes that it has access 
to sufficient cash and cash equivalents, debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable 
requirements. Information about borrowing facilities is presented in Note 21.
Derivative contracts and hedges
Derivative contracts such as forwards, futures, options and swaps are used principally to hedge or mitigate risks arising from interest rate changes, 
currency fluctuations and commodity price volatility. However, hedge accounting is not always applied, therefore, movements in the carrying 
amounts of derivative contracts that are recognised in income may not be matched in the same period by the recognition of the income effects 
of the related hedged items. 
In the course of trading operations, certain contracts are entered into for delivery of commodities that are accounted for as derivatives. 
The resulting price exposures are managed by entering into related derivative contracts. 
Derivative contracts classified below as "other contracts" include certain contracts for the sale or purchase of commodities and others containing 
embedded derivatives. These contracts are required to be recognised at fair value because of pricing or delivery conditions, even though they 
were entered into to meet operational requirements.
For certain commodity derivatives contracts, carrying amounts cannot be derived from quoted market prices or other observable inputs, in which 
case fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, such as Black-Scholes; option spread models; and extrapolation, using quoted spreads 
with assumptions developed internally based on observable market activity.
Carrying amounts, maturities and hedges

Net gains before tax on derivative contracts, excluding those designed as hedges, were $1,314 million in 2024 (2023: $5,189 million gains; 
2022: $1,331 million gains). 
Certain contracts, mainly to hedge price risk relating to forecast commodity transactions, were designated in cash flow hedging relationships 
and are presented after the offset of related margin balances with exchanges. Contracts to hedge foreign exchange risks were also designated 
in cash flow hedging relationships and the net carrying amount of these contracts at December 31, 2024, was a liability of $579 million 
(2023: $373 million liability). See Note 29 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.
Certain interest rate and currency swaps were designated in fair value hedges, principally in respect of debt for which the net carrying amount 
of the related derivative contracts, net of accrued interest, at December 31, 2024, was a liability of $1,872 million (2023: $1,441 million liability). 
At December 31, 2024, no debt instruments (2023: nil) were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, relating to the foreign 
exchange risk arising between certain intermediate holding companies and their subsidiaries. See Note 29 for the accumulated balance 
recognised within other comprehensive income.

At the Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 21, 2024, the Board was authorised to allot ordinary shares in the Company, and to 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into ordinary shares in the Company, up to an aggregate nominal amount of approximately 
€150 million (representing approximately 2,147 million ordinary shares of €0.07 each), and to list such shares or rights on any stock exchange. 
This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 20, 2025, and the end of the AGM to be held in 2025, unless previously 
renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting.
At the May 21, 2024, AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase (i) up to 644.2 million ordinary shares "on-
market" (excluding any treasury shares), less the number of ordinary shares purchased or committed to be purchased in terms of the buyback 
contracts ("off-market"), made under the authority in (ii); and (ii) up to 644.2 million ordinary shares off-market, less any on-market purchases 
made under the authority in (i).
In the case of both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares, the minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for 
an ordinary share is €0.07 and the maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount 
equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid in relation to ordinary shares on the trading 
venues where the purchase is carried out. The authorities for both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares will expire at the 
earlier of the close of business on August 20, 2025, and the end of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2025. Ordinary shares purchased 
by the Company pursuant to these authorities will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are 
owned by the Company itself.

The merger reserve and share premium reserve were established as a consequence of the Company becoming the single parent company of Royal 
Dutch Petroleum Company and The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company, plc, now The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited, in 2005. 
The merger reserve increased in 2016 following the issuance of shares for the acquisition of BG Group plc. 
The capital redemption reserve was established in connection with repurchases of shares of the Company. 
The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 28). The movement comprises the net of the 
charge for the year and the release as a result of vested awards.

31. Earnings per share
2024 2023 2022
Income attributable to Shell plc shareholders ($ million)  16,094 19,359 42,309
Weighted average number of shares used as the basis for determining:
Basic earnings per share (million of shares)  6,299.6  6,733.5  7,347.5 
Diluted earnings per share (million of shares)  6,363.7  6,799.8  7,410.5 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the income attributable to Shell plc shareholders for the year by the weighted average 
number of shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of shares outstanding excludes shares held in trust.
Diluted earnings per share are based on the same income figures. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is 
increased by dilutive shares related to share-based compensation plans. If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares could decrease diluted 
loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted 
earnings per share.
32. Legal proceedings and other contingencies
General
In the ordinary course of business, Shell subsidiaries are subject to a number of contingencies arising from litigation and claims brought by 
governmental authorities, including tax authorities and private parties. The operations and earnings of Shell subsidiaries continue, from time to 
time, to be affected to varying degrees by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to the protection of the 
environment and indigenous groups in the countries where they operate. The industries in which Shell subsidiaries are engaged are also subject to 
physical risks of various types.
The amounts claimed in relation to such events and, if such claims against Shell were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in 
the various cases could be substantial. Based on information available to date and taking into account that in some cases it is not practicable to 
estimate the possible magnitude or timing of any resultant payments, management believes that the foregoing are not expected to have a material 
adverse impact on Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty around these contingencies, 
as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
Costs in respect of decommissioning and restoration obligations are subject to uncertain timing and amount, and are dependent on various 
factors that are not always within management's control (see Note 25). In certain divestment transactions, liabilities related to decommissioning 
and restoration are de-recognised upon transfer of these obligations to the buyer. In certain cases, Shell retains a secondary obligation for 
decommissioning activities, either via reversionary legislation or the issuance of guarantees, in case the primary obligor is not able to meet its 
obligation. These exposures are actively monitored, and the likelihood of a liability arising in respect of these obligations is not considered probable.
Decommissioning and restoration of manufacturing facilities
For long-lived manufacturing facilities, where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away, while there is a present obligation 
that has arisen from past events, the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured. This is because the settlement dates are indeterminate; 
and other estimates, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, cannot be reliably determined. 
Consequently, the decommissioning and restoration obligation that exists for such long-lived manufacturing facilities cannot be reliably quantified 
and is disclosed as a contingent liability. There remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning such obligations and their potential effects on 
future operations, earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.

32. Legal proceedings and other contingencies continued
Pesticide litigation 
Shell, along with another agricultural chemical pesticide manufacturer and several distributors, has been sued by public and quasi-public water 
purveyors, water storage districts and private landowners alleging responsibility for groundwater contamination caused by applications of 
chemical pesticides. There are approximately nine such cases currently pending, four claims made but not yet filed, and an active subpoena 
for records. These matters assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, seeking to recover actual damages, including drinking well 
treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. Shell continues to vigorously defend these actions. Based on the claims 
asserted and Shell's history regarding amounts paid to resolve varying actions, management does not expect the outcome of the matters pending 
at December 31, 2024, to have a material adverse impact on Shell USA. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the 
potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's 
financial condition.
Climate change litigation
In the USA, energy companies (including Shell), industry associations, and others have been named in several matters alleging responsibility for 
the impacts of climate change due to the use of fossil fuels. These matters assert various theories of liability for a wide variety of harms, including 
but not limited to, impacts to public and private infrastructure, natural resources, and public health and services. As of December 31, 2024, 31 
lawsuits naming Shell as a defendant were pending. 
In the Netherlands, in a case against Shell brought by a group of environmental non-governmental organisations and individual claimants 
(referred to herein as "Milieudefensie"), the Hague District Court in 2021 found that while Shell was not acting unlawfully, Shell had the obligation 
to reduce the aggregate annual volume of CO2 emissions of Shell operations and energy-carrying products sold across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 45% 
(net) by the end of 2030 relative to its 2019 emissions levels. For Scopes 2 and 3, this was a significant best-efforts obligation. Shell appealed that 
ruling. On November 12, 2024, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld Shell's appeal and dismissed the claim against Shell. In doing so, the Court of 
Appeal annulled the earlier judgment of the District Court in its entirety with immediate effect. On February 11, 2025, Milieudefensie filed an 
appeal to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.
Management believes the outcome of these matters should be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell, but there remains a high degree of 
uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and 
Shell's financial condition. 
NAM (Groningen gas field) litigation
Since 1963, NAM – a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50%:50%) – has been producing gas from the Groningen field, the 
largest gas field in Western Europe. After smaller tremors in the 1990s and the late 2000s, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale 
occurred in 2012, causing damage to properties in the affected area. NAM has successfully settled close to 80,000 claims for physical damage 
to property. The Dutch State has taken over the damage-claim-handling from NAM for all claim categories, and the strengthening operation in 
the region, while NAM remains financially responsible insofar as the costs corresponded to NAM's liability. In 2022, NAM started arbitrations 
with the Dutch government to have its financial liability determined for costs which the Dutch government compensated to claimants and 
subsequently charged to NAM. These claims include but are not limited to physical damage to property, housing value loss, emotional damage, 
and loss of living enjoyment. Arbitral awards in the strengthening and damages arbitrations are expected to be rendered in March and Summer 
2025 respectively.
Shell is seeking to reach a final, all-encompassing settlement with the Dutch government on the new design of the Dutch "Gasgebouw" 
earthquake costs and the wind-down of natural gas production in Groningen. Shell, ExxonMobil and the Dutch government reached agreements 
in 2018 (Heads of Agreement) and 2019 (Interim Agreement) and subsequently have been engaged in discussions on the interpretation and 
implementation of these agreements and on a final and all-encompassing settlement. As these discussions have not led to such a settlement, 
in December 2023, the NAM shareholders asked an independent arbitration panel to rule on the interpretation and implementation of 
the agreements made in 2018/2019. The purpose of this arbitration is for a neutral third party to assess the situation and provide clarity. 
The arbitration is expected to take several years, and the judgement will be binding. The arbitration does not preclude a final and all-
encompassing settlement, provided Shell, ExxonMobil and the Dutch government agree to pursue such a settlement. 
There remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning the ultimate outcome of these disputes and their potential effect on future operations, 
earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.

32. Legal proceedings and other contingencies continued
Kazakhstan
Shell has several matters in dispute involving the Republic of Kazakhstan. One litigation matter involving a Shell NOV relates to a Sulphur 
permitting inspection outcome. An unfavourable ruling was issued by the Administrative Collegium of Astana City Court in February 2024. 
The Shell NOV filed an appeal in March 2024 to the Kazakhstan Supreme Court which is pending. 
The other matters are ongoing disputes involving two Shell NOVs under the applicable production-sharing contracts. 
At this time, it is not possible to reliably estimate the magnitude and timing of any possible obligations or payments in respect of the matters above 
or whether any payments will be due. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcomes, as well as the potential effect 
on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
Nigerian litigation
Shell (in its capacity as previous owner of SPDC) and various subsidiaries and associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various 
environmental, non-environmental and contractual disputes brought in the courts of Nigeria, the USA and England. These disputes are at different 
stages in arbitration and litigation, including at the appellate stage, where judgements have been rendered against Shell entities in some of these 
disputes. If taken at face value, the aggregate amount of these judgements could be seen as material. Management, however, believes that the 
outcomes of these disputes, once determined, will be favourable to Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding these 
cases, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.
OPL 245
In March 2017, criminal charges alleging official corruption and conspiracy to commit official corruption were filed against SNEPCO, one then 
current now former Shell employee and third parties including ENI SpA and one of its subsidiaries. Those charges were struck out for want of 
diligent prosecution and the proceedings have been dismissed. However, they can be refiled. In March 2017, parties alleging to be shareholders 
of Malabu Oil and Gas Company Ltd. (Malabu) filed two actions to challenge the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to Oil Prospecting 
Licence 245 (OPL 245) with regard to potential anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and the award of OPL 245 to 
SNEPCO and an ENI SpA subsidiary by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Both actions are currently stayed awaiting the outcome of appeals 
filed against procedural decisions. Those appeal proceedings are ongoing. On May 8, 2018, Human Environmental Development Agenda 
(HEDA) sought permission from the Federal High Court of Nigeria to apply for an order to direct the Attorney General of the Federation to revoke 
OPL 245 on grounds that the entire Malabu transaction in relation to the OPL is unconstitutional, illegal and void as it was obtained through 
fraudulent and corrupt practice. On July 3, 2019, the Nigerian Federal High Court upheld objections from SNEPCO and NAE and struck the 
lawsuit filed by HEDA. The suit was struck because of the statute of limitations and lack of jurisdiction to hear the matter. HEDA has appealed 
the judgement, which is ongoing.
On July 21, 2022, the Dutch Public Prosecutor's office announced it had dismissed its investigation into bribery allegations related to OPL 245. 
On October 24, 2022, Re:Common, HEDA and The Corner House announced that they filed a complaint at the Court of Appeal in The Hague, 
pursuant to Article 12 of the Dutch Code for Criminal Procedure, challenging the decision by the Dutch Public Prosecutor to dismiss its investigation. 
On March 20, 2025, the Court of Appeal in The Hague dismissed this complaint. There remains a high degree of uncertainty around the OPL 245 
matters and contingencies discussed above, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial 
condition. Accordingly, at this time, it is not possible to reliably estimate the possible obligations and timing of any payments. Any violation of anti-
bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering legislation could have a material adverse effect on Shell plc's earnings, cash flows and financial 
condition.
Russia
On October 2, 2024, the Russian prosecutor filed a Moscow court claim against eight Shell-group entities (including Shell plc and Shell Energy 
Europe Limited ("SEEL")). The prosecutor seeks (i) declarations that Shell illegally abandoned in support of Sakhalin Energy Investment Company 
("Sakhalin"); (ii) monetary relief of approximately €1.5 billion from SEEL to Gazprom Export ("GPE") for alleged unpaid gas deliveries in 2022; and 
(iii) a declaration that GPE can take 94₽ billion purportedly set aside for Shell for Sakhalin equity compensation from a Type-C account to net off 
against part of the alleged debt owed by SEEL to GPE. On January 30, 2025, SEEL filed a written postponement motion in the Moscow court 
proceedings regarding SEEL's non-payment of GPE gas invoices and Sakhalin. At a court hearing on February 14, 2025, the judge postponed the 
proceedings until the next hearing, which is scheduled for April 14, 2025.
At this time, it is not possible to reliably estimate the magnitude and timing of any possible obligations or payments in respect of the matters above 
or whether any payments will be due. There remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcomes, as well as the potential effect 
on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.

36. Post-balance sheet events
On January 23, 2025, and March 4, 2025, Shell announced changes to the Executive Committee. As per the announcements, with effect from 
April 1, 2025, the most senior leadership structure will be delayered to reflect the three primary areas of business value – Integrated Gas; 
Upstream; and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions, while elevating Trading and Supply. These changes will not affect Shell's 
reporting segments as the changes do not impact how the Chief Executive Officer, who serves as the Chief Operating Decision Maker, makes 
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance.
On January 30, 2025, Shell announced the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback programme (the "programme") covering an 
aggregate contract term of approximately three months. The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. 
All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that, subject to market conditions, the programme will be 
completed prior to the Company's first quarter 2025 results announcement, scheduled for May 2, 2025. The Company has entered into an 
arrangement with a single broker consisting of two irrevocable, non-discretionary contracts, to enable the purchase of ordinary shares.
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) to Renaissance, as 
announced on January 16, 2024. The divestment of SPDC aligns with Shell's intent to simplify its presence in Nigeria through an exit of onshore 
oil production in the Niger Delta and a focus of future disciplined investment in its deep-water and integrated gas positions. As part of the 
transaction, Shell has also provided loan facilities. No significant impairments are expected as a result of completion of the transaction.

Supplementary information – oil and gas (unaudited)
About this section
The purpose of this section is to comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) "Extractive Activities – Oil and 
Gas (Topic 932)". Extractive activities for this purpose include exploration and production activities to extract oil, condensates, natural gas liquids, 
oil sands and natural gas from their natural reservoirs.
In Shell, extractive activities, or oil and gas exploration and production activities, are undertaken within the Integrated Gas, Upstream and 
the Chemicals and Products (includes oil sands) segments. Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of Integrated Gas, Upstream 
and Chemicals and Products activities, and exclude GTL processing, some LNG activities, trading and optimisation, as well as other non-extractive 
activities. As a result, the information in this extractive activities section is not suitable for modelling Shell's integrated businesses, for which we refer 
to the segment information. Full segment information to the Consolidated Financial Statements is available on pages 268-273.
The information set out on pages 313-332 is referred to as "unaudited" as a means of clarifying that it is not covered by the audit opinion of the 
independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Proved reserves
Proved reserves estimates are calculated pursuant to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules and the FASB's Topic 932. 
Proved reserves can be either developed or undeveloped. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4–10 (a) of Regulation S-X. 
We include proved reserves associated with future production that will be consumed in operations. 
Proved reserves shown are net of any quantities of crude oil or natural gas that are expected to be (or could be) taken as royalties in kind. Proved 
reserves outside North America include quantities that will be settled as royalties in cash. Proved reserves include certain quantities of crude oil or 
natural gas that will be produced under arrangements that involve Shell subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in risks and rewards but do not 
transfer title of the product to those entities. 
Subsidiaries' proved reserves at December 31, 2024, were divided into 78% developed and 22% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent (boe) 
basis. For the Shell share of joint ventures and associates, the proved reserves at December 31, 2024, were divided into 35% developed and 65% 
undeveloped on a boe basis. 
Proved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements. Shell's proved reserves volumes at December 31, 2024, present 
in agreements such as production-sharing contracts (PSC), tax/variable royalty contracts or other forms of economic entitlement contracts, where 
the Shell share of reserves can vary with commodity prices, were 2,153 million barrels of liquids, and 10,240 thousand million standard cubic feet 
(scf) of natural gas. 
Proved reserves cannot be measured exactly because estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement (see "Risk factors" on page 136 and 
our "Proved reserves assurance process" below). These estimates remain subject to revision and are unaudited supplementary information. 
Proved reserves assurance process
A central group of reserves experts, who on average have around 28 years' experience in the oil and gas industry, undertake the primary 
assurance of the proved reserves bookings. This group of experts is part of the Resources Assurance and Reporting (RAR) organisation within 
Shell. A Vice President with 39 years' experience in the oil and gas industry currently heads the RAR organisation. He is a member of the Society 
of Petroleum Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and holds a BA in mathematics from Oxford University and an MEng in 
Petroleum Engineering from Heriot-Watt University. The RAR organisation reports directly to an Executive Vice President of Finance, who is a 
member of the Upstream Reserves Committee (URC). The URC is a multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior representatives from the 
Finance, Legal, Integrated Gas and Upstream organisations. The URC reviews and endorses all major (larger than 30 million barrels of oil 
equivalent) proved reserves bookings and debookings and endorses the total aggregated proved reserves. Final approval of all proved reserves 
bookings remains with Shell's CEO, and all proved reserves bookings are reviewed by Shell's Audit and Risk Committee. The Internal Audit 
function also provides secondary assurance through audits of the control framework. 
Crude oil, natural gas liquids, synthetic crude oil and bitumen
Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic crude oil and bitumen at the end of the year; their share of 
the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the end of the year; and the changes in such reserves during the year are set out on pages 
314-318. Significant changes in these proved reserves are discussed below (except where specific disclosures are prohibited), where "revisions 
and reclassifications" are changes based on new information that resulted from development drilling, production history and changes in 
economic factors.

SPDC JV to Renaissance. As of December 31, 2024, Shell had proved reserves of 134 million barrels in crude oil in SPDC.
[C] Pursuant to Shell's 2017 agreement with Canadian Natural Resources Limited, its remaining mining interest and associated synthetic crude oil reserves will be swapped for an additional 10% 
interest in the Scotford Upgrader and Quest CCS project. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals. The associated proved 
reserves as of December 31, 2024 were 741 million barrels in synthetic crude oil (of which 50% attributable to non-controlling interest).
[D] On December 5, 2024, Shell along with Equinor ASA, announced the combination of their UK offshore oil and gas assets and expertise to form a new company which will be the UK North 
Sea's biggest independent producer. On deal completion, the new independent producer will be jointly owned by Equinor (50%) and Shell (50%) and 112 million barrels crude oil (as of 
December 31, 2024) of Shell's proved reserves will be contributed to the new joint venture alongside proved reserves contributed by Equinor. Subsequently, Shell will report 50% of the 
proved reserves of the new joint venture as part of Shell's share of proved reserves from joint ventures and associates.

Natural gas
Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves of natural gas at the end of the year, their share of the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the 
end of the year, and the changes in such reserves during the years are set out on pages 319-322. Significant changes in these proved reserves
are discussed below (except where specific disclosures are prohibited).
Volumes are not adjusted to standard heat content. Apart from integrated projects, volumes of gas are reported on an "as-sold" basis. The price 
used to calculate future revenue and cash flows from proved gas reserves is the contract price or the 12-month average on "as-sold" volumes. 
Volumes associated with integrated projects are those measured at a designated transfer point between the upstream and downstream portions 
of the integrated project. Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel.

Standardised measure of discounted future cash flows 
SEC Form 20-F requires the disclosure of a standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows, relating to proved reserves quantities and 
based on a 12-month unweighted arithmetic average sales price, calculated on a first-day-of-the-month basis, with cost factors based on those at 
the end of each year, currently enacted tax rates and a 10% annual discount factor. In our view, the information so calculated does not provide a 
reliable measure of future cash flows from proved reserves, nor does it permit a realistic comparison to be made of one entity with another 
because the assumptions used cannot reflect the varying circumstances within each entity. In addition, a substantial but unknown proportion of 
future real cash flows from oil and gas production activities is expected to derive from reserves which have already been discovered, but which 
cannot yet be regarded as proved.

Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements of Shell plc (the "Company") have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards 
and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. As applied to Shell, there 
are no material differences from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB); therefore, the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
As described in the material accounting policies in Note 2, the Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, 
except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods.
The Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting, as set out in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements (see page 245).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
The financial results of the Company are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 240-312. The financial results of the 
Company incorporate the results of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the "Trust").
The Company's principal activity is being the parent company for Shell, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
(see page 245).
2. Material accounting policies, judgements and estimates 
The Company's accounting policies follow those of Shell as set out in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 245-255. 
The following are Company-specific policies. 
Presentation and functional currency 
The Company's presentation and functional currency is US dollars (dollars). 
Investments 
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, net of any impairment. Investments are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those investments may not be recoverable. For the purposes of determining whether 
impairment of investments in subsidiaries has occurred, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal, management performs an assessment 
of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. Management's conclusion may be determined by using one or both of these methodologies as 
appropriate. For key judgements applied in reaching management's conclusion, please see Note 5.
The original cost of the Company's investment in Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch) was based on the fair value of the shares 
transferred to the Company by the former shareholders of Royal Dutch in exchange for A shares in the Company during the public exchange offer 
in 2005. The original cost of the Company's investment in The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company p.l.c., now The Shell Transport and Trading 
Company Limited (Shell Transport), was the fair value of the shares held by the former shareholders of The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company 
p.l.c., transferred in consideration for the issuance of B shares as part of the Scheme of Arrangement in 2005. The Company's investments in Royal 
Dutch and Shell Transport subsequently became an investment in Shell Petroleum N.V., now Shell Petroleum B.V. (Shell Petroleum); this change 
had no impact on the cost of investments in subsidiaries. On February 15, 2016, the Company acquired all the voting rights in BG Group plc via 
the issuance of shares and cash payments of a total fair value of $53,086 million. In September 2016, the Company's shares in BG Group Limited 
(BG), formerly BG Group plc, were exchanged for an increased investment in Shell Petroleum. This change had no impact on the cost of 
investments in subsidiaries. 
On October 16, 2023, the Company contributed its investment in Shell Petroleum to another subsidiary, Shell Group Holding Limited, in exchange 
for the issuance of 99 shares with a nominal value of $1 issued at a premium of $257,493 million, reflecting the carrying amount of the Company's 
investment in Shell Petroleum. This transaction had no impact on the cost of investments in subsidiaries.
Dividend income 
Dividends are recognised on a paid basis unless the dividend has been confirmed by a general meeting of Shell Group Holding Limited, in which 
case income is recognised on the date at which receipt is deemed virtually certain. 
Share-based compensation plans 
The fair value of share-based compensation for equity-settled plans granted to employees of subsidiaries under the Company's plans is recognised 
as an investment in subsidiaries from the date of grant over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. 
In the year of vesting of a plan, the costs for the actual deliveries are charged to the relevant employing subsidiaries. This is recognised as a 
realisation of the investment originally booked. If the actual vesting costs are higher than the cumulatively recognised share-based compensation 
charge, the difference is recognised in income. 
See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 305-306 for information on the Company's principal plan.

Taxation 
The Company is tax-resident in the UK (see Note 8).
3. Changes to IFRS not yet adopted
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements ("IFRS 18")
IFRS 18 was issued in April 2024 and will replace IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. IFRS 18 will be effective from reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2027. This standard sets out requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial 
statements, particularly the Statement of Income. From Shell's initial impact assessment of IFRS 18, it is expected that the implementation
will have very limited impact on the Company financial statements.

At December 31  257,697  257,694 
As at December 31, 2024, the market capitalisation of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Group") was less than
the Company's carrying value of its investment in the Group. Management has therefore performed an impairment test to determine whether 
recoverable amount exceeded the cost of investment recognised. 
Recoverable amount was assessed by reference to fair value less costs of disposal. This was calculated by comparing the cost of investment with 
the Group's market capitalisation, adjusted to reflect a control premium. In determining the premium and costs of disposal, available data from 
recent market transactions in comparable industries, conducted at arm's length for similar assets, have been taken into account.
This resulted in a recoverable amount exceeding the cost of investment recognised and is consistent with management's expectation of the future 
recoverability of the Company's investment in the Group. As fair value less costs of disposal exceeded cost, no separate value in use calculation 
was undertaken.
The recoverability of the Company's investment in the Group may be influenced by the risk factors of the Group, including commodity prices, 
market supply and demand, expected production volumes and developments related to climate change and the energy transition (see Note 4
to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 255-265).

The UK corporate income tax rate applicable for the year ended December 31, 2024, is 25%. Deferred taxes on the Balance Sheet have been 
measured at 25%, which represents the future corporate income tax rate that was enacted at the balance sheet date. The Finance Act 2021 
(enacted on May 24, 2021) increased the main rate of UK corporate income tax to 25% with effect from April 1, 2023.
On June 20, 2023, the UK substantively enacted Pillar Two Model Rules, effective as from January 1, 2024. The Pillar Two rules are designed to 
ensure large multinational enterprises (meeting certain conditions) pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they 
operate. Shell has applied the exception, as set out in the amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, to recognising and disclosing information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.
9. Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost in the Company's Balance Sheet comprise amounts due from subsidiaries (see Note 15) 
and certain amounts reported within accounts payable and accrued liabilities (see Note 7). The fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
measured at amortised cost at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, approximates their carrying amount.
Information on financial risk management is presented in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 299-302). Foreign currency 
derivatives are used by the Company to manage foreign exchange risk, which arises when certain transactions are denominated in a currency that 
is not the Company's functional currency. No derivative financial instruments were held at December 31, 2024, or December 31, 2023.

At the Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 21, 2024, the Board was authorised to allot ordinary shares in the Company, and to 
grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into ordinary shares in the Company, up to an aggregate nominal amount of approximately 
€150 million (representing approximately 2,147 million ordinary shares of €0.07 each), and to list such shares or rights on any stock exchange. 
This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 20, 2025, and the end of the AGM to be held in 2025, unless previously 
renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting.
At the May 21, 2024 AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase (i) up to 644.2 million ordinary shares "on-market"
(excluding any treasury shares), less the number of ordinary shares purchased or committed to be purchased under the buyback contracts
("off-market"), made under the authority in (ii); and (ii) up to 644.2 million ordinary shares off-market, less any on-market purchases made under 
the authority in (i).

10. Share capital continued
In the case of both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares, the minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for 
an ordinary share is €0.07 and the maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount 
equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; 
and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid in relation to ordinary shares on the trading 
venues where the purchase is carried out. The authorities for both on-market and off-market purchases of the ordinary shares will expire at the 
earlier of the close of business on August 20, 2025, and the end of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2025. Ordinary shares purchased 
by the Company pursuant to these authorities will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are 
owned by the Company itself.
All shares repurchased in 2024 under the Company's share buyback programme were cancelled except for repurchases on December 30 and 
December 31 which were cancelled in January 2025. 
For information on the number of shares in the Company held by Shell employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities to meet delivery 
commitments under employee share plans, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 305-306). 
Assimilation of A and B shares
On January 29, 2022, the Company completed the assimilation of A and B shares into a single class of share, following the change in tax 
residence to the UK with effect from December 31, 2021. After this date, dividend payments made by the Company with the use of the dividend 
access mechanism were restricted to the settlement of amounts unclaimed in respect of dividends declared on Class B shares prior to assimilation.
At December 31, 2024 unclaimed dividends of £3 million (December 31, 2023: £4 million) remain in respect of dividends declared on Class B 
shares prior to assimilation.
At the Company's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on May 23, 2023, the Articles of Association were amended to reduce the period after which 
unclaimed dividends are forfeited, from 12 years to 6 years.

The merger reserve was established as a consequence of the Company becoming the single parent company of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport 
and represented the difference between the cost of the investment in those companies and the nominal value of shares issued in exchange for 
those investments as required by the prevailing legislation at that time, section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. On February 15, 2016, the 
Company acquired all shares in BG Group plc by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Act, via the issuance of 218.7 million
A shares and 1,305.1 million B shares and cash payments. This resulted in an increase in the merger reserve, representing the difference between 
the fair value and the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company. 
On January 6, 2006, loan notes were converted into 4,827,974 A shares. The difference between the carrying value of the loan notes and the 
nominal value of the new shares issued was credited to the share premium reserve. The capital redemption reserve was established in connection 
with repurchases of shares of the Company. The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 28 to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements) and movement in share-based compensation for the year is the net of the charge to equity and the release 
as a result of vested awards.

The amount due from Shell Treasury Centre Limited (STCL) comprises call deposits and overdrafts in dollars, sterling and euros. Interest is 
calculated using arm's-length benchmark 3-day median quotes on dollar, sterling and euro balances. Net interest income in 2024 from STCL
was $320 million (2023: $320 million). During the year, the Company was recharged costs from The Shell Petroleum Company Limited of 
$264 million (2023: nil) and The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited of $37 million (2023: $304 million).
Other transactions and balances 
The Company periodically enters into forward and spot foreign currency contracts with Treasury companies, which are subsidiaries. There were 
no open foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2024, or December 31, 2023. 
The Company settles general and administrative expenses of the Trust, including the auditor's remuneration.
The Company has guaranteed contractual payments totalling $31,778 million at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: $48,356 million), 
and related interest, in respect of listed debt issued by Shell International Finance B.V. The fair value of this guarantee was considered to be 
immaterial at initial recognition and since the likelihood of default is considered remote no subsequent expected credit losses have been 
recognised.
On January 11, 2023, the Company guaranteed contractual payments totalling $2,825 million at December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023: 
$2,932 million), and related interest, in respect of listed debt issued by BG Energy Capital plc, in place of the previous guarantor, BG Energy 
Holdings Limited. Both entities are subsidiaries of the Company. The fair value of this guarantee was considered to be immaterial at initial 
recognition and since the likelihood of default is considered remote no subsequent expected credit losses have been recognised.
On October 4, 2024, the Company guaranteed contractual payments totalling $11,443 million at December 31, 2024, and related interest, in 
respect of listed debt issued by Shell Finance US Inc. This entity is a subsidiary of the Company. The fair value of this guarantee was considered 
to be immaterial at initial recognition and since the likelihood of default is considered remote no subsequent expected credit losses have 
been recognised.
16. Auditor's remuneration
See Note 35 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 312).
17. Post-balance sheet events
On January 30, 2025, Shell announced the commencement of a $3,500 million share buyback programme covering an aggregate contract term 
of approximately three months (the "programme"). The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. All shares 
repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that, subject to market conditions, the programme will be completed prior 
to the Company's first quarter 2025 results announcement, scheduled for May 2, 2025. The Company has entered into an arrangement with 
a single broker consisting of two irrevocable, non-discretionary contracts, to enable the purchase of ordinary shares.

General disclosures (ESRS 2)
General basis for preparation of Sustainability 
Statements (BP-1)
In anticipation of the transposition by the Netherlands of the EU 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) into national law, 
Shell's Sustainability Statements for the year ended December 31, 
2024, are presented on a voluntary basis. The Sustainability 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the CSRD and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(ESRS). 
Owing to differences in the timing and nature of the transposition 
of the CSRD into national law across European Economic Area 
(EEA) members, there is an absence of uniform practice upon which 
regulators, professional bodies, preparers and auditors can draw. 
Differences in the timing of transposition by different jurisdictions, 
coupled with the lack of a standardised approach to evaluating the 
Sustainability Statements, may impact comparability between entities.
Section headers in the Sustainability Statements follow the structure of 
the ESRS. Terms and definitions used in the text are defined by Shell 
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The Sustainability Statements are prepared on a consolidated basis. 
The scope of assets subject to consolidation is consistent with that of 
the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 241-312. The basis 
of consolidation specified by the ESRS varies per topic and is not 
consistent with Shell's historical reporting, which is informed by industry 
standards and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard.
In line with industry practice, Shell has historically reported sustainability 
data using the operational control boundary, whereby data are reported 
on a 100% basis for assets under operational control. This approach 
reflects the prevalence of joint operations in the oil and gas sector and 
the common industry practice of designating an operating partner to 
create and apply operating policies and standards. 
For individual environmental and social topics, the ESRS specify an 
applicable reporting boundary. This includes reporting on a financial 
control basis (for water and resource use and circular economy), 
reporting based on relationships (for own workforce, workers in the 
value chain and affected communities) and reporting based on a 
combination of operational and financial control in a new "ESRS 
boundary" (for greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and biodiversity). 
Many of these boundaries differ from Shell's historical reporting. 
The table below illustrates the key differences between reporting on an 
operational control or financial control basis and the "ESRS boundary" 
that applies to the environmental topics mentioned above.

[A] Shell reports Scope 3 emissions using an equity boundary. Under this approach, we report 
the Shell share of emissions from energy products sold, including those sourced from third 
parties.
For the E1 Climate change standard, we report in 2024 against all 
required boundaries, as shown in the table "Scope of Consolidation" 
below. This includes the new ESRS boundary applied to greenhouse 
gas emissions that differs from the financial statements, industry 
standards and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. For the remaining 
environmental standards, we report data against an operational 
control boundary as well as the boundaries required by the ESRS, 
making use of estimates where actual data from non-operated ventures 
is unavailable. For social and governance topics we report data in line 
with the ESRS. Further details are provided below.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 
published in 2004, provides global requirements and guidance on how 
to report emissions through standardised approaches and principles. 
ESRS E1 Climate change requires consideration of the GHG Protocol 
when preparing information for reporting GHG emissions. For Scope 1 
and 2 emissions, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol recognises three 
reporting boundaries: operational control (reporting on a 100% basis 
for assets under operational control), financial control (reporting on a 
100% basis for fully consolidated subsidiaries and percentage interest 
for joint operations) and equity share (reporting according to the 
ownership share).
The GHG Protocol recognises that in many industries, operational and 
financial control are the same with the "notable exception being the oil 
and gas industry". As a result, when oil and gas companies choose to 
report against a control boundary, the GHG Protocol requires that they 
make a choice between reporting on the basis of operational control or 
financial control. Shell has reported GHG emissions against an 
operational control boundary in prior periods, and again in 2024, 
because this best reflects our ability to directly control operations by 
applying our own policies and standards.
The ESRS E1 Climate change standard establishes a fourth boundary 
that combines the operational control and financial control boundaries. 
This "ESRS boundary" is intended to present a full span of control from 
both a financial and operational perspective. In doing so, however, it 
results in a divergence from the three consolidation methods provided 
by the GHG Protocol. The ESRS boundary also results in partial double 
counting of emissions across the industry, as the operator will report 
100% of the emissions and partners may report their share of the same 
emissions.
For GHG emissions, Shell reports against an operational control, equity 
and ESRS boundary for operated and non-operated ventures.

---- Page 345 ----
Other environmental, social and governance data
To report environmental, social and governance data against either a 
financial control or ESRS boundary requires access to data from non-
operated ventures. More than half of the ventures in which Shell is a 
partner are non-operated, with partners comprising both state-owned 
and international companies. Shell has more than 50 joint operations 
not under operational control that fall within the ESRS boundary, of 
which 85% operate outside the European Economic Area. These 
ventures are not subject to the CSRD, nor are they contractually 
obliged under the operator agreement to provide the volume and 
granularity of data required by the ESRS. 
The feasibility of obtaining information from non-operated ventures 
has been additionally impacted by the short adoption period, with 
publication of the final ESRS occurring in the second half of 2023 
for first reporting on January 1, 2024, and guidance on reporting 
boundaries being published several months subsequent to that date.
For environmental metrics other than greenhouse gas contained in 
the E2–E5 standards, Shell sample-tested data availability from non-
operated ventures and observed gaps in availability, quality and 
completeness. We have therefore, in accordance with the ESRS, 
estimated the data for non-operated ventures, covering approximately 
60 metrics across more than 50 non-operated ventures. See 
"Supplementary data for pollution, water, biodiversity and waste, 
including estimates for non-operated assets" on pages 434-437 for a 
presentation of this information along with details of the estimation 
methodologies, limitations and uncertainties.
Shell does not have operational control over how non-operated 
ventures embed sustainability in their operations. This risk of having 
less control while still being exposed to risks associated with these 
operations, including environmental risks, is described in our Risk 
factors. See "Portfolio risks" on pages 135-137 for more information. The 
risk associated with non-operated ventures is managed by appointing 
Shell representatives whose responsibility is to manage performance, 
and create and protect value for Shell. These representatives seek to 
influence operators and other partners to adopt appropriate practices 
to drive value and to mitigate risk. This includes regular assessments of 
how the non-operated venture's standards align with Shell's and seek to 
influence closure of any identified gaps. 
We continue to engage with peers, joint venture partners, standard 
setters and others on the topic of reporting boundaries. We advocate 
a common approach through global and interoperable reporting 
standards, combined with adequate multi-year transition timelines, to 
access non-operated venture data through industry-wide collaboration.
Boundaries applied in 2024
For the 2024 Sustainability Statements, Shell applies the consolidation 
scopes set out below. Further details of how these boundaries are

Some EU member states have not yet transposed the CSRD into 
national law. As of December 31, 2024, none of Shell's subsidiaries 
included in the scope of consolidation had an individual or 
consolidated reporting obligation in 2024 pursuant to Articles 19a(9) 
or 29a(8) of the EU Accounting Directive. One Shell subsidiary in 
Spain, Shell España, S.A., would be exempted from the obligation to 
report individually in the event that Spain, which has not yet adopted 
the CSRD, were to do so and require retroactive application for 2024.
Value chain
For the purposes of our 2024 Sustainability Statements, a simplified 
version of Shell's value chain is shown below. This classification is used 
to guide our assessment of material topics and decisions about the 
content of our disclosures under the ESRS. 
We follow the general classification of value chain provided in ESRS, 
which distinguishes between own operations, upstream value chain 
and downstream value chain. 
Sustainability Statements | ESRS2 General continued
343 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 346 ----
Own operations and value chain
Shell's own operations comprise companies, joint operations, joint 
ventures and associates where we are the operator and exercise 
operational control and/or where the activities are reported under 
financial control. Our own operations span activities related to the 
production of hydrocarbons and power, processing, trading, sales and 
distribution. Our upstream value chain consists of direct and indirect 
suppliers of hydrocarbons, power, biomass, and other goods and 
services that we transform into energy and non-energy products that 
benefit our customers. Our downstream value chain consists of 
customers and their use of our sold products. References to "upstream 
value chain" and "downstream value chain" in the Sustainability 
Statements have the meaning given above and do not refer to our 
Upstream business segment or to our Downstream, Renewables 
and Energy Solutions directorate.
Actors in our value chain are individuals or entities in our upstream or 
downstream value chain. An actor is considered upstream from Shell 
when it provides goods or services used in the production of our own 
products or services. An actor is considered downstream from Shell 
when it receives products or services from us.
Actors in our upstream value chain include direct and indirect suppliers, 
strategic partners and non-operated ventures, among others. Actors 
in our downstream value chain include retail consumers, business 
customers, non-operated ventures and business partners who 
distribute or market our products.
We extend the scope of the Sustainability Statements on a topic-by-
topic basis to cover material impacts in Shell's value chain where we 
have existing data, policies or actions.
The most significant value chain topic for Shell is Scope 3 emissions. 
More than 90% of the total emissions we include within our net carbon 
intensity (NCI) boundary are indirect emissions associated with third-
party products and end-use emissions of energy products we sell.
Within the 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions, we assess four 
categories as significant: Category 1 Purchased goods and services, 
Category 3 Fuel and energy-related activities, Category 9 Downstream 
transport and distribution and Category 11 Emissions from the use of 
sold products. These categories cover value chain emission impacts for 
the purchase, transport and use of energy products by the customer.
Our policies often have direct or indirect application for actors in our 
value chain, such as suppliers and non-operated ventures. Our 
qualitative disclosures indicate how our policies are applied in Shell 
companies and operated joint ventures, as well as our expectation that 
non-operated ventures adopt appropriate and acceptable policies to 
manage their risks. Our qualitative disclosures also cover policies 
covering actors in our upstream value chain, such as the Shell Supplier 
Principles, our standards for worker welfare, and our approach to 
enhanced value chain due diligence. 
In 2024, we made efforts to obtain additional value chain information 
for selected topics, such as seeking deeper insight from suppliers into 
potential human rights impacts in our upstream value chain. We use 
provisions in the ESRS to phase in certain value chain related 
disclosures during this transitional period. We generally use this phase-
in provision when we are still assessing the nature of potential value 
chain impacts and the associated data needed for reporting, where 
regulatory requirements are uncertain, or where it is not yet possible to 
obtain reliable information owing to contractual restrictions or other 
factors. We aim to deepen our understanding and enhance our 
reporting on the value chain.
Use of other exemptions
We have not used the option to omit information corresponding to 
intellectual property, know-how or the results of innovation. We have 
not used the exemption from disclosure of impending developments or 
matters in the course of negotiation, as provided for in articles 19a(3) 
and 29a(3) of the EU Accounting Directive.
Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances (BP-2)
Time horizons
The time horizons prescribed by the ESRS for reporting on the short, 
medium and long term differ from those used in Shell for strategy, 
business planning and risk management purposes. 
Because of the inherent uncertainty and pervasive risks across our 
strategy and business model, we monitor sustainability-related impacts, 
risks and opportunities across the following time horizons:
￮Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial 
projections and use them to manage performance and expectations 
on a three-year cycle. These projections incorporate decarbonisation 
measures required to meet our short-term targets.
￮ Medium term (generally 3–10 years): these are embedded within 
our business plan, with our continued focus on the customer, the 
investments and portfolio shifts required in the medium term that 
will reshape Shell's portfolio. 
￮ Long term (generally beyond 10 years): our portfolio and product mix 
is expected to evolve over time with changing customer demand.
For the purposes of our disclosures in the Sustainability Statements, we 
adjust the time horizons described above to follow the ESRS definition 
of "short term" as referring to one year from the end of the current 
reporting period. Owing to the long-term nature of capital investment 
in our industry, we use the option afforded by the ESRS to specify 
different periods for the medium and long term. For the purposes of 
our disclosures in the Sustainability Statements, we therefore define 
"medium term" as generally between 2 and 10 years and "long term" 
as generally beyond 10 years. Many of our impacts, risks and 
opportunities are long term in nature, and therefore we consider the 
differences between the time horizons for reporting under the ESRS 
and those used internally for strategy, business planning and risk 
management to be of limited practical significance.
Value chain estimation
We may use estimates based on indirect sources for reporting certain 
quantitative metrics. Where applicable, further information is provided 
in the notes accompanying the presentation of metrics.
Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty
Certain quantitative metrics disclosed in the Sustainability Statements may 
be subject to measurement uncertainty. Preparation of environmental, 
social and governance data requires us to apply judgement or make use 
of estimates. We make these judgements or estimates based on industry 
standards, applicable regulatory requirements, established operating 
practices, subject matter expertise and other information believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. Consequently, there is an inherent 
uncertainty in our calculations.

Shell has established a system of risk management and internal control 
over sustainability reporting to minimise the risk of reporting errors, 
including in areas requiring the application of judgement or estimates. 
See "Risk management and internal controls over sustainability 
reporting (GOV-5)" on page 347 for information.
Disclosures stemming from other legislation or generally 
accepted sustainability reporting pronouncements
Shell is subject to sustainability disclosure requirements in multiple 
jurisdictions, including the European Union and the United Kingdom. In 
some cases, these requirements may overlap with one another, fully or 
in part. To avoid unnecessary duplication, our disclosures are designed 
to address these requirements in an integrated manner where possible.
Our disclosures in the Sustainability Statements do not include 
information stemming from other legislation that is additional to the 
requirements prescribed by the ESRS. Our disclosures incorporate by 
reference information from outside the Sustainability Statements which 
address an ESRS requirement while also satisfying a similar requirement 
under the regulations of other jurisdictions.
Incorporation by reference
We have chosen to incorporate some of the disclosures required by the 
ESRS by reference to other parts of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
We generally do this to avoid duplication or when the required 
disclosure is best read in conjunction with these sections.
For details of information incorporated in the Sustainability Statements 
by reference to other parts of the Annual Report and Accounts, see 
"Disclosure requirements covered by the Sustainability Statements" 
on pages 358-364.
The role of the administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies (GOV-1)
Members of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies 
consist of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee (EC) of 
Shell plc.
The Board consists of 12 members, including two executive members 
and 10 non-executive members. No members of the Board or EC are 
representatives of employees or other workers. See "The Board of 
Shell plc" on pages 152-156 and "Executive Committee" on pages 
157-158 for information about the skills and experience of members 
of the Board and EC. 
The Board's gender diversity, calculated as an average ratio of female 
to male Board members as at December 31, 2024, is 0.7. Women 
made up 42% of the Board as at December 31, 2024. See "Board 
diversity" on page 156 and "Executive Committee diversity" on page 
157 for other aspects of diversity relevant to the Board and EC.
All non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement, and the percentage of 
independent Board members is 83% as at December 31, 2024.
Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver our 
strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The 
Board is supported by four standing committees: the Sustainability 
Committee (SUSCO), the Remuneration Committee (REMCO), the 
Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and the Nomination and Succession 
Committee (NOMCO). Sustainability-related matters are considered 
as appropriate by the Board or the relevant committee. 
Three management-level committees with representatives from across 
Shell also play a critical role in driving sustainability-related elements 
of our strategy. These include the Capital Investment Committee (CIC), 
the Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC) and the Sustainability 
Management Committee (SMC).
See "Our approach to sustainability" on page 127 for a description 
of governance bodies responsible for sustainability, the role of 
management, procedures for managing sustainability-related 
impacts, risks and opportunities, and reporting lines and controls.
At Group level, the potential impacts of the energy transition on our 
business model and strategy are discussed and assessed by the Board 
and the Executive Committee as part of the annual strategic and 
business planning cycle. This assessment allows us to challenge 
accepted ways of thinking, identify material risks and opportunities, 
and identify key tensions and trade-offs. 
See "Our approach to sustainability" on pages 127-133 for information 
about how the Board oversees the delivery of Shell's strategy and 
monitors performance against longer-term targets.
The NOMCO leads the process for appointments to the Board and 
Senior Management positions (defined as the Executive Committee 
and the Company Secretary), ensures plans are in place for orderly, 
well-planned succession, and oversees the development of a diverse 
succession pipeline of candidates. Consideration of skills and 
experience relevant to sustainability matters is integrated into this 
process. Members of the Board and EC have access to internal and 
external expertise on environmental, social and governance matters.

Leaders at all levels play an essential role with respect to safety, ethics 
and compliance, making it clear through their actions and expectations 
that all business plans and activities must be undertaken in a 
responsible, safe, ethical and compliant manner.
Accountability for ethics and compliance in Shell lies with the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Executive Committee. The Audit and Risk 
Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to 
risk management and internal control, including with respect to ethics 
and compliance-related matters.
We have a Group-wide ethics and compliance programme that focuses 
on embedding our core values and business principles into Shell's 
culture. The programme is directed by Shell's Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer (CECO). The CECO heads Shell's Ethics and 
Compliance Office and reports to the Legal Director. The CECO also 
provides regular updates to the EC and the ARC.
See "The Board of Shell plc" on pages 152-156 and "Executive 
Committee" on pages 157-158 for information on the expertise of 
management and the Board.
Information provided to and sustainability matters 
addressed by the undertaking's administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies (GOV-2)
The Board and EC are informed of and address sustainability matters 
throughout the year. Sustainability matters are reviewed and 
considered on an integrated basis alongside other business issues.
See "Board oversight of sustainability including climate-related impacts, 
risks and opportunities" on page 127 and "Processes by which 
management is informed about sustainability-related issues" on page 
130 for information.
The Board has primary oversight of the delivery of Shell's strategy, 
including the management of sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities. The Board oversaw the setting of our longer-term targets 
announced at Capital Markets Day in June 2023 and our Energy 
Transition Strategy 2024.
There is no fixed number of times that the Board may meet in one year. 
During 2024, the Board met nine times. 
The Sustainability Committee (SUSCO) met four times in 2024, 
with sustainability-related matters discussed at each meeting. The 
Remuneration Committee (REMCO) met five times during 2024, with 
sustainability-related matters relevant to remuneration being regularly 
addressed. The ARC met six times with sustainability-related matters 
regularly addressed. After each meeting, committee chairs provide 
updates to the Board.
The Board and EC consider sustainability matters on an integrated 
basis when overseeing strategy, decisions on major investments and 
risk management. Trade-offs and stakeholder interests are considered 
as part of this process.
See "Supporting governance committees" on page 128 and "Principal 
decisions and stakeholders" on pages 145-148 for examples of how 
sustainability matters are integrated into decision-making and risk 
management processes.
See "Board activities" on page 161-164 for information about the nature 
of the sustainability matters addressed by the Board in 2024.
As part of the annual planning cycle, the Board and EC assess how 
climate change and GHG emissions may affect the pace of the energy 
transition, business emission reduction plans and the implications for 
Shell's portfolio.
Integration of sustainability-related performance in 
incentive schemes (GOV-3)
Our remuneration schemes are designed to support Shell in achieving 
its corporate strategy. We have established remuneration structures to 
support us in reducing our operational emissions and to support 
customers in reducing their emissions.
The majority of employees participate in the annual bonus scheme. 
Executive Directors and other nominated employees receive long-term 
share awards, which aim to support employee retention and provide a 
stake in Shell's future. 
See "Directors' Remuneration Report" on pages 188-190 for information 
about remuneration schemes linked to sustainability. 
This section includes details of the schemes, including the sustainability-
linked measures and targets and metrics used in the performance 
assessment, the proportion of variable remuneration dependent on 
sustainability-related performance and the role of the Remuneration 
Committee in approving and updating the Directors' Remuneration 
Policy.
See "Linking Shell's emissions targets to remuneration" on page 104 for 
information about how climate-related considerations are factored into 
remuneration for the Executive Directors.
Statement on due diligence (GOV-4)
Due diligence is the process by which companies identify, prevent, 
mitigate and account for how they address the actual and potential 
negative impacts on the environment and people connected with their 
business.
This process is described in the international instruments of the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.

Core elements of due diligence Pages
Risk management and internal controls over 
sustainability reporting (GOV-5)
Shell has established a system of risk management and internal control 
over sustainability reporting in line with the risk management processes 
set out in the Shell Performance Framework, which provides the overall 
framework we use to deliver our strategy and sets out how we manage 
risks in Shell. See "Risk management and risk factors" on pages 134-144 
for more information.
The scope of these internal controls covers preparation of the 
Sustainability Statements as well as the underlying data gathering 
and reporting processes for our environmental, social and 
governance metrics. 
Responsibility for these processes is distributed across several internal 
functions, including Finance, Human Resources, and Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management (SEAM).
We assess the risk of material misstatements based on factors such as 
the maturity and complexity of the reporting process, the potential for 
error, the use of judgements and estimates, and the effectiveness of 
existing controls. Our approach focuses on strengthening data 
gathering and reporting processes, implementing controls and 
assessing effectiveness as part of a continuous improvement cycle.
The main risks identified and their mitigation strategy and controls are shown below.
Sustainability reporting risks, mitigation strategies and controls
Risk Mitigation strategies and controls
Inaccurate or incomplete disclosure of quantitative metrics Further development of a risk-based reporting control framework for sustainability data. Components 
include governance, process documentation, risk identification, and design and embedding of controls 
and assurance activities in reporting processes.
Inaccurate or incomplete disclosure of qualitative information Multi-layered review and sign-off of qualitative disclosures by subject matter experts and accountable 
senior managers.
Non-compliance with regulatory requirements due to lack of 
clarity on regulatory interpretation and/or application of 
accounting and reporting policies
Establishment of a cross-functional team to interpret and apply sustainability accounting and reporting 
policies on a consistent basis, informed by external engagement with regulators and third parties.
Inconsistency with other disclosures Use of incorporation by reference with other sections of the Annual Report and Accounts and 
development of a reporting control framework for disclosures on sustainability matters that occur 
outside the Annual Report and Accounts.
To ensure our system of risk management and internal control is 
integrated into relevant internal processes, management committees 
have been established with representatives of our Finance function and 
other functional process owners to oversee implementation of the 
reporting control framework.
The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) reviews and monitors the 
effectiveness of Shell's system of risk management and internal control. 
The ARC receives regular reports from management and the external 
auditor on sustainability reporting, accounting and reporting policies, 
use of judgements and estimates, and other reporting matters. Internal 
control practices related to sustainability reporting are being 
strengthened further. The "Plan-Do-Check-Adjust" approach set out in 
the Shell Performance Framework has been, and will continue to be, 
used as our reporting control framework develops.
Control incidents and audit findings, both internal and external, are 
subject to a monitoring and remediation process overseen by senior 
management and supported by functional experts as required. 
The findings of sustainability reporting risk assessments and internal 
controls, including internal and external assurance reviews, are 
communicated to the ARC and members of the Executive Committee 
as required.
The External Reporting Control Committee assists the Executive 
Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee in fulfilling their 
responsibilities in relation to internal control over external reporting 
as it pertains to financial reporting and environmental, social and 
governance reporting in the Annual Report and Accounts and 
quarterly results announcements.

External assurance of sustainability information
In addition to the statutory audit of the financial statements, limited 
assurance is performed for the Sustainability Statements by Shell's 
independent auditor. See "The Independent Auditor's Report related 
to the Sustainability Statements" on page 438.
Our sustainability performance data are not subject to additional 
validation at a Group level by an external body.
Strategy, business model and value chain (SBM-1)

More value 
We are committed to enhancing value for our investors through 
disciplined investments, enhanced shareholder distributions and 
maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our focus remains on providing 
secure and reliable products, both now and throughout the energy 
transition, to meet the evolving needs of our customers. At Capital 
Markets Day 2023 (CMD23), we outlined our specific targets, and the 
progress we have made against these targets is presented on page 14.
Less emissions
We are committed to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business 
by 2050. We have set climate targets and an ambition, outlined in our 
Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24), to help us reach net zero. 
ETS24 was approved by 78% of shareholders who voted at our Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) in May. Progress against our climate targets 
and ambition is presented on page 93.

---- Page 351 ----
Shell aims to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive 
strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory 
support from governments. We will continue to provide our customers 
with the energy and other products they need, and we will provide this 
affordably and reliably, while also increasingly offering them low-
carbon energy solutions to help them decarbonise their activities.
Moving forward
In 2024, we delivered our strategy against the four themes of 
generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, respecting 
nature and powering lives. These themes are presented on pages 12-13.
Like all businesses, we will continue to adapt how we implement our 
strategy as the world evolves. This adaptability is crucial for navigating 
the dynamic energy landscape enabling long-term success. 
Capital Markets Day on March 25, 2025, presents an update to our 
financial targets for investors. See pages 16-17.
We will deliver more value with less emissions by:
￮ Growing our integrated gas and LNG business
￮ Sustaining liquids production 
￮ Focusing Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. 
Growing our integrated gas and LNG business
We are investing in our gas production and growing our LNG business 
to deliver the secure energy the world needs. LNG is a critical fuel for 
the energy transition because it is a lower-carbon alternative to coal in 
power generation and can be easily transported to where it is needed. 
Sustaining liquids production 
We aim to sustain liquids production of at least 1.4 million barrels a 
day through to 2030 with increasingly lower carbon intensity. We are 
focusing our exploration activities in locations where hydrocarbons 
have already been discovered.
Focusing Downstream, Renewables 
and Energy Solutions
We are expanding our premium marketing businesses while 
streamlining our portfolio with a focus on value over volume. We will 
build on the options we have invested in for low-carbon growth through 
the energy transition. Our global customer reach and our supply and 
trading capabilities position us well to deliver the low-carbon solutions 
people and businesses need.
We are seeking to change the mix of energy products we sell to our 
customers as their needs for energy change. We believe we can make 
the greatest contribution to the energy transition by helping to enable 
our customers to switch to low-carbon energy products and services.
 
This is reflected in Shell's strategy to build a portfolio that seeks to:
￮develop low- and zero-carbon alternatives to traditional fuel, 
including biofuels, and other low- and zero-carbon gases;
￮ provide more renewable power solutions to customers in select 
markets;
￮ work with customers across different sectors to help them 
decarbonise their use of energy, for example by substituting the 
use of coal with LNG; and
￮ address any remaining emissions from conventional fuels with 
solutions such as CCS and high-quality carbon credits.
As we implement our strategy, we will continue to focus on performance, 
discipline and simplification. This applies not only to our financial and 
operational outcomes, but also to safety and sustainability. Our Goal 
Zero ambition is fundamental to the success of our company. 
We believe that no business can succeed without an unwavering 
commitment to respecting the environment and the communities within 
which it works. At Shell, we seek to protect the environment, increase 
our reuse and recycling, make a positive contribution to biodiversity 
and use water and other resources efficiently. We also work to make 
a positive impact on people around the world, and power lives through 
our products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.
See "Our strategy" on pages 10-13 for more information.
Sustainability in our strategy
We believe that no business can succeed without an unwavering 
commitment to respecting the environment and the communities within 
which it works. In addition to generating shareholder value, our 
strategy is built on achieving net-zero emissions, powering lives and 
respecting nature. For each, we discuss key challenges and how we 
are responding in the relevant topical ESRS.
￮ Achieving net-zero emissions: We have a target to become a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050 and will work with customers to 
help them decarbonise. See "Climate change (E1)" on page 364.
￮ Powering lives: We power lives through our products and activities, 
and by supporting an inclusive society. See "Own workforce (S1)" on 
page 409, "Workers in the value chain (S2)" on page 414 and 
"Affected communities (S3)" on page 419.
￮ Respecting nature: We seek to protect the environment, increase our 
reuse and recycling, make a positive contribution to biodiversity and 
use water and other resources efficiently.See "Pollution (E2)" on 
page 391, "Water and marine resources (E3)" on page 395, 
"Biodiversity and ecosystems (E4)" on page 397 and "Resource 
use and circular economy (E5)" on page 404.
Our strategy is underpinned by our core values of honesty, integrity 
and respect for people; our culture of performance, discipline and 
simplification; and our Goal Zero ambition to do no harm to people 
and to have no leaks across our operations. 
See "Business conduct (G1)" on page 425 and "Safety" on page 429 
for more information.
How we create value
For more than a century, Shell has connected people and energy. We 
provide the energy people need to fuel their homes, hospitals, schools, 
vehicles, machinery and factories. Our purpose is to power progress 
together, by working with each other, our customers and our partners. 
Our vision [B] is to be the world's leading integrated energy company -- 
delivering impact at scale, connecting energy and people, matching 
supply to demand. 
[B] A vision statement defines the desired future state of a company rather than a series 
of firm, binding commitments.
Our value creation process shows how we link our inputs to our strategic 
objectives. Our inputs include financial capital, operations, human capital, 
relationships, intellectual capital and natural resources. We gather, 
develop and secure these inputs through our business relationships with 
investors, strategic partners and suppliers, and governments. 
Through our production, processing, trading, sales and distribution 
activities, we transform our inputs into energy and non-energy products 
that benefit our customers by offering more low-carbon solutions to 
meet their needs in a world on its way to net zero. These activities 
depend on employees, suppliers, value chain workers and communities, 
as well as other stakeholders. 
Our outcomes are generating value for shareholders and transforming 
Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, while 
powering lives and respecting nature.Our upstream value chain 
consists of direct and indirect suppliers of goods and services which

form an input to our products. Examples include suppliers of 
hydrocarbons, biofuels and biomass, power, non-fuel products sold in 
our retail sites and a wide variety of goods and services procured for 
use in our projects and operations, such as engineering, construction 
and maintenance services and materials.
Our downstream value chain consists of customers and their use of 
our sold products. Examples include retail customers who consume oil 
products, biofuels, non-fuel retail products or electric vehicle charging 
solutions. Other examples include business customers who consume 
natural gas, crude oil or oil products, as well as customers who 
consume non-energy products such as chemicals. 
References to "upstream value chain" and "downstream value chain" in 
the Sustainability Statements have the meaning given above and do 
not refer to our Upstream business segment or to our Downstream,

Interests and views of stakeholders (SBM-2)
Shell recognises the important role it has in many societies and is 
committed to public collaboration and stakeholder engagement. 
Working with stakeholders is crucial to drive the collaboration needed 
between governments, companies and consumers to advance the 
energy transition. 
Shell's key stakeholders can be categorised into seven groups. 
Where appropriate, each group is considered to include both current 
and potential stakeholders. We seek to understand the needs and 
expectations of key stakeholder groups and take their views and 
interests into account in our decision-making.

Stakeholder engagement is governed by the Shell General Business 
Principles (SGBP), which set out how we recognise our responsibilities 
to stakeholders. They set the standard for how we engage, guided 
by the principles of listening, respect and honesty.
Stakeholder engagement is a continuous process of dialogue. Our 
business engages with key stakeholder groups on a regular basis 
at multiple levels. We may undertake more frequent or structured 
engagement during projects, activities, acquisitions, divestments and 
other significant decisions. Stakeholder engagement is fundamental 
to how we identify, assess and manage actual and potential impacts 
associated with our business. It is also an integral part of how we 
respect human rights and provide access to remedy. 
Shell's strategy and business model are informed by the views, interests 
and rights of key stakeholder groups, including customers, investors, 
employees, strategic partners and suppliers, affected communities, civil 
society and governments. Value chain workers are a key stakeholder 
group for our strategic partners and suppliers. Our success in the 
energy transition depends on our people, our contractors and 
suppliers, and the communities in which we operate. 
We recognise there are differing societal views about our operations 
and the intricacies associated with the evolving energy transition. 
These differences are also reflected in our key stakeholder groups. 
Management weighs up all relevant factors and considers which 
course of action best enables delivery of our strategy in the long-term 
interests of the Company, taking into consideration the effect on 
stakeholders. It is not always possible to balance the Company's 
interests with those of other stakeholders.
See "Principal decisions and stakeholders" on pages 145-148 for 
information on how the interests of stakeholders are taken into account 
in the Board's decision-making process. See "Our approach to 
sustainability" on pages 127-133, "Understanding and engaging with 
our stakeholders" on pages 165-166 and "Workforce engagement" 
on pages 167-168 for information about how the Board and EC are 
informed about the views and interests of affected stakeholders with 
regard to sustainability-related impacts.
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (SBM-3)
Shell has conducted an assessment of its material sustainability-related 
impacts, risks and opportunities as the basis for determining its 
disclosures in the Sustainability Statements in 2024.
Within the Sustainability Statements, the term "impacts" refers to 
actual and potential sustainability-related impacts on people and the 
environment connected with our business. Such impacts can be positive 
or negative. "Risks and opportunities" refers to sustainability-related 
financial risks and opportunities, including those derived from 
dependencies on natural, human and social resources.
When the terms impact, risk and opportunity are used within the 
Sustainability Statements, they generally have the meaning given 
to them by the ESRS unless the context indicates otherwise. 
Our assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities is based on the 
double materiality principle. This requires us to consider sustainability 
matters from the perspective of Shell's actual or potential impact on the 
environment and society, as well as whether such matters trigger or 
could reasonably be expected to trigger material financial effects for 
Shell. These perspectives are sometimes referred to as "impact 
materiality" and "financial materiality". A matter is material for 
reporting purposes if it meets the criteria for impact materiality, 
financial materiality or both.
Impacts
We consider actual and potential impacts over the short, medium and 
long term. Impacts include those connected with our own operations, 
our value chain and business relationships. We have the ability to 
control Shell companies and Shell-operated joint ventures by applying 
our own policies and standards. Shell does not control non-operated 
joint ventures. 
Our influence over value chain and business relationships is indirect, 
depending on factors such as our line of sight into potential impacts 
and the nature of our contractual rights and obligations, if any.
Risks and opportunities
We consider risks or opportunities that could have a material effect 
on Shell's earnings, cash flows and financial condition over the short, 
medium or long term.
Outcome
Our double materiality assessment has identified 23 material impacts. 
Sixteen were assessed as negative and seven as positive. One of the 
negative impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, corresponds to both a risk 
and an opportunity (see "Climate change and the energy transition" on 
page 137 and "Climate related opportunities" on page 84 
respectively). The remaining impacts do not constitute a risk or 
opportunity in their own right, although many are considered an 
element of a larger principal risk factor. 
Our impacts, risks and opportunities are summarised in the table 
"Material sustainability topics" on pages 352-353. We indicate the 
reasonably expected time horizon in which effects could materialise. 
We also indicate whether impacts, risks or opportunities concentrate 
in our own operations or value chain. 
Information about our approach to managing individual impacts, risks 
and opportunities through policies, actions, metrics and targets can be 
found in the topical sections. 
For further topic-specific information, see "Material impacts, risks and 
opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model 
(ESRS 2 SBM-3)" on page 367 for climate change, page 409 for own 
workforce, page 414 for workers in the value chain and page 419 for 
affected communities.
The double materiality assessment process uses qualitative and/or 
quantitative thresholds to determine which impacts, risks and 
opportunities are identified and addressed by Shell as material and 
to determine which sustainability matters are material for reporting 
purposes. Therefore, the Sustainability Statements may not include 
every impact, risk and opportunity or additional entity-specific 
disclosure that each individual key stakeholder group may consider 
important in its own particular assessment.

We assessed seven of the eight topical standards of the ESRS as 
material for Shell in 2024, with some individual subtopics, sub-
subtopics or data points assessed as non-material. The eighth standard, 
"S4 Consumers and end-users", was assessed as non-material. The 
topics of most relevance to customers, Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions and product stewardship, are covered in "Climate change 
(E1)" on pages 364-376 and "Pollution (E2)" on pages 391-394, 
respectively.
Current and anticipated effects on business model, value 
chain, strategy and decision-making
The "Risk factors" section on pages 135-144 provides an overview of 
the principal risks Shell is exposed to in its operations, their potential 
effects and how they are managed.
Our double materiality assessment has identified GHG emissions as 
a material impact and climate change and energy transition as a 
sustainability-related risk. The current and anticipated effects of this risk 
on our business model, value chain, strategy and decision-making are 
described in "Our strategy" on pages 10-13, "Risk factors" on pages 
135-144 and "Our journey to net zero" on pages 76-108. 
The remaining impacts are not a material risk or opportunity for Shell 
in their own right. However, many are considered elements of one or 
more risk factors. The current and anticipated effects of these impacts 
on our business model, value chain, strategy and decision-making are 
described in "Our strategy" on pages 10-13, "Risk factors" on pages 
135-144, and alongside the disclosures provided under the 
corresponding topical ESRS.
Current and anticipated financial effects
See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 
255-265 for information about financial effects as well as other 
key insights, including sensitivities related to climate change and 
the energy transition.
Resilience of strategy and business model
See "Resilience of Shell's strategy to different climate-related scenarios" 
on pages 86-88 for information about the resilience of our strategy and 
business model in the context of climate change and the energy 
transition.
The resilience of our strategy and business model in the context of 
material impacts that are elements of one or more risk factors is 
described in "Our strategy" on pages 10-13, "Risk factors" on pages 
135-144, and alongside the disclosures provided under the 
corresponding topical ESRS.
Changes compared to previous periods
The current reporting period is the first in which Shell has conducted a 
double materiality assessment in accordance with ESRS requirements. 
Accordingly, there are no changes to our material impacts, risks or 
opportunities compared to the previous reporting period. 
Description of the process to identify and assess material 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)
Shell has developed a process to identify and assess material 
sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities as the basis 
for determining our disclosures in the Sustainability Statements. 
Our double materiality process follows five steps. We start by 
establishing our business context, activities, value chain and 
stakeholders. Next, we consider potential sustainability matters and 
identify actual and potential impacts, risks and opportunities. We 
then assess impacts for actual and potential severity, and risks and 
opportunities for potential financial effects. Finally, we determine 
material matters for reporting. Each step is discussed below.
1. Establish the business context
We begin by establishing the scope of the assessment. To provide 
a common framework for analysis, we review our principal activities, 
business relationships and key stakeholder groups. We consider Shell's 
dependence on key resources including financial capital, operations, 
human capital, relationships, intellectual capital and natural resources. 
We also adopt guidelines for assessing our own operations and our 
upstream and downstream value chain.
2. Identify impacts, risks and opportunities
Next, we review the list of sustainability-related topics, subtopics 
and sub-subtopics provided by the ESRS and industry-specific lists 
developed by Ipieca and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 
Where relevant, we also consider Shell-specific topics.
Based on this review, internal experts prepare an inventory of impacts, 
risks and opportunities. When performing this exercise for our own 
operations, we are informed by various sources of information, such as 
operating data, internal and external studies, and stakeholder views. 
For our upstream and downstream value chain, we focus on areas 
where there is sufficient information to allow us to make an informed 
assessment. This may include our own operating data or information 
provided by suppliers, business partners or other third parties.
We focus our assessment on aspects of our own operations with the 
most potential for negative impacts on people or the environment 
based on industry experience. We also focus on business relationships 
with high potential for negative impacts, such as non-operated 
ventures, governments and suppliers
We consider actual and potential impacts, both positive and negative. 
For risks and opportunities, we consider uncertain environmental, social 
or governance events or conditions that, if they occurred, could have 
material financial effects on Shell. Impacts, risks and opportunities are 
considered over the short, medium and long term.
3. Assess actual and potential impacts
We adopt criteria to assess the likelihood and magnitude of impacts. 
These criteria are based on Shell's existing risk assessment tools for 
health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & 
SP), modified where necessary to meet the requirements of the ESRS.
Our assessment matrix is based on a five-point scale for likelihood. 
Magnitude is also based on a five-point scale, taking into account the 
scale, scope and remediability of the impact. 
For actual impacts, we treat the effect as already occurring and do not 
assign a rating for likelihood. We assign a rating for magnitude based 
on actual impacts after implementation of standard control measures. 
We exclude from this analysis measures that compensate for residual 
impacts, such as the use of carbon credits or biodiversity offsets. 
For potential impacts, we assign a rating for likelihood and magnitude. 
In line with ESRS requirements, we assess potential magnitude on a 
gross basis, assuming no mitigation in consequences due to control 
measures. For potential human rights impacts, magnitude takes 
precedence over likelihood.
4. Assess risks and opportunities
We adopt criteria to assess the likelihood and magnitude of potential 
financial effects. These are based on our existing enterprise risk 
management framework, modified where necessary to ensure 
consistency with our approach to assessing impacts. Our assessment 
matrix is based on a five-point scale for likelihood. Magnitude is also 
based on a five-point scale, taking into account the potential ways in 
which financial effects could materialise, including through Shell's 
dependence on natural, human and social resources.
Sustainability Statements | ESRS2 General continued
354 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 357 ----
To ensure connectivity with existing disclosures, we consider whether 
potential risks have been identified previously as a principal risk factor 
or as an element of a principal risk factor. Where applicable, these 
linkages are highlighted in our disclosure. See "Risk management and 
risk factors" on pages 134-144 for information about how sustainability 
matters are integrated with our risk factors.
5. Determine material disclosures
In the final step of the process, we apply the outcome of the double 
materiality assessment to determine our material disclosures for the 
Sustainability Statements. A consolidated list of impacts, risks and 
opportunities is reviewed with internal experts and managers. 
Reporting thresholds for actual impacts are based on magnitude. For 
potential impacts, reporting thresholds are based on a combination of 
likelihood and magnitude. For risks that are material on a stand-alone 
basis, reporting thresholds follow existing definitions of financial 
materiality. Opportunities are assessed based on qualitative thresholds. 
The final results of the assessment are reviewed and endorsed by an 
internal management committee consisting of senior business and 
functional managers. See "Risk management and internal controls over 
sustainability reporting (GOV-5)" on page 347 for information about 
control procedures for sustainability reporting.
We map our material impacts, risks and opportunities to ESRS 
disclosure requirements. Disclosure requirements with at least one 
corresponding impact, risk or opportunity are deemed to be material. 
The remainder are deemed to be non-material. We omit individual data 
points deemed to be non-material based on the process for determining 
data point materiality laid out in the ESRS. This process takes into 
consideration the significance of the information in relation to the 
matter it purports to explain or depict and the relevance of the data 
point to meeting the decision-making needs of users.
How our management systems inform the assessment 
Sustainability is integrated into our existing risk management 
processes, as set out in the Shell Performance Framework. Our double 
materiality assessment, undertaken for the purpose of determining our 
disclosures in the Sustainability Statements, is informed by these 
processes but does not replace them.
Details of how existing risk management processes inform our 
assessment of specific topics are set out below. See "How we manage 
risks" on page 134 and "Policies and standards" on page 130 for 
information about how sustainability is integrated into Shell's overall 
approach to risk management.
HSSE & SP and Asset Management
Our standards require a systematic approach to managing health, 
safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP). 
The foundation of this approach is our management system.
Our approach to identifying and assessing impacts, risks and 
opportunities related to emissions, pollution, water, biodiversity, 
circularity and waste and affected communities is governed by our 
internal risk management process and our SEAM Standards. We 
expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate and 
acceptable policies to manage their risks.
We use various processes to identify, assess and manage health, 
safety, environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities. 
Two of the most important are impact assessment and the hazards 
and effects management process.
Impact assessment
Our standards require projects, assets or businesses to identify the 
need for an impact assessment process in the early stages of a project 
with the potential for new or changed impacts on the environment, 
communities and community health. Impact assessment is a 
methodology to identify and assess the environmental, social and 
health impacts of a proposed project. It involves evaluating alternatives 
and identifying measures to mitigate negative impacts or enhance 
positive impacts, as well as management and monitoring 
arrangements. Our standards require the impact assessment to be 
performed in alignment with international standards, which are 
generally defined as local legal requirements in high-income OECD 
countries at a minimum and the IFC Performance Standards elsewhere.
Hazards and effects management
Our standards require assets, projects and activities to establish and 
maintain systematic risk identification and management processes such 
as the hazards and effects management process (HEMP). This approach 
starts by identifying potential hazards and evaluating their likelihood and 
potential impact. We then implement controls to reduce the risks to as low 
as reasonably practicable (ALARP), which is the point at which the cost in 
time, money and effort of further risk reduction is grossly disproportionate 
to the reduction achieved. In doing so, we apply a hierarchy of controls, 
which prioritises the elimination, substitution and isolation of hazards, 
before implementing engineered safeguards or other solutions. We 
monitor the effectiveness of these controls via regular assurance activities.
Community engagement
We engage with affected communities on a range of topics related to 
our operations, including issues related to pollution, water, biodiversity 
and waste. In some locations, permitting processes may also require 
statutory public consultations or hearings. See "Affected Communities

on page 350 for information.
How our approach to individual topics inform the 
assessment
The application of our management systems with respect to individual 
environmental, social and governance topics is explained below.
Climate change
Our approach to identifying and assessing climate-related impacts, 
risks and opportunities is integrated into the risk management, 
performance management, learning and improvement cycle that 
sits at the heart of the Shell Performance Framework.
Climate-related matters are considered from a strategic, operational, 
conduct and culture perspective to help us maintain a comprehensive 
view of our impacts, risks and opportunities and the time horizons in 
which they could materialise. 
GHG emissions
We identify, assess and manage actual and potential GHG emissions 
from activities under our operational control as part of our SEAM 
Standards. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt 
appropriate and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
We identify sources of Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions based on 
operating data, design and engineering practices, and analysis of 
products manufactured and sold. We assess the actual and potential 
GHG emissions inventory from these sources in line with internationally 
recognised standards and industry-specific guidelines [A].
[A] Assessments of GHG emissions associated with our business activities are prepared in 
accordance with ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with Guidance at the Organization Level 
for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals and the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004). Industry-specific 
guidance is also applied, including the API Compendium of Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Methodologies for the Natural Gas and Oil Industry (November 2021), Ipieca 
Sustainability Reporting Guidance for the Oil and Gas Industry (4th edition, 2020) and 
other standards and guidance.

Our standards require assets and projects to forecast their future 
emission levels and to prepare an annual plan which demonstrates 
planned delivery of their allotment of business-level carbon targets. The 
aim of this requirement is to ensure that assets or projects with material 
GHG emissions have plans to contribute emission reductions in line 
with Shell's GHG reduction targets and ambition.
Each business and function regularly reviews its risk profile, risk 
responses and assurance activities throughout the year to ensure 
climate-related risks are managed effectively. These insights are used to 
provide management with updates on the operational management of 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks and opportunities. 
During these updates, management reviews whether our risk responses 
are effective in addressing the components of climate-related risks and 
opportunities. These reviews help us to update Shell's plans and guide 
our day-to-day operational decisions such as maintenance schedules 
and our risk response plans. See "Material impacts, risks and 
opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model 
(ESRS 2 SBM-3)" on page 351.
The management teams are supported by a combination of carbon-
management-related standards and frameworks, forums at various 
levels of the organisation, and capability development programmes. 
We use risk management processes to identify and respond to 
emerging risks to the safe, compliant and efficient operation of our 
assets, including climate-related risk. 
Our risk management processes are carried out at the Group, business, 
function and asset level, which includes projects.
Climate-related physical risks
See "Physical risks" on page 83 for information on Shell's approach 
to identifying and assessing climate-related physical hazards in our 
operations and value chain, our use of high-emission climate scenarios, 
and our exposure to climate-related physical risk.
Climate-related transition risks and opportunities
We monitor climate-related transition risks across four components: 
commercial, regulatory, societal (including litigation) and physical, as 
well as monitoring climate-related opportunities. We are continually 
enhancing our approach to identifying, assessing and managing risks 
and opportunities resulting from climate change. This includes 
considering different time horizons in which risks and opportunities 
could materialise and their relevance for business planning. 
Shell has identified climate change and the energy transition as a 
material risk. The risk could potentially result in changes to the demand 
for our products, supply chains and markets; further changes to the 
regulatory environment in which we operate; and increased litigation. 
See Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements "Legal 
proceedings and other contingencies" on page 308.
In assessing this risk, we have considered a range of climate scenarios 
including those in which the rise in global average temperature this 
century is limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
We actively monitor societal developments such as regulation-driven 
carbon pricing and customer-driven product preferences. Where 
relevant, we incorporate these developments into potential scenarios 
which provide insights into how the energy transition may unfold in the 
medium and long term. These insights, along with those provided by 
external scenarios such as those prepared for the IPCC's Sixth 
Assessment Report, guide how we set our strategic direction, capital 
allocation and climate-related targets and ambition.
The transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will 
require simultaneous action in three areas: an unprecedented 
improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used; a sharp 
reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix; and the mitigation 
of residual emissions through the use of technology and natural sinks. 
While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will 
deliver the net-zero goal, scenarios help us to consider the variables 
and the potential direction and pace of the transition needed. 
Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or 
outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for Shell's operating plans, 
outlook and financial statements.
Key aspects of Shell's financial resilience in the context of climate-
related impacts are assessed and described in more detail in Note 4 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 255-265. This 
describes how Shell has considered climate-related impacts in key 
areas of the financial statements and how this translates into the 
valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities. Shell's financial 
statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic 
conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future.
As there is no single scenario that underpins our plans, sensitivity 
analysis has been conducted using a range of key assumptions to test 
the resilience of our asset base. 
Oil and gas prices are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's 
financial statements, with the mid-price outlook informed by Shell's 
scenario planning representing management's best estimate. Price 
outlooks reflect a broad range of factors, including, but not limited to, 
future supply and demand, and the pace of growth of low-carbon 
solutions. The scenarios have been selected to illustrate the resilience of 
the asset base under a range of possible outcomes, including the price 
implications arising from the ambitious International Energy Agency's 
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE50) which provides a 
potential path for the global energy system to net-zero emissions by 
2050. Sensitivities of asset-carrying amounts to prices are under the 
assumption that all other factors in the models used to calculate 
impacts remain unchanged. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed using price outlooks from:
1. Average prices from three 1.5–2°C external climate change 
scenarios.
2. Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: for this, Shell's mid-price outlook is 
applied for the next 10 years. Because of greater uncertainty, the IEA 
normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied for the period after 
10 years. This gives less weight to the price–risk uncertainty in the 
first 10 years reflected in the business plan period and applies more 
risk to the more uncertain subsequent periods. 
3. A 1.5°C scenario, derived from IEA NZE50: this applies the IEA 
normative Net Zero Emissions scenario over the whole period under 
review and reflects the sensitivity to a pure net-zero emissions 
scenario from the IEA. 
Pollution
We maintain an overview of sites and activities under our operational 
control for pollution-related impacts, risks and opportunities. Our 
assessment is based on operating data, technical studies, expert 
analysis and internal risk management processes. We are limited in 
our ability to analyse pollution-related impacts in our upstream and 
downstream value chain owing to limited availability of data.

356 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 359 ----
Water and marine resources
We maintain an overview of sites and activities under our operational 
control for water-related impacts, risks and opportunities. Our 
assessment is based on operating data, technical studies, expert 
analysis and internal risk management processes. We also use tools 
such as the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. 
We are limited in our ability to analyse water-related impacts in our 
upstream and downstream value chain owing to the limited availability 
of data.
Biodiversity and ecosystems
In addition to our requirements for impact assessment, where the 
significance of potential impacts is assessed using criteria tailored to 
local environmental and socio-economic circumstances, our standards 
also require us to avoid adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem 
services and, where avoidance cannot be achieved, to mitigate 
adverse impacts via the mitigation hierarchy.
We use a variety of internationally recognised assessment tools, such 
as the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), to guide our 
approach to identifying impacts, risks and opportunities, in combination 
with analysis of site-level data. 
Where we have sites located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas, 
we implement measures to avoid, minimise, restore or, if necessary, 
compensate for negative impacts on natural habitats or the habitats 
of species for which a protected area has been designated. If a site is 
located in critical habitat, our standards require us to implement the 
mitigation hierarchy and achieve net positive impact on biodiversity. 
We follow national or international standards to assess biodiversity 
impacts and define mitigation measures.
We consult with local communities and other affected stakeholders 
throughout the project life cycle on potential impacts of our activities on 
the biological resources, ecosystems and ecosystem services used by 
them and ways to avoid or minimise such impacts.
We have further work to do to identify and assess dependencies at site 
locations and in the upstream and downstream value chain. We also 
have further work to do to identify and assess transition and physical 
risks and systemic risks. We aim to undertake further work to mature 
our understanding of these topics.
We are limited in our ability to analyse biodiversity-related impacts 
in our upstream and downstream value chain owing to the limited 
availability of data at Group level.
Resource use and circular economy
We maintain an overview of sites and activities under our operational 
control for circularity-related impacts, risks and opportunities. Our 
assessment is based on operating data, technical studies, expert 
analysis and internal risk management processes. We are limited in 
our ability to analyse circularity-related impacts in our upstream and 
downstream value chain owing to the limited availability of data.
Own workforce
We identify actual or potential impacts on our workforce through a 
variety of means. These include feedback from human resources and 
line managers, feedback from engagement and the Shell People 
Survey, learning from Shell Global Helpline cases and other 
mechanisms. We identify, assess and manage safety-related risks for 
activities under our operational control as part of our SEAM Standards. 
Workers in the value chain
We identify, assess and manage worker welfare-related impacts for 
activities under our operational control as part of our SEAM Standards. 
We identify, assess and manage impacts for people who work in our 
supply chain for non-hydrocarbon goods and services as part of our 
enhanced value chain due diligence process. 
Affected communities
We identify, assess and manage community-related impacts for 
activities under our operational control as part of our SEAM Standards. 
In addition, we conduct a risk-based annual review of select assets and 
projects to evaluate the effectiveness of local management of social 
performance, with participation from in-country teams and central 
experts. 
Ethics and compliance
Shell's Ethics and Compliance Office (SECO) establishes requirements 
for Shell's businesses and functions, and supports them to identify and 
assess ethics and compliance risks. SECO designs, supports and 
monitors Shell's ethics and compliance programmes. These are 
supported by legal counsel who monitor external legal and regulatory 
developments. Shell's businesses and functions are responsible for 
implementing the necessary policies, standards and procedures. Ethics 
and compliance representatives provide advice and monitor the 
effectiveness of the programme. 
Our ethics and compliance policies require Shell's businesses and 
functions to review the risks associated with anti-bribery and corruption, 
anti-money laundering, facilitation of tax evasion, data privacy and 
trade compliance, periodically and when there is a significant change 
in business conditions. Many factors influence our exposure to business 
conduct risks. Shell reviews the exposure of its businesses and functions 
based on a variety of factors including the location, the nature of the 
activity and the degree of involvement with government officials.
Other methodological notes
We engage with stakeholders on a regular basis concerning our 
potential business impacts. We have not engaged with stakeholders 
directly on the double materiality assessment, but use feedback from 
existing communication channels to inform our assessment. We 
reviewed the double materiality assessment with relationship owners 
for key stakeholder groups to ensure external views are reflected.
Shell's Sustainability Report 2023 was informed by the double 
materiality principle as set out in the GRI standard and guided by 
topics set out in the GRI and Ipieca standards. This is the first year in 
which we have applied the process prescribed by the ESRS. We expect 
to review our double materiality assessment on an annual basis.

We aim to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 
and work with our customers across sectors to help accelerate the 
energy transition.
Our double materiality assessment has identified GHG emissions as a 
material topic. See "Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (SBM-3)" on page 351 
and "Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, 
risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
The world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains 
secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable 
low-carbon solutions. We believe our strategy supports a balanced 
transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while 
helping to build the energy system of the future. 
Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)
Shell's climate change transition plans are delivered through our strategy. 
This is supported by a suite of processes and greenhouse gas emission 
reduction targets and by an ambition, which cover all of our businesses. 
Our strategy incorporates climate change mitigation actions and 
decarbonisation levers with the aim of generating more value with less 
emissions for the benefit of our shareholders, customers and wider society 
as we work to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.
Targets in support of the Paris Agreement [A]
Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which 
is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels. We aim to become a net-zero emissions 
energy business by 2050 and have set targets to reduce our Scope 1 
and 2 emissions and our net carbon intensity (NCI) [B], as well as an 
ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products 
(Scope 3, Category 11). 
Most of Shell's GHG emissions reduction targets predate the CSRD 
and differ from the ESRS boundary and definitions (see "Targets related 
to climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-4)" on page 371 for 
more information). They all support the objective of becoming a net-
zero emissions energy business by 2050 and are an integral part of 
our transition plans. 
Our oil products ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use 
of our oil products by 15–20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 (2021 
baseline) [C], is set on a gross basis. For the different levers of our 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target, see "Climate change 
mitigation actions and decarbonisation levers" on page 365, "Drivers 
of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions change" on page 94 and 
"Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2 target" on page 102. 
In 2024, our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions reflected a 2% 
increase compared to 2023, and a 30% reduction compared to the 
2016 baseline, without the use of voluntary carbon credits, GHG 
removals or avoided emissions.
[A] Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have chosen 
to set interim targets only to 2030.
[B] Shell's NCI is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold 
by Shell. 
[C] In March 2024, we set an ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our 
oil products by 15–20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer 
emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes 
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
Shell's climate-related targets and ambition are set out in the table 
"Climate-related targets and ambition" on page 365. Our targets 
and ambition are forward-looking based on management's current 
expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, 
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, 
performance or events to differ materially from those expressed 
or implied herein. 
We believe our NCI targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal 
of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average 
temperature this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
As there is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's 
decarbonisation targets within the 1.5°C temperature goal of the 
Paris Agreement, we have derived our NCI targets from scenarios 
developed for the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change.
We start with the complete set of 1.5°C scenarios and then exclude 
scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy 
before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for 
each scenario which is comparable to our own NCI. Finally, we 
produce a 1.5°C pathway based on the reductions in emissions 
intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any 
individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the 
energy transition. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets 
demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5°C goal 
of the Paris Agreement. 
For our oil products ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use 
of our oil products by 15–20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3 
Category 11), using the same set of 1.5 °C scenarios developed for the 
Sixth Assessment Report, we determined the changes in oil volumes in 
the energy system. Our reduction percentage is more ambitious than 
the median value of this range and among the more ambitious 
scenarios. We therefore believe it is compatible with limiting global 
warming to 1.5 C in line with the Paris Agreement.
We have set absolute and intensity reduction targets and an ambition 
for the GHG emissions from our own operations and from the products 
we sell over the short, medium and long term to track our performance.
The NCI metric tracks progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity 
of the energy products sold by Shell. The NCI measures emissions 
associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared to a 2016 
baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and 
changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products -- such as biofuels 
and renewable electricity.
Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the NCI of the products we 
sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support 
of governments and policymakers, to create the right conditions for 
change.
Our performance against our disclosed targets and ambition is set 
out in "Metrics used by Shell to assess climate-related risks and 
opportunities in line with our strategy and risk management process" on 
page 94. It includes information on how the targets and ambition are 
monitored and reviewed, the metrics used, whether our progress is in 
line with what we initially planned and an analysis of trends or 
significant changes in our progress towards achieving the targets 
and ambition.

[A] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased routine flaring. 
Our target is therefore met. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[B] On an intensity basis. Methane intensity is measured separately for oil and gas assets with marketed gas [1] (gas, LNG and GTL available for sale) and assets without marketed gas [2] (oil 
and gas assets where gas is reinjected).
[C] Average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products we sell, on an equity boundary, net of carbon credits. Estimated total GHG emissions included in NCI reflect well-to-wheel 
emissions associated with energy products sold by Shell. This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell.
[D] In March 2024, we set an ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15–20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions 
from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.
Climate change mitigation actions and decarbonisation 
levers
Shell's climate mitigation actions and identified decarbonisation levers 
are embedded in our energy transition plans to support the delivery of 
the absolute and intensity reduction targets and ambition that we have 
set for GHG emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) and 
from the products we sell (Scope 3). This covers all our businesses with 
the aim of reducing emissions from our operations and helping our 
customers transition to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. The 
actions we are taking include:
￮reducing the GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 
improving our energy efficiency, deploying renewable electricity, 
and reducing methane emissions in our assets and projects;
￮ growing our LNG business while decarbonising our LNG portfolio 
in two main ways: by growing our portfolio with a lower carbon 
intensity, and continuing to invest in emissions abatement projects 
to reduce both CO₂ and methane emissions;
￮ managing our Integrated Gas and Upstream portfolio to support a 
balanced energy transition by cutting emissions from oil and gas 
production. Oil production is increasingly from our deep-water 
business which, through innovation, produces higher-margin and 
lower-carbon barrels; and 
￮ focusing our businesses in Downstream and Renewables and Energy 
Solutions to offer more low-carbon energy solutions, while reducing 
sales of oil products.
The climate-change mitigation actions we will take and decarbonisation 
levers we will implement to achieve our targets and ambition will 
depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued 
development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. 
We expect that, on a net portfolio basis, reductions, predominantly 
from abatement projects including carbon capture and storage and 
electrification, are expected to outweigh increases in our Scope 1 and 
2 emissions from new investments between 2024 and 2030. Our 
investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will 
increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the NCI of the 
products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected 
in the decarbonisation levers set out below and reflect an expected 
path to meeting our target by 2030. 
The decarbonisation levers and actions planned to achieve our Scope 1 
and 2 GHG emissions reduction target include:
￮making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in low 
carbon intensity projects, decommissioning facilities, divesting assets 
while sustaining our oil production with increasingly lower carbon 
intensity; 
￮ progressing the repurposing of our energy and chemicals parks;
￮ improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
￮ developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for some of our facilities.
If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset 
any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon 
mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.
The decarbonisation levers and actions planned to achieve our net 
carbon intensity target include: 
￮growing our power sales, including those of renewable power; 
￮ reducing sales of oil products;
￮ increasing the proportion of gas and LNG in our hydrocarbon sales; 
￮ increasing sales of low-carbon fuels, such as biofuels;

---- Page 368 ----
￮ developing and deploying more CCS; and 
￮ using high-quality carbon credits, such as nature-based solutions, 
to offset remaining carbon emissions.
In addition we plan to reduce the sales of oil products in line with our 
Scope 3, Category 11 ambition.
We will continue to reassess our decarbonisation levers over time as 
part of our Operating Plan process to support the achievement of our 
targets and ambition. For details of the climate mitigation actions taken 
and decarbonisation levers delivered in 2024 see "Actions and 
resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3)" on page 370, 
"Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2 target" on pages 102 and "GHG 
removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits 
(E1-7)" on page 375.
Investments and funding to support the transition plan
Shell's capital investment and business plans, covering a 10-year cycle, 
include funding to deliver our 2030 targets and ambition which are 
integral to our strategy to achieve net zero by 2050. See "Actions and 
resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3)" on page 370 for 
more information on our investments and funding which support our 
energy transition plans. In addition, see "Capex Plan assessment" on 
page 380 for an explanation of the key performance indicators of EU 
taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (capex) and capex plans, and 
"Investing in the energy transition" on pages 86-90 for details of our 
short-term capex plans in support of our energy transition plan. 
Shell allocates capital through an integrated process that considers our 
aspired portfolio and product mix, hurdle rate (minimum acceptable rate 
of return), emissions impact and other factors, with the aim of taking 
decisions that balance short-, medium- and long-term business objectives. 
Energy transition plan operating expenditure (opex) and capex is 
reported by the main investment categories, such as non-energy products 
and low-carbon energy solutions, as well as by segment. Shell monitors 
and continues to evolve cash capital and operational expenditure by 
segment and by product group to achieve its targets and ambition. 
Potential locked-in GHG emissions
Shell has not identified potential locked-in GHG emissions to be a 
significant transition risk. We believe our decarbonisation plans will 
deliver our GHG emissions reduction targets by 2030.
Shell's business plans, including the impact of our identified 
decarbonisation levers, cover a 10-year forward-looking period. 
Decarbonisation targets are key to our business planning process. 
Shell's Operating Plan process identifies opportunities for Scope 1 and 
2 GHG emission reductions from assets and activities under our 
operational control over the short and medium term which support our 
target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions by 50% by 2030 
compared with the 2016 baseline, on a net basis. 
Additionally, Shell has identified Scope 3, Category 11 "Use of sold 
products" to be a significant category of Scope 3 emissions, along 
with categories 1, 3 and 9. See "Targets related to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation (E1-4)" on page 371 for details of Shell's 
climate-related targets and ambition up to 2030.
Alignment with the EU Taxonomy
Shell prepares its business and financial plans, including its energy 
transition plans, using a broader scope than the EU Taxonomy requires. 
See "The EU Taxonomy" on pages 377-390 for information about 
Shell's taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities.
Shell's reporting on capital expenditure aligns with its business 
segments, which do not correspond to the industry codes contained 
in the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European 
Community (NACE). Under the European Commission's Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, oil and gas production are non-eligible 
activities. Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels is an eligible 
economic activity.
Capex related to coal, oil and gas
Shell is active in the fossil fuel sector and makes significant capital 
expenditures on oil- and gas-related activities.
Shell has assessed its cash capex measure to be the most relevant 
representation of its investment in the oil and gas sector. 
See "Investing in the energy transition" on pages 86-90 for details 
of our investments in the oil and gas sector in 2024.
EU Paris-aligned benchmarks
As Shell derives more than 10% of its total revenues from the 
exploration, extraction, distribution and refining of oil fuels, we are 
excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks, in line with the 
European Commission's Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 
(Climate Benchmark Regulation), Article 12.1(e). 
Transition planning, business strategy and financial 
planning
Shell's energy transition plans are embedded in and aligned with our 
strategy and are supported by our financial planning processes. 
At Group level, the potential impacts of the energy transition on our 
business model and strategy are discussed and assessed by the Board 
and the Executive Committee as part of the annual strategic and 
business planning cycle. This assessment allows us to challenge 
accepted ways of thinking, identify material risks and opportunities, 
and identify key tensions and trade-offs. 
Management consideration of different climate change outcomes 
informs a range of areas, including but not limited to the setting of the 
long-term strategy, business planning, and investment and divestment 
decisions. The outcomes considered by management vary in relation to 
the extent and pace of the energy transition.
We regularly update our business plans, commodity and carbon price 
outlooks, and assumptions as we move towards net-zero emissions by 
2050 [A]. 
[A] We believe our total net absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalent (GtCO2). 
Our strategy reflects our responses to the climate-related risks and 
opportunities identified and energy transition plans developed. Our 
responses can be summarised as: 
￮delivery through our integrated business model; 
￮ decarbonisation of our operations and energy value chains; and
￮ a focus on demand-driven decarbonisation — recognising that we 
need to work with our customers to identify low-carbon energy 
solutions for their energy demands in the sectors where we have 
competitive advantages.
See "Our strategy" on pages 10-13 and "Shell's energy transition plans" 
on pages 77-93 for more information. See "Targets related to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation (E1-4)" on page 371.

Approval of the transition plan
The Board of Directors has primary oversight of the approval and 
delivery of Shell's strategy, including its energy transition plans. 
The Board is supported by the Sustainability Committee (SUSCO), 
the Remuneration Committee (REMCO), the Audit and Risk Committee 
(ARC) and the Nomination and Succession Committee (NOMCO). The 
importance of sustainability means that these committees are informed 
about sustainability, including climate-related matters, as appropriate 
throughout the year. 
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the delegated authority from the 
Board to manage Shell's actions in relation to the Company's strategy. 
The CEO is assisted on climate-related matters by members of the 
Executive Committee to review and implement Shell's energy transition 
plans and ensure that such matters are monitored appropriately. 
See "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over the 
short, medium and long term" on pages 80-84 and "Board oversight of 
sustainability including climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities" 
on pages 127-128.
Progress in implementing the transition plan
Shell's performance and progress in the energy transition is measured 
with respect to our climate-related targets and ambition, including 
those reflected in the remuneration of senior management and 
employees. 
See "Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive 
schemes (GOV-3)" on page 346 and "Metrics used by Shell to assess 
climate-related risks and opportunities in line with our strategy and risk 
management process" on page 94 for more details. 
The targets we have set are used to manage climate-related risks and 
opportunities as well as our performance and are focused primarily on 
reducing our absolute GHG emissions and our NCI. See "Our climate-
related metrics and targets" on page 93 for details of Shell's progress 
in 2024. 
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 
SBM-3)
Shell has identified and assessed the GHG emissions associated 
with our activities to be material, and climate change and the energy 
transition to be a material risk factor. See "Material impacts, risks and 
opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model 
(SBM-3)" on page 351 for more details.
We set out in "Description of the process to identify and assess material 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 our process to 
identify and assess material sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities. We have identified climate-related risks across four 
components: commercial, regulatory and societal (including litigation) 
transition risks, and physical risks. We have also identified climate-
related opportunities as part of our risk assessment.
 Climate-related impacts and risks
Type Description Time horizon
Impacts ￮ Scope 1 — direct GHG emissions from sources under Shell's operational control.
￮ Scope 2 — indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased energy (electricity, steam, 
heating or cooling) consumed by assets under Shell's operational control.
￮ Scope 3 — all other indirect GHG emissions occurring in Shell's upstream and downstream value 
chains, including emissions associated with the use of the energy products we sell.
Short, medium, long
Transition risks
Commercial (CR1) ￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy may lead to lower sales volumes and/or margins due to 
a general reduction or elimination of demand for oil and gas products, possibly resulting in 
underutilised or stranded oil and gas assets, and a failure to secure new opportunities.
￮ Changing preferences of investors and financial institutions could reduce access to and increase 
the cost of capital.
Medium, long
Regulatory (CR2) ￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy will likely increase the cost of compliance for our assets 
and/or products, and may include restrictions on the use of hydrocarbons. The lack of net-zero-
aligned global and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around this risk.
Short, medium, long
Societal (including 
litigation) (CR3)
￮ As societal expectations develop around climate change, there is a potential impact on Shell's 
licence to operate, reputation, brand and competitive position. This is likely to include litigation.
Short, medium, long
Physical risks
Physical risks (CR4) ￮ The potential physical effects of changing climatic conditions could adversely affect our assets, 
operations, supply chains, employees and markets.
Short, medium, long
 Climate-related opportunities
Type Description Time horizon
Opportunities
Opportunities (CO1) ￮ The transition to a low-carbon economy also brings significant opportunities for us to benefit from 
changing customer demands, given our position as a leading global energy provider.

on pages 80-84 and "Metrics used by Shell to assess climate-related 
impacts, risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk 
management process" on pages 93-106.
Current and anticipated effects on business model, value 
chain, strategy and decision-making
In considering climate change, energy transition variables and the 
potential direction and pace of transition, we develop internal climate-
related scenarios and evaluate them together with external scenarios. 
Consideration of different climate-change scenarios informs 
management in a range of areas, including identifying and assessing 
material impacts, risks and opportunities; setting the long-term strategy; 
performing financial and business planning; and taking investment and 
divestment decisions. 
See "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over the 
short, medium and long term" on pages 80-84 and "Impact of climate-
related risks and opportunities on Shell's businesses, strategy and 
financial planning" on pages 85-86 for more information on how Shell 
evaluates the impact of material impacts, risks and opportunities on our 
business model, value chain, strategy and decision-making. 
Current and potential financial effects
A range of current and potential financial effects of climate change 
and the energy transition on Shell's financial statements are outlined in 
Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 255-265.
Note 4 includes sensitivity analysis using various climate-related 
scenarios for oil and gas prices, chemical and refining margins, 
discount rates and carbon prices. Other financial impacts described 
in Note 4 include portfolio changes and asset useful life, product 
demand, decommissioning and restoration, deferred tax assets, 
onerous contracts, dividend resilience and physical risks.
Note 4 describes how Shell has considered climate change in key 
areas of the financial statements and how this translates into the 
valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities. Shell's financial 
statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic 
conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future.
The current financial effects on Shell's financial position, performance 
and cash flows of the material climate-related risks and opportunities 
identified include the likelihood of litigation and increased compliance 
costs. Shell does not consider the identified effects to pose a significant 
risk of material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
within the next annual reporting period. 
Carbon costs in Shell's business plan
Shell's business plan includes capital expenditure and operating costs 
to support the achievement of our Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction 
targets (on a net basis). These include asset-level abatement project 
costs that drive efficiencies and reduce emissions, the expected costs 
of complying with evolving carbon regulations based on a forecast of 
Shell's equity share of emissions and the cost of offsets for any residual 
amounts. Methods for estimating costs vary, depending on the nature 
of the cost.
The total capital expenditure for abatement projects which includes 
energy efficiency improvements, progressing the repurposing of our 
energy and chemicals parks, CCS facilities and electrification of our 
facilities included in the 10-year business plan is in excess of $6 billion. 
Total yearly costs in respect of carbon emissions in Shell's business plan 
gradually increase from $1 billion in 2025 to $5 billion in 2034, using 
our mid-price scenario for carbon costs. Costs for complying with 
evolving carbon regulations are based on a forecast of Shell's equity 
share of emissions and are included in the business plan at Shell's mid-
price outlook on a country-by-country basis and represent 
management's best estimate. 
There is significant uncertainty as to how carbon regulations and costs 
will develop over the next decades. These will depend on policies set 
by countries and the pace of the energy transition. In accordance with 
the International Financial Reporting Standards, Shell's financial 
statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
that represent management's current best estimate of the economic 
conditions that may arise in the foreseeable future, which is policy-
based up to 2030 and then based on the mid-price outlook beyond 
2030.
See "Carbon price sensitivities" in Note 4 on page 260 for more 
information. 
Anticipated financial effects from transition risks and 
potential climate-related opportunities
Shell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable 
assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range 
of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. 
Overall, we mitigate climate-related risks through our strategy to 
deliver more value with less emissions. With our focus on performance, 
discipline and simplification, we believe that we are positioning 
ourselves to achieve our financial targets and climate-related targets 
and ambition. Shell will, through its business and financial planning 
processes, continue to refresh its assessment of the anticipated financial 
impact from the identified material transition and physical risks and 
potential climate-related opportunities.
However, a number of anticipated and potential effects are set out 
in Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 255. 
This note includes an overview of key assumptions used for financial 
planning related to climate change and the energy transition in 
addition to details of the sensitivity of carrying values to commodity 
prices, carbon emission costs, chemical and refining margins, discount 
rates and demand, if different assumptions were applied. 
Resilience of our strategy and business model
See "Resilience of Shell's strategy to different climate-related scenarios" 
on pages 86-90 for information on the resilience of our strategy and 
business model to climate change-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities. See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
on pages 255-265 for information about Shell's financial resilience. 
Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability 
to effectively manage climate-related impacts and risks, capture 
opportunities and reshape our portfolio as the energy system 
transforms. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and 
gas markets. 
As we work towards net-zero emissions, we continue to optimise 
our capital allocation between our business segments. We regularly 
assess the sensitivity of our asset carrying values to carbon pricing, 
discount rates and commodity price assumptions as part of our efforts 
to track the resilience of Shell's strategy to climate-related risks and 
opportunities.

---- Page 371 ----
As there is no single scenario that underpins our plans, sensitivity 
analysis has been conducted using a range of key assumptions to 
test the resilience of our asset base. 
The key areas of climate change-related risks that have been subject 
to sensitivity analysis include:
￮For Integrated Gas and Upstream, sensitivity to commodity prices 
and carbon prices has been tested covering the carrying value of 
goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, 
and joint ventures and associates.
￮ For Chemicals and Products, sensitivity to chemical margins, refining 
margins and carbon prices has been tested. 
￮ Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions (R&ES) are 
expected to be resilient through the energy transition with limited 
exposure of stranded assets.
￮ Sensitivity to changes in the discount rate applied in impairment 
testing has also been tested.
See Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 
255-265.
We believe the areas of uncertainty in our resilience analysis are 
appropriately managed through our energy transition strategy and 
Operating Plan cycle, with relevant mitigating actions considered and 
portfolio changes enacted. In turn, we demonstrate the resilience of our 
business model and strategy as we adapt to changes in technology, 
policy, workforce reskilling requirements and customer preferences. 
The scope of our resilience analysis covers all business areas.
Mitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, 
is considered and embedded in the design, construction and operation 
of our projects and/or operation of our assets. In the long term, the 
level of unpredictability is such that the need for investment in climate 
adaptation measures is not immediate. Our forward planning means 
we are in a position to monitor our assets and determine whether 
there is any need for adaptation action.
Some investors and financial institutions have been aligning their 
portfolios to a low-carbon and net-zero world, driven by both 
regulatory and broader stakeholder pressures. A failure to decarbonise 
in line with investor and lender expectations could have a material 
adverse effect on our ability to access financing for certain types of 
projects. This could also adversely affect our partners' ability to finance 
their portion of costs, either through equity or debt. Shell has looked, 
and continues to look, at sustainable financing options while focusing 
on delivering the Group's energy transition strategy as a whole.
We consider the Group's financial framework to be an appropriate 
one for an oil and gas company navigating the energy transition. 
We believe our approach is increasingly recognised and understood 
by investors and financial institutions.
In preparing our sensitivity analysis, we have used research from 
our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the 
International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn 
from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios which were 
published in 2023. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy 
Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in 
conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or 
outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for Shell's operating plans 
and financial statements.
See "Resilience of Shell's strategy to different climate-related scenarios" 
on pages 86-90 and Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" on pages 255-265.
Policies related to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation (E1-2) 
Policies in place to manage material impacts, risks and 
opportunities related to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation
Shell's policies for managing climate-related matters are based on the 
Shell Performance Framework (SPF). These policies include Shell's 
Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards; our 
Carbon Management Framework; carbon pricing; our Greenhouse 
Gas and Energy Management process, policies and controls; and our 
Opportunity Realisation Standard.
We identify, assess and manage climate-related impacts for activities 
under our operational control as part of our SEAM Standards. 
We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate and 
acceptable policies to manage their risks. See "SEAM Standards" 
on page 130 and "Carbon Management Framework" on page 85 
for information.
Policies on climate change mitigation
Business-level carbon plans
Our policies require our businesses to develop plans that demonstrate 
a decarbonisation trajectory aligned with carbon budgets allocated 
under the Carbon Management Framework. This includes delivery of 
applicable targets related to routine flaring and methane. These 
requirements are designed to ensure that our commitments are 
translated into tangible targets and plans. 
Our policies require our businesses to determine the targets for carbon-
significant and carbon-critical projects, assets and shipping fleets based 
on future CO2 costs, anticipated GHG emissions including those across 
value chains, and in a manner that cumulatively delivers GHG 
performance consistent with our climate-related targets and ambition 
and future aspired portfolio. 
Our policies require businesses to integrate their targets and 
decarbonisation plans into their annual business plans. 
Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management Plan
Our policies require assets and shipping fleets with total annual GHG 
emissions of more than 50,000 tonnes to annually update and assure 
a Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management Plan (GHG EMP) which 
demonstrates planned delivery of their allotment of the business-level 
carbon target. The GHG EMP includes a marginal GHG reduction cost 
curve, economically assessed using applicable CO2 project screening 
values; a minimum 10-year forecast, or forecast to the end of field life 
for upstream assets, of anticipated future emission levels; plans 
demonstrating a trajectory to deliver targets related to flaring and 
methane emissions, where applicable; and a description of risks and 
opportunities in managing and delivering the forecast emissions, 
including energy efficiency levers and deployment of renewable 
energy. See "Internal carbon pricing (E1-8)" on page 376 for more 
details of project screening values. 
Our policies require the outputs of the GHG EMP to be integrated 
in the annual business plan, operating plans and strategic asset 
management plans, as appropriate.
Our policies require the Global Process Council for Greenhouse Gas 
and Energy Management, led by the global process owner for GHG 
and including business and functional experts, to meet regularly to 
evaluate opportunities for the improvement of the processes, tools, 
communications and capabilities needed by the businesses to achieve 
our climate-related targets and ambition.

369 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 372 ----
Tracking of delivery plans
Our policies require our shipping fleets and assets with total annual 
GHG emissions of more than 50,000 tonnes to track delivery of 
planned GHG reductions and to communicate any delay, alteration 
or termination of activities in delivering these reductions to the senior 
executive with single-point accountability for the business concerned.
Integration of GHGs in project evaluation
Our standards require projects to consider GHG emissions in their 
evaluation by including a forecast of annual Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG 
emissions over the life of the project and by applying CO2 project 
screening values in the base economics and net-zero emission 
abatement curve. The aim of this requirement is to ensure that projects 
provide a reasonably accurate outlook of their GHG implications 
to inform robust investment decisions in light of Shell's emission 
reduction commitments.
Carbon Critical and Carbon Significant Projects
Carbon Critical Projects are opportunities (projects and deals) which 
are expected to result in an increase or decrease of 200,000 tonnes 
or more of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent emissions in their peak 
emissions year, or more than 10 terawatt-hours of power delivered in 
their peak generation year. These thresholds apply on a 100% basis for 
Shell-operated ventures or on an equity share basis for non-operated 
ventures. Our standards require Carbon Critical Projects to meet the 
GHG-related requirements of Shell's Opportunity Realisation Standard. 
The aim is to facilitate informed decision-making by identifying potential 
carbon-value trade-offs and carbon-value synergies and contextualising 
these projects in terms of those with the greatest potential to impact our 
ability to meet our GHG reduction commitments.
Carbon Significant Projects refers to projects, assets or modifications 
of existing assets which are expected to result in more than 50,000 
tonnes of CO2e total Scope 1 and 2 emissions in their peak emissions 
year or more than 1 terawatt-hour of power delivered in their 
peak generation year. These thresholds apply on a 100% basis 
for Shell-operated ventures or on an equity share basis for
non-operated ventures.
Our standards require Carbon Critical and Carbon Significant Projects 
to maintain a Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management Plan with 
GHG intensity targets or energy performance targets, or both. The aim 
is to ensure that projects with significant GHG emissions have targets 
benchmarked beyond the minimum requirements in our performance 
standards and plans to bring down GHG emissions over time in line 
with business-level reduction targets. 
For Carbon Critical and Carbon Significant Projects, our standards 
require the Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management Plan to be 
updated at each stage gate of the opportunity realisation process. 
Our standards require the plan to include an abatement curve 
demonstrating the project's approach to achieving net-zero GHG 
emissions; the project's value chain GHG emissions intensity; and a 
description of how carbon competitiveness has been implemented in 
project development through an evaluation of the greenhouse gas 
performance of the concept(s) considered. The aim is to ensure that 
project teams consider carbon as early as possible and to ensure it is 
appropriately considered at each stage gate. 
Our standards also require Carbon Critical and Carbon Significant 
Projects to meet the applicable performance standard(s) and 
implement all value-adding abatement options. The aim is to ensure 
that projects that significantly impact Shell's GHG commitments meet 
a minimum standard of GHG performance, and implement plans to 
further reduce their emissions by leveraging economically feasible 
GHG reduction opportunities.
Our standards require Carbon Critical Projects to receive documented 
endorsement from the senior executive with single-point accountability 
for the relevant business and the technical function head for Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management for the project's greenhouse 
gas and energy management performance target(s) and the project's 
value chain intensity. Our standards require this endorsement at 
each decision gate within the opportunity realisation process and 
for the project mandate proposal to commit to a project and final 
investment proposal.
Policies relevant to climate change adaptation
Mitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, 
is considered and embedded in the design and construction of our 
projects and the operation of our assets to help minimise the risk of 
adverse incidents to our employees and contractors, the environment 
and communities where we operate, and our equipment. Acute and 
chronic physical risks, regardless of cause, are a key consideration in 
our design and engineering practices and standards. 
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant, 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation is supported by members of Shell's Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management function, which includes subject 
matter experts across a broad range of greenhouse gas and carbon 
technical specialisms and other disciplines. The requirements of our 
standards are communicated to people involved with implementation 
through various mechanisms, including internal communication 
channels, management systems and training, as appropriate.
Actions and resources in relation to climate change 
policies (E1-3)
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable. 
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
The key actions we have taken in 2024 have been designed to deliver 
our decarbonisation levers in support of our transition plans.

370 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 373 ----
We are cutting GHG emissions in our operations to meet our 
targets, by:
￮lowering the GHG intensity of our operations through improved 
energy efficiency and reduced combustion, flaring and emissions 
venting;
￮ improving our monitoring of assets to reduce fugitive methane 
emission sources in our operations and by action such as signing 
the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 reporting framework; 
￮ reducing and, in our upstream operations, ultimately eliminating 
routine flaring; 
￮ using more renewable electricity to power our operations; 
￮ developing and deploying carbon capture and storage solutions; 
and
￮ growing our LNG business with lower carbon intensity.
Our Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses 
are aimed at offering more low-carbon solutions by progressing the 
repurposing of our refineries into energy and chemicals parks. As part 
of our approach to the energy transition, we are continuing to develop 
integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the 
products we sell. This includes:
￮developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel 
and renewable natural gas to help our customers decarbonise without 
having to change their cars, trucks, aeroplanes or ships;
￮ becoming a leader in public electric vehicle charging to meet 
growing demand;
￮ making selective investments in renewable power generation, 
batteries and other grid-flexible technologies to decarbonise our 
own operations and provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial 
and industrial customers in our power business; 
￮ continuing to invest in the production of hydrogen as a feedstock for 
synthetic fuels and as an energy carrier for transport and industry to 
expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an 
available and affordable low-carbon option in the future; and
￮ working with governments, customers and partners to unlock the 
potential of carbon capture and storage and carbon removal to 
reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.
Across our businesses, high-quality carbon credits have been and may 
continue to be used by Shell and its customers to compensate for 
emissions in line with the carbon mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce 
and compensate.
We continue to invest in the research and development, demonstration 
and commercial deployment of new technologies and products that 
contribute to decarbonisation. We invest in the latest energy 
technologies through partnerships with start-ups, larger companies 
and leading academic institutions seeking to electrify energy systems, 
decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative 
customer solutions.
See "Drivers of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions change" on page 
94 and "NCI performance" on page 96 for details of the drivers 
of change in 2024 and "Energy transition in action – selection of 
portfolio changes and actions in 2024" on page 92 for details of 
actions taken in 2024. See also "Climate change mitigation actions 
and decarbonisation levers" on page 365 for more information about 
the decarbonisation levers we have identified to achieve our Scope 1 
and 2 GHG emissions reduction target, our NCI target and Scope 3 
Category 11 GHG emissions ambition; and "Progress towards our 
Scope 1 and 2 target" on pages 102-103 and "Progress towards 
our NCI target" on page 103 for details of how we expect our 
decarbonisation levers to progress towards our 2030 targets 
and ambition.
Engagement and advocacy, directly with governments and indirectly 
through industry associations and coalitions, is part of our strategy. 
Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in 
different ways to advocate robust policy, legislation and regulation 
in areas where we can best reduce our own emissions and support 
the decarbonisation of our customers.
We have developed and are advocating positions across the transport 
and industrial sectors, as well as carbon abatement and removal, along 
four key themes:
￮achieving net-zero emissions — cross-sector policies that support 
the achievement of national net-zero commitments through 
comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing;
￮ supplying the secure energy the world needs — policies that support 
energy security, such as predictable regulatory frameworks that 
enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions;
￮ driving changes in demand — policies that support changes in 
customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle 
standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel and a transition 
to low-carbon products; and
￮ growing low-carbon solutions — policies that encourage the 
development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for 
biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory 
frameworks for hydrogen and CCS.
Current and future financial and other resources 
allocated to the action plan
As we work towards net-zero emissions, we continue to optimise our 
capital allocation and operational expenditure, balancing energy 
security and demand and energy transition opportunities. We 
recognise that to achieve our strategic targets and ambition of 
generating more value with less GHG emissions, and to effectively 
manage our risk profile including climate-related risks and 
opportunities, will require significant operational and capital 
expenditure allocated in our annual budgets and future business plans.
Shell's capital investment and business plans include funding in support 
of our short- and medium-term energy transition plans as we work to 
achieve net zero by 2050. See "Investing in the energy transition" 
on pages 86-90 for more information about Shell's investments and 
funding supporting the implementation of our energy transition plans. 
Some financial institutions have been aligning their portfolios to a low-
carbon and net-zero world, driven by both regulatory and broader 
stakeholder pressures. Shell's financial strength and access to capital 
give us the ability to implement our climate change mitigation actions 
and adaptations.
See "Climate-related commercial risk" on page 81 for more information. 
Shell's capital investment and business plans, covering a 10-year cycle, 
include funding to deliver our 2030 targets and ambition. See 
"Resilience of Shell's strategy to different climate-related scenarios" on 
pages 86-90 for more information on our investments and expenditure 
which support our energy transition plans. 
See "The EU Taxonomy" on page 378 for information about Shell's 
taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned activities.
Targets related to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation (E1-4)
Information in this section reflects Shell's choice of boundary for 
its targets and ambition related to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. See "General basis for preparation of sustainability 
statements (BP-1)" on page 342 for more information. 
Climate-related targets
As part of its energy transition plans, Shell has set several climate-
related targets and an ambition, most of which predate the CSRD.
Sustainability Statements | Environment | Climate change (E1) continued
371 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 374 ----
For detailed information on Shell's climate-related targets and ambition, 
see "Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)" on page 364 
and "Our climate-related metrics and targets" on pages 93-106.
Shell has the following greenhouse gas emission reduction targets 
and ambition for Scope 1, 2 and 3:
￮In March 2024, Shell set an oil products ambition to reduce 
customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15–20% 
by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 (with 2021 the reference year), in 
accordance with the CSRD and the ESRS definition of greenhouse 
gas emission reduction target. [A] 
￮ In 2021, Shell set a target to halve the emissions from its operations 
(Scope 1) plus the energy it buys to run them (Scope 2) by 2030 
compared to 2016 levels on a net basis. This target predates the 
CSRD and differs from the ESRS boundary and definitions. It is a net 
target and has been set on an operational control boundary in line 
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol boundaries, and standard 
practice in the industry standards. The ESRS reporting boundary 
prescribed for Scope 1 and 2 deviates from the GHG Protocol (see 
"General basis for preparation of sustainability statements (BP-1)" on 
pages 342-344 for more information). In 2024, our combined Scope 
1 and 2 emissions reflected a 2% increase compared to 2023, and a 
30% reduction compared to the 2016 baseline, without the use of 
voluntary carbon credits, GHG removals or avoided emissions.
￮ In 2021, Shell also set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity 
(NCI) of the products it sells (see "Targets used by Shell to manage 
climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against 
targets" on page 101 for more information). These targets also 
predate the CSRD and differ from the ESRS boundary and 
definitions. These net intensity targets are based on an equity 
boundary, which deviates from the ESRS boundary and definitions 
for total GHG emissions.
[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 
million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e 
in 2021.
Furthermore, in 2021, Shell set a target to become a net-zero energy 
business by 2050 and is measuring progress towards this target using 
the other targets and ambition referenced in this section. For more 
information see "Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)" on 
page 364 and "Targets used by Shell to manage climate-related risks 
and opportunities and performance against targets" on page 101. 
Shell's target covers the full Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 
emissions from the energy products we sell. This target also predates 
the CSRD and differs from the CSRD definition of net-zero target. 
The pace of change in the energy transition is uncertain and there 
are currently no justified sectoral variations in line with recognised 
external sectoral pathways available. 
Shell's Operating Plan, outlook and business plans cover a 10-year 
forecast period and are updated every year. The business plan reflects 
our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next 10 years. 
However, Shell's business plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero 
emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. 
Shell's business plan reflects Shell's strategy. We will continue to 
update our business plan, price outlooks and assumptions as we move 
towards net-zero emissions by 2050. 
In addition to the above, Shell also set two additional climate-related 
targets that predate the CSRD: eliminate routine flaring from upstream 
operations by 2025 [B], and maintain methane emissions intensity 
below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 [C].
[B] This target was subject to the completion of the sale of The Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). With effect from January 1, 2025, SPDC ceased 
routine flaring. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 13, 2025, Shell completed 
the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.
[C] On an intensity basis.
The targets are forward-looking based on management's current 
expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, 
involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, 
performance or events to differ materially from those expressed 
or implied in this report. 
More detail on Shell's climate-related targets and ambition can be 
found in "Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)" on page 
364. The framework and methodology used to determine our targets 
and ambition are set out in "Targets used by Shell to manage climate-
related risks and opportunities and performance against targets" on 
page 101, recognising that most of Shell's climate-related targets 
predate the CSRD and differ from the ESRS boundary and definitions. 
See "Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over the 
short, medium and long term" on page 80 for details of the climate-
related risks our targets and ambition are designed to manage.
Decarbonisation levers
We set out our decarbonisation levers to achieve the absolute 
and intensity reduction targets and ambition we have set for GHG 
emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) together with the 
decarbonisation levers planned to achieve our net carbon intensity 
target and our Scope 3, Category 11 ambition in "Climate change 
mitigation actions and decarbonisation levers" on page 365.
See "Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2 target" on page 102 for a 
summary of the quantitative contributions of our decarbonisation levers 
to achieving our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target and 
"Progress towards our NCI target" on page 103 for a summary of the 
quantitative contributions of our decarbonisation levers to achieving 
our NCI reduction target.
Energy consumption and mix (E1-5)
Information in this section reflects the reporting boundary specified 
by the ESRS except where explicitly stated. See "General basis for 
preparation of sustainability statements (BP-1)" on pages 342-344 
for more information.
Energy consumption data in this section refer to primary (thermal) 
energy, such as the energy content of fuels used to generate electricity, 
steam, heat and mechanical energy. This includes energy from 
renewable and non-renewable sources. 
The energy consumption data below reflect the energy generated 
and purchased by facilities within the scope of the ESRS reporting 
boundary. This boundary differs from the operational control boundary 
used by Shell to monitor and report energy consumption as reported in 
"GHG emissions and energy consumption data – information provided 
in accordance with UK regulations" on page 107.
Energy consumed by facilities under our operational control is 
calculated as follows:
￮Energy generated from fuel and consumed is calculated by 
multiplying the volume of fuels consumed for energy purposes by 
their respective lower heating values.
￮ For purchased and consumed electricity from renewable sources, 
the energy is calculated using 100% generation efficiency. 
￮ For purchased and consumed electricity from non-renewable sources, 
the energy is calculated using actual electricity purchased, multiplied 
by country-specific electricity generation efficiency factors from 
International Energy Agency statistics to determine the associated 
thermal energy expended at the source. 
￮ Energy for purchased and consumed steam and heat is calculated 
from actual steam and heat purchased, multiplied by a supplier-
specific conversion efficiency or by a generic efficiency factor where 
supplier-specific data are not available.

of consumption for consolidated assets not under Shell's operational 
control where the information was not available. 
Net revenue, used as the denominator, corresponds to Revenue as 
presented in Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income and is prepared 
using the financial control boundary (in line with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards), where 100% revenue is reported 
for fully consolidated subsidiaries plus the Shell share of revenue 
recognised from joint operations, irrespective of operational control 
considerations. The numerator therefore differs from the denominator 
due to the inclusion of Shell-operated equity-accounted assets in the 
ESRS reporting boundary. 
For 2024, the resulting metric is set out in the table below, recognising 
the misalignment of boundaries across total energy consumption and 
net revenue. As revenue is expected to fluctuate with oil and gas prices 
and other factors which are not correlated with energy consumption, 
in our view, the information so calculated does not provide a reliable 
measure of energy intensity, nor does it permit a realistic comparison 
between reporting entities and over time.

Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions (E1-6)
We follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard, which defines three scopes of GHG emissions:
￮Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources under Shell's 
operational control;
￮ Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased 
energy consumed by Shell assets under operational control; and
￮ Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions 
associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.

GHG emissions comprise CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, 
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and 
nitrogen trifluoride, with CO2 and methane being the most significant 
contributors. 
Basis of preparation – Scope 1 and 2 emissions
In this section, Scope 1 and 2 emissions are presented in accordance 
with the ESRS boundary. See "General basis for preparation of 
sustainability statements (BP-1)" on pages 342-344 for more 
information.
Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions inventory was prepared in line with 
the requirements outlined in ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with 
Guidance at the Organization Level for Quantification and Reporting 
of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals and the GHG Protocol's 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.
In line with external standards, we aggregate our GHG emissions 
into tonnes of CO2 equivalent by applying global warming potential 
(GWP) factors to non-CO2 GHGs. Factors applied in 2024 were taken 
from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) over a 100-year time 
period, as stipulated by the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting [A].
[A] We use GWP factors from AR5 to calculate our emissions, as stipulated by UK regulations 
which Shell is also subject to. Updates to GWP factors published in AR6, which ESRS 
requires us to use, are immaterial to Shell's GHG inventory.
Scope 1 emissions
All significant sources were included in our Scope 1 inventory. 
Sources included comprise: 
￮combustion of carbon-containing fuels in stationary equipment
(e.g. boilers, gas turbines) for energy generation; 
￮ combustion of carbon-containing fuels in mobile equipment
(e.g. trucks, vessels, mobile rigs);
￮ flares;
￮ venting and emissions from industrial processes (e.g. hydrogen 
plants, catalytic cracking units); and 
￮ fugitive emissions, including piping and equipment leaks and
non-routine events. 
Our Scope 1 emissions follow the GHG Protocol guidance. As a result, 
the following are not included in our reported Scope 1 emissions:
￮CO2 emissions from biogenic sources such as biofuels or biomass; 
￮ captured CO2 that was subsequently sold or otherwise transferred 
to third parties;
￮ CO2 captured and sequestered using CCS technologies; and 
￮ carbon credits.
Scope 2 emissions
All significant sources were included in our Scope 2 inventory. Sources 
included comprise indirect emissions from purchased and consumed 
electricity, steam and heat. We did not identify any assets with 
imported cooling or compressed air used for energy purposes.
Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market- and location-based 
methods separately as defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance. Scope 2 emissions are presented on a gross basis.
Basis of preparation – Scope 3 emissions 
See "Basis of preparation – Scope 3 emissions" on page 100 for 
the basis of preparation of the Scope 3 emissions we report on an 
equity basis.
Contractual instruments used in relation to Scope 2 
GHG emissions
We consider energy to be derived from renewable sources if the 
origin of the purchased energy is clearly defined in supplier contracts 
including renewable power purchasing agreements and market 
instruments such as Guarantee of Origin from renewable sources in 
Europe or Renewable Energy Certificates in the USA and Canada. 
The contractual instruments we have used in relation to the purchase of 
energy, both bundled with energy generation attributes and unbundled 
with energy attribute claims (i.e. rights to claim renewable energy 
attributes separate from the power purchased), by assets under our 
operational control, are as follows. Information from assets not 
operated by Shell could not reasonably be estimated in 2024.

GHG intensity based on net revenue
Total GHG emissions, used as the numerator, is prepared as required 
by the ESRS and reported in the table "Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and total 
GHG emissions" on page 373. 
Net revenue, used as the denominator, corresponds to Revenue as 
presented in Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income and is prepared 
using the financial control boundary (in line with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards), where 100% revenue is reported 
for fully consolidated subsidiaries plus the Shell share of revenue 
recognised from joint operations, irrespective of operational 
control considerations. 
Sustainability Statements | Environment | Climate change (E1) continued

---- Page 377 ----
The numerator therefore differs from the denominator due to the 
inclusion of Shell-operated equity-accounted assets in the ESRS 
reporting boundary. Additionally, revenue is expected to fluctuate 
with oil and gas prices and other factors which are not correlated with 
GHG emissions. As such, in our view, the information so calculated 
does not provide a reliable measure of energy intensity, nor does it 
permit a realistic comparison between reporting entities and over time. 
Nonetheless, we have prepared the GHG intensity per net revenue 
metric, recognising the misalignment of boundaries across total GHG 
emissions and revenue.
For 2024, the resulting metric is set out in the table below on both a 
market-based and location-based basis.

GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed 
through carbon credits (E1-7)
Removal of greenhouse gases refers to the withdrawal of greenhouse 
gases from the atmosphere as a result of deliberate human activities. 
There are two main types of removal mechanism: enhancement of 
natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere, for 
example through natural carbon sinks, or technical or chemical 
processes that capture CO2 and sequester it underground. Carbon 
capture and storage is considered a removal mechanism only when 
it results in "negative emissions", for example when paired with 
technologies like direct air capture. 
In 2024, Shell has not used removal mechanisms in its own operations 
or its upstream and downstream value chain.

Shell's Nature Based Solutions business invests in entities and projects, 
and develops projects that conserve, enhance and restore ecosystems 
– such as forests, grasslands and wetlands – to prevent GHG 
emissions or reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. When these entities and 
projects begin to issue carbon credits, Shell may choose to participate 
in the offtake of these credits as part of its offsetting activities. 
Carbon credits may contribute to our aim to become a net-zero 
emissions energy business by 2050. They may be used by Shell and its 
customers to compensate emissions in line with the carbon mitigation 
hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. 
We believe that the carbon credits need to have a robust carbon 
benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. 
We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credit 
projects we invest in are of high quality, and are developed and 
certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. 
These include the Verra Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program, 
Gold Standard carbon offset certification and the ACR carbon 
crediting programme (formerly American Carbon Registry). 
We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, 
and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have 
been adequately considered. We also buy credits from nature- and 
technology-based projects developed by others. We carefully source 
and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market.

[A] One carbon credit represents the avoidance or removal of one metric tonne of CO 2 
equivalent.
In 2024, Shell accounted for the retirement of 17.3 million carbon 
credits, of which 16.4 million were related to our NCI (including 
2.4 million linked to the sale of energy products).
We also buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects 
and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we 
purchase and retire from the market. The use of high-quality carbon 
credits, if required, is one of the decarbonisation levers available to 
Shell. We may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any 
remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon 
mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.

Shell's business plan includes the option to retire a range of high-quality 
carbon credits in the future, as set out in the table below:
Range of voluntary carbon credits planned to be retired 
in the future
unit
2025 to 
2030 
inclusive
Range of voluntary carbon credits outside the 
value chain planned to be retired in the future

credits 48-64
We will review and update the planned range of voluntary carbon 
credits to be retired in the future as part of the annual operating plan 
process. We anticipate that the planned range will fluctuate over time, 
reflecting the uncertainty of the energy transition.
In relation to our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we have no 
quantitative plans for the use of carbon credits due to the uncertainties 
regarding the pace of the energy transition, customer demand and the 
related development of our business models in the decades leading up 
to 2050.
Internal carbon pricing (E1-8)
Shell uses shadow prices, called CO2 project screening values (PSVs), 
to assess the CO2 resilience of all its business activities to potential 
future carbon costs, such as those arising from mandatory emission 
trading schemes or carbon taxes. PSVs do not consider costs that 
may be applicable to Scope 3 emissions. 
We consider the potential costs associated with operational GHG 
emissions when preparing Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management 
Plans for projects and assets, and when evaluating capital projects 
before a final investment decision. For each region, we have developed 
short-, medium- and long-term estimates of the future costs of carbon. 
These are reviewed and updated annually. See Note 4 to the 
"Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 255 for further details on 
our regional cost of carbon estimates and "Policies related to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation (E1-2)" on page 369 for further 
details of our policies in respect of operational GHG emissions. 
Up to 2030, our cost of carbon emission estimates are largely policy-
driven through emission trading schemes or taxation levied by 
governments, which vary significantly from country to country. Beyond 
2030, when policy predictions are more challenging, our estimates are 
based on the expected cost of the abatement technologies required to 
meet our 2050 target. 
The estimated cost is trending towards $50 or $230 per tonne (RT24), 
depending on the country, in 2050. See Note 4 to the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" on page 261 for further details on our regional 
cost of carbon estimates. See "Carbon pricing" on page 89.
Shell's cost of compliance with the emissions trading and related 
schemes was around $381 million in 2024, as stated in Shell's 
Consolidated Statement of Income for 2024. In 2024, 43% of our 
Scope 1 emissions under operational control were reported by assets 
covered by regulated emission trading schemes [A].
[A] In 2024, Scope 1 emissions covered by regulated emissions trading schemes for facilities 
not operated by Shell could not be estimated.
Anticipated financial effects from material physical 
and transition risks and potential climate-related 
opportunities (E1-9)
Under the provisions of "Appendix C: List of phased-in Disclosure 
Requirements" to the ESRS, Shell has elected to use the phase-in 
provisions governing "Anticipated financial effects from material 
physical and transition risks and potential climate-related opportunities 
(E1-9)" for the first year of preparation of its Sustainability Statements.
However, a number of anticipated and potential effects are set out 
in Note 4 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 255. 
This note includes an overview of key assumptions used for financial 
planning related to climate change and the energy transition in 
addition to details of the sensitivity of carrying values to commodity 
prices, carbon emission costs, chemical and refining margins, discount 
rates and demand, if different assumptions were applied.

The EU Taxonomy
Introduction
Regulation EU 2020/852 (the "Taxonomy Regulation" or the 
"Taxonomy") is a classification system for determining when an economic 
activity can be considered environmentally sustainable according to 
European Union (EU) standards. It aims to encourage investment in a 
low-carbon economy by creating common definitions of sustainability 
and mandatory disclosures to help investors make informed decisions.
Non-financial companies screen their eligible activities against the 
taxonomy's technical criteria for environmental sustainability and 
minimum safeguards. This allows them to calculate the share of revenue 
(turnover), capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure 
(opex) that can be classified as aligned. 
Shell supports the EU's ambition to achieve net-zero emissions, which 
aligns with our own target to become a net-zero emissions energy business 
by 2050. We have reported against the taxonomy voluntarily since 2021 
because we recognise the importance of increasing transparency about 
how companies are progressing in the energy transition. 
In anticipation of the transposition by the Netherlands of the EU Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) into national law, a key 
development for Shell in 2024 has been the voluntary implementation of the 
CSRD and the accompanying European Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(ESRS). This means Shell plc will come fully into scope of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation upon the transposition of the CSRD by the Netherlands into law. 
The CSRD extends the EU Taxonomy Regulation's reporting obligation to 
third-country issuers that are listed on European exchanges. 
Reporting scope
The taxonomy's reporting scope covers Shell's global business, based 
on the financial consolidation boundary. Shell's eligible activities 
include elements of our chemicals, power generation and storage, 
hydrogen, biogas and biofuels, electric vehicle charging, carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) and nature-based solutions (NBS) 
businesses. Our remaining businesses are non-eligible. 
The taxonomy's reporting basis differs from that used in our financial 
statements, which are based on International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS). 
For example, the taxonomy does not recognise our interests in equity-
accounted joint ventures and associates, goodwill, feasibility expenses or 
integrated value chains. These and other differences result in lower 
reported turnover, capex and opex under the taxonomy compared with 
our other disclosures. 
Technical criteria
The taxonomy's technical criteria recognise stringent levels of 
environmental performance rather than transitional steps or alternative 
pathways. The complexity of the criteria and their reliance on 
EU standards can make the criteria difficult to interpret and apply, 
especially for activities outside the EU. 
Eligible and aligned share of Shell's business
In 2024, Shell's eligible turnover was $9,353 million or 3.3% (2023: 
$8,445 million or 2.7%), capex was $3,270 million or 10.6% (2023: 
$6,032 million or 19.2%) and opex was $1,181 million or 24.7% 
(2023: $1,382 million or 25.9%). 
In 2024, our aligned turnover was $698 million or 0.2% (2023: $542 
million or 0.2%), capex was $1,849 million or 6.0% (2023: $4,173 
million or 13.3%) and opex was $114 million or 2.4% (2023: $30 million 
or 0.6%). Our taxonomy-aligned activities include elements of our 
hydrogen, wind, solar, battery storage, biogas and biofuels, and EV 
charging businesses, excluding individual assets that are not currently 
aligned with the technical screening criteria. 
The taxonomy does not provide a complete picture of our low-carbon 
business. Nevertheless, we support efforts to improve the framework and 
advance climate-related disclosure more broadly. For more information, 
see "Our journey to net zero" on pages 76-108.

377 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 380 ----
The taxonomy framework
The taxonomy establishes technical criteria for environmental 
sustainability across more than 150 economic activities and six 
environmental objectives. 
An activity is taxonomy-eligible if it is described in a delegated 
act adopted under the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Such an activity 
is eligible regardless of whether it complies with the technical 
screening criteria. 
An activity is taxonomy-aligned if it contributes substantially to one 
or more environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of 
the other objectives, is carried out in compliance with minimum human 
and labour rights safeguards, and complies with the relevant technical 
screening criteria.
The EU has stated that the taxonomy will develop over time. It notes 
that the fact that an activity does not contribute substantially to one of 
the EU's environmental objectives does not necessarily mean it is not 
sustainable. Not all activities with the potential to make a substantial 
contribution to the environmental objectives are yet included in the 
framework.
Our eligibility and alignment
Our eligible and aligned turnover, capex and opex are presented in 
the table below. 
Eligible turnover increased by $908 million, mainly due to revenues 
generated from the manufacture of chemicals and plastics. Eligible 
capex decreased by $2,762 million compared to 2023 due to fewer 
acquisitions of eligible activities in 2024. Eligible opex decreased by 
$201 million, and mainly consisted of operational costs in chemicals 
and plastics business.
Five economic activities were assessed as taxonomy-aligned, including 
the manufacture of hydrogen, electricity from wind, electricity from 
solar, storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon road 
transport. For a sixth activity, the manufacture of biogas and biofuels, 
we assessed some elements of our activities as taxonomy-aligned and 
some as non-aligned.
Aligned turnover increased by $156 million, mainly due to revenues 
generated by renewable energy and low-carbon road transport 
businesses. Aligned capex decreased by $2,324 million compared to 
capex reported in 2023 due to fewer acquisitions of eligible activities 
in 2024. Aligned opex increased by $84 million, mainly due to 
CrossWind Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm reaching 
commercial operations. 
Basis of preparation
Shell seeks to prepare its disclosure in accordance with Delegated 
Regulation EU 2021/2178 (the "Disclosures Delegated Act") as well 
as several Commission Notices containing answers to frequently asked 
questions about taxonomy reporting issued between 2021 and 2024.
Shell has adopted a three-step process to prepare its taxonomy 
disclosure: 
￮we identify our eligible activities and map these to our assets and 
projects; 
￮ we screen those activities for alignment with the technical criteria 
and the minimum safeguards; and
￮ we calculate the metrics for eligibility and alignment, based on 
the screening results.
Each step is discussed below. 
Identification of eligible activities
Shell has assessed its business against the economic activities 
qualifying for the taxonomy's six environmental objectives. These 
include the activities listed in Delegated Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the 
"Climate Delegated Act", as amended), the gas-related activities listed 
in Delegated Regulation EU 2022/1214 (the "Complementary Climate 
Delegated Act") and the activities listed in Delegated Regulation EU 
2023/2486 (the "Environmental Delegated Act").

---- Page 381 ----
The taxonomy does not provide criteria for determining when an 
economic activity is in scope for reporting. According to EU guidance, 
an economic activity takes place when resources — such as capital, 
goods, labour, manufacturing techniques or intermediary products — 
are combined to produce specific goods or services. Based on this 
definition, Shell treats economic activities as in scope for reporting if 
they correspond to final goods or services offered for sale to customers, 
or if they are intended to be offered for sale in the future, based on 
current business plans. We do not report on factors of production 
or overheads, such as real estate or IT, since these do not represent 
a final good or service. We also do not report on activities which are 
immaterial to our results and are not intended to operate as stand-
alone businesses, such as sales of waste heat or electricity from 
refineries and chemical plants.
For 2024, we identified a total of 13 economic activities as eligible 
for reporting. Although we screen our activities against all applicable 
environmental objectives, the discussion of our performance against the 
technical screening criteria focuses on the climate mitigation objective.
Alignment screening
Shell has developed an internal process to assess its eligible activities 
for alignment with the technical screening criteria and minimum 
safeguards. This is based on our understanding of the requirements of 
the Disclosures Delegated Act.
For each eligible activity, we begin by identifying the assets in scope 
for reporting. An asset i
s typically a discrete element of physical plant 
or equipment that contributes to an economic activity, such as a 
chemical plant or a wind farm, or a project in development that is 
intended to become an asset in the future. 
Once the assets for each activity have been defined, we review the 
Substantial Contribution and Do No Significant Harm criteria and 
proceed to screen the assets. Screening is carried out by subject 
matter experts and subject to cross-checking at various levels.
The technical criteria are highly detailed, with extensive references 
to European standards and regulations, which are not widely used 
outside the region. Applying them poses several challenges including: 
￮where it is difficult to translate EU standards or regulations to a non-
EU context; 
￮ where Shell is materially aligned with a complex technical standard 
but varies in certain details; 
￮ where the criteria are expressed in qualitative terms that are open 
to interpretation; or 
￮ where the criteria are designed for a different range of applications 
than the one implied by the activity description.
These situations require us to apply judgement in determining whether 
the criteria are met.
Sometimes it is not possible to associate eligible turnover, capex or 
opex with a specific asset. For example, this can happen when we incur 
research and development expenses for an activity but the expenditure 
cannot be tied to a specific project for screening purposes. If alignment 
cannot be reasonably established according to our alignment 
screening process, the relevant amounts are classified as eligible 
but non-aligned.
Situations can arise where we may not be able to screen all assets in 
scope of an activity. This can occur when an activity contains a large 
number of early-stage projects and it is more efficient to focus on the 
most material projects and treat the remaining ones as eligible but
non-aligned. This situation can also arise when assets are acquired
late in the reporting cycle and there is insufficient time to conduct a 
technical screening, or when it has not been possible to obtain 
information about a non-operated asset from joint-venture partners. 
Such assets are treated as eligible but non-aligned by default. 
Assets that do not have eligible turnover, capex or opex to report 
are non-eligible and are not subject to technical screening. In practice, 
many early-stage projects are non-eligible because they have no 
turnover or capex to report, while feasibility expenditures incurred 
prior to a final investment decision (FID) are considered non-eligible 
under the taxonomy's definition of opex. Technical screening outcomes 
described in this disclosure apply only to eligible assets that have been 
screened in 2024.
Where some assets or products in scope of an economic activity are 
assessed as fully aligned with the technical screening criteria while 
others are not, an allocation method is applied so that only the aligned 
portion is included. For example, this can occur when some biofuels 
or biogas production is assessed as taxonomy-aligned and some 
is assessed as non-aligned. 
Where there is uncertainty with regard to how to interpret or apply any 
of the technical screening criteria in our alignment screening process, 
the relevant assets are assessed as non-aligned. In such cases, we 
intend to monitor future developments and update our approach 
as appropriate.
Substantial Contribution
The taxonomy's Substantial Contribution criteria are designed to ensure 
that an economic activity either has a substantial positive impact on 
one of the environmental objectives or substantially reduces negative 
impacts on the environment. The criteria vary from activity to activity.
Shell screened its eligible economic activities against all relevant 
environmental objectives. For five activities, assets in scope for 
screening were assessed as aligned with the Substantial Contribution 
criteria for climate mitigation, including solar, wind, hydrogen 
manufacturing, storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-
carbon road transport. For a sixth activity, manufacture of biogas and 
biofuels, some elements were assessed as aligned and some as non-
aligned, based on the proportion of feedstock meeting the Substantial 
Contribution criteria. 
Assets in scope for our remaining activities were assessed as non-
aligned. For two activities, alignment could not be established due to 
uncertainty about how to interpret and apply the technical screening 
criteria. This was the case for carbon transport and storage, where 
there are questions as to whether local standards are equivalent to 
the international and EU standards referenced by the criteria, and 
for conservation forestry, where the technical criteria differ from 
internationally recognised carbon credit standards.
Do No Significant Harm
The taxonomy's Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria are designed 
to ensure that an economic activity does not impede other 
environmental objectives being reached. The combination of the 
Substantial Contribution and Do No Significant Harm criteria is 
intended to ensure coherence between the taxonomy's objectives and 
to avoid progress towards one objective being made at the expense of 
another.
The DNSH criteria for activities contributing to climate change mitigation 
include detailed requirements for climate change adaptation, water, 
circular economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity. The criteria vary 
for each environmental objective and activity.
Shell screened its eligible economic activities against all relevant 
environmental objectives. For five activities, assets in scope for 
screening were assessed as aligned with the DNSH criteria for climate

mitigation, including solar, wind, hydrogen manufacturing, storage of 
electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport. Some 
elements of our manufacture of biogas and biofuels activities were 
assessed as aligned and some as non-aligned.
In 2024, we continued to review physical climate risks for our eligible 
activities in line with the requirements of the Generic criteria for Do No 
Significant Harm to Climate Change Adaptation (Appendix A). The 
review of the eligible activities followed the approach set out in 
"Climate-related physical risks" on page 138.
In assessing alignment with the DNSH criteria, we were required to 
apply judgement to our electric vehicle charging activities. Electric 
vehicle charging is referenced by multiple economic activities in the 
taxonomy, each of which has a different set of technical screening 
criteria. There is a lack of consensus in the market about which one 
to apply to different electrical vehicle charging business models. Shell 
categorised all its electric vehicle charging businesses under the activity 
with the most stringent criteria, "6.15 Infrastructure Enabling Low-
Carbon Road Transport and Public Transport".
For this activity, we assessed the DNSH criteria for waste management 
to be more applicable to medium- or large-scale infrastructure projects 
than to distributed, small-scale electric vehicle charging infrastructure 
with a small construction footprint. Our operating standards for electric 
vehicle charging include measures to limit waste generation and 
encourage re-use and recycling, which we assess as materially 
equivalent.
Our remaining eligible activities were assessed as non-aligned with one 
or more of the DNSH criteria. In several cases, we assessed ourselves 
as non-aligned due to uncertainty about how to interpret various 
aspects of the technical screening criteria.
Minimum safeguards
The taxonomy defines the minimum safeguards as procedures 
implemented by a company to ensure alignment with the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, including the eight fundamental 
conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour 
Organisation on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the 
International Bill of Human Rights.
Respect for human rights is embedded in the Shell General 
Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. We have an integrated 
approach to human rights that is embedded into our policies and 
processes, which are applicable to all employees and contractors. 
This approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights.
We assessed our taxonomy-eligible activities as compliant with the 
minimum safeguards [A]. See "Human Rights" on page 121 for more 
information.
Capex Plan assessment
As specified in the Disclosures Delegated Act, capex and opex can be 
treated as aligned when such expenditures form part of a Capex Plan 
aimed at expanding an aligned activity or upgrading an eligible 
activity to enable it to become aligned. 
To qualify, a Capex Plan must be approved by management and 
disclosed at the economic activity aggregated level. The expansion 
or upgrade must take place within five years unless a longer period 
is justified by the specific features of the activity and the upgrade 
concerned. This can be up to a maximum of 10 years. The justification for 
a longer transition period must feature in the Capex Plan and be included
in the disclosure. If the Capex Plan fails to meet the conditions within 
the specified timeframe, previously published KPIs must be restated.
A lack of consensus exists in the market about how to interpret various 
aspects of the technical screening criteria. There is also uncertainty 
about how the criteria might apply to future performance conditions. 
Shell has therefore decided not to recognise any capex or opex as 
aligned under the Capex Plan provision in 2024.
Enabling and transitional activities 
The taxonomy designates a subset of aligned activities as "enabling" 
or "transitional". 
Transitional activities are those for which low-carbon alternatives are 
not yet available and which:
￮have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best 
performance in the sector or industry;
￮ do not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon 
alternatives; and
￮ do not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the 
economic lifetime of those assets. 
Enabling activities are those which directly enable others to make a 
substantial contribution to an environmental objective, provided they:
￮do not lead to a lock-in of assets that undermine long-term 
environmental goals, considering the economic lifetime of those 
assets; and
￮ have a substantial positive impact on the basis of life-cycle 
considerations. 
An economic activity is only transitional or enabling if it complies 
with the technical screening criteria. In 2024, two of Shell's activities, 
storage of electricity and infrastructure enabling low-carbon road 
transport, qualified as enabling. 
Calculating the key performance indicators
The taxonomy KPIs consist of separate measures for eligible and 
aligned turnover, capex and opex. Each measure is calculated as 
the amount associated with eligible or aligned economic activities 
(numerator) divided by the total (denominator). In 2024, there was 
no change in the approach to calculating the KPIs.
Turnover
The turnover KPI comprises the Revenue line from the Consolidated 
Statement of Income. This measure is reconciled as follows.
 EU Taxonomy turnover 2024
 
$ million
2024 2023
Revenue from contracts with customers  274,347  301,013 
Revenue from other sources  9,965  15,607 
Total EUT Turnover  284,312  316,620 
Shell's reporting of revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income 
follows the IFRS definition, under which realised and unrealised gains 
and losses from hedging are recognised in revenue. We follow the 
same principles when calculating the numerator and denominator for 
the turnover KPI. In 2024, excluding hedging effects would have an 
immaterial impact on the numerator and denominator. 
[A] In 2021, a notification to the Netherlands National Contact Point (NCP) was raised 
concerning the activities of SPDC as operator of the SPDC JV in Nigeria, in which SPDC 
holds a 30% interest. In 2024, the NCP, in its final statement, highlighted 
recommendations in relation to SPDC's community feedback mechanism (CFM). SPDC 
continues to implement improvements to further align this mechanism with the UNGP 
effectiveness criteria for operational grievance mechanisms. All our reported eligible 
economic activities fall outside of Nigeria. As detailed elsewhere in this report, on March 
13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance.

Capex
The capex KPI comprises the Additions line from the "Consolidated 
Financial Statements" Note 11 – Goodwill and other intangible assets; 
and the Additions line from the "Consolidated Financial Statements" 
Note 12 – Property, plant and equipment. Goodwill is excluded from 
the measure.
When business combinations involving an eligible activity occur in a 
prior reporting period but purchase price allocation takes place within 
the current period, we recognise the resulting movements to property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets as an addition. These 
amounts are contained within Note 11 – Goodwill and other intangible 
assets and Note 12 – Property, plant and equipment in the Sales, 
retirements and other movements line and are added to the numerator 
and denominator.
This measure is reconciled as follows.
 EU Taxonomy capex 2024
 
$ million
2024 2023
Additions to property, plant and equipment  26,446  25,831 
Additions to goodwill and other intangible 
assets  4,611  6,994 
Less: Goodwill  155  1,436 
Add: Other movements  —  83 
Total EUT Capex  30,902  31,472 
The numerator for aligned capex comprises the part of eligible capex 
that is (a) associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities; (b) 
part of a Capex Plan to expand an aligned activity or to enable a non-
aligned activity to become aligned; and (c) related to the purchase of 
output from taxonomy-eligible activities. Due to limited guidance about 
how (c) should be calculated, our reporting focuses on (a) and (b) only. 
The capex KPI as defined by the EU Taxonomy Regulation differs from 
Shell's cash capital expenditure measure. The latter monitors investing 
activities on a cash basis, excluding items such as lease additions, 
which do not necessarily result in cash outflows in the period. This 
measure comprises the following lines from the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows: Capital expenditure, investments in joint ventures and 
associates and investments in equity securities. The cash capital 
expenditure is presented on page 272.
Opex
The taxonomy defines the opex KPI as costs associated with 
maintenance and repair, research and development and short-term 
leases. This is narrower than Shell's definition of operating expenses 
and does not capture all of our expenditure on otherwise eligible 
activities. This measure is reconciled as follows:
* Non-GAAP measure (see page 445).
 EU Taxonomy opex 2024

expenses 12,439  13,433 
Add: Expenses relating to short-term leases  360  495 
Total EUT Opex  4,784  5,333 
The numerator for aligned opex comprises the part of eligible opex that 
is (a) associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities; (b) part of 
a Capex Plan to expand an aligned activity or to enable a non-aligned 
activity to become aligned; and (c) related to the purchase of output 
from taxonomy-eligible activities. Due to limited guidance about how 
(c) should be calculated, our reporting focuses on (a) and (b) only.
Other accounting policies
Eligibility and alignment are calculated separately for each 
economic activity. 
The reporting boundary for each economic activity is determined by 
the scope of the activity description contained in the relevant 
delegated act. This boundary frequently differs from our integrated 
value chains and segmental reporting. As a result, various adjustments 
are needed to calculate the required figures. For example, we exclude 
sales of third-party products as well as trading and retailing from the 
calculation of the KPIs. These are significant for Shell's integrated 
business model but are not eligible for the taxonomy. Although intra-
group sales are non-eligible, sales to our trading business are used in 
certain circumstances to calculate the turnover attributable to eligible 
parts of the value chain. 
When a reporting entity is engaged in multiple economic activities, 
an allocation method is applied so that only the appropriate part is 
included. Reconciliation is made to total turnover, capex and opex 
to avoid double counting.
In some cases, a subsidiary or other related undertaking may have 
interests in more than one economic activity but insufficient data are 
available to disaggregate turnover, capex and opex. In these cases, 
we allocate the KPIs to the activity that best describes the primary 
business of the entity. 
Shell's eligible and aligned turnover, capex and opex are presented on 
pages 384-386 in accordance with templates specified in Annex II of 
the Disclosures Delegated Act as amended. Disclosures concerning our 
gas-related activities are presented on pages 387-390 in accordance 
with the requirements of the Disclosures Delegated Act, Articles 8(6) 
and (7), including the templates specified in Annex XII.

Contextual information on the KPIs
This section provides additional contextual information to accompany 
the presentation of the turnover, capex and opex KPIs on pages 
384-386.
Turnover
In 2024, Shell's taxonomy-eligible turnover was $9,353 million or 3.3% 
of the total, which was an increase in absolute terms of $908 million 
compared with 2023. The economic activities that made the biggest 
contribution to eligible turnover were the manufacture of chemicals and 
plastics, renewable energy (including wind, solar and installation of 
renewable energy technologies), and the manufacture of biogas and 
biofuels.
Eligible turnover for the manufacture of chemicals and plastics 
increased to $8,032 million in 2024 from $7,082 million in 2023 as a 
result of higher production volume and better asset performance. 
Additional eligible revenues of $742 million were generated by 
renewable energy, driven by the wind business. Revenue of $258 
million was generated by the manufacture of biogas and biofuels. 
Aligned turnover of $698 million was an increase in absolute terms of 
$156 million compared with 2023, mainly due to revenues generated 
by renewable energy from wind and solar.
Capex
In 2024, Shell's taxonomy-eligible capex was $3,270 million or 
10.6% of the total, which was a decrease of $2,762 million compared 
with 2023. The economic activities that made the biggest contribution 
to eligible capex included renewable energy from solar and wind, the 
manufacture of chemicals and plastics, and the manufacture of biogas 
and biofuels.
Eligible capex for solar and wind was a combined $1,026 million in 
2024 compared with $1,596 million in 2023 due to further capital re-
allocation in the renewable energy business. Eligible capex for 
chemicals and plastics was a combined $898 million in 2024 
compared with $999 million in 2023, reflecting the completion of 
construction activities after a fire incident in one of our plants. Eligible 
capex for biogas and biofuels was $532 million in 2024 compared 
with $2,078 million in 2023, which was driven by a material business 
acquisition in 2023. Eligible capex for low-carbon transport, which 
includes electric vehicle charging and hydrogen mobility, was $336 
million in 2024 compared with $991 million in 2023, driven by fewer 
acquisitions in the business. Eligible capex for hydrogen was $295 
million in 2024 compared with $199 million in 2023.
Aligned capex of $1,849 million was a decrease in absolute terms of 
$2,324 million compared with 2023, mainly driven by fewer 
acquisitions and further capital reallocation in the renewable energy 
business.
Capex additions related to acquisitions through business combinations 
are aggregated with other capex additions.
Opex
In 2024, Shell's taxonomy-eligible opex was $1,181 million or 24.7% of 
the total, which was a decrease of $201 million compared with 2023. 
The economic activities that made the biggest contribution to eligible 
opex included manufacture of chemicals and plastics, renewable 
energy from wind, and manufacture of biogas and biofuels. Our 
chemicals business is relatively mature compared with our other eligible 
activities and therefore accounts for the largest share of opex.
Eligible opex for chemicals and plastics was a combined $971 million 
in 2024 compared with opex of $1,133 million in 2023, mainly due to 
global costs reduction. Lower opex for biogas and biofuels and 
hydrogen were mainly driven by lower research and development 
expenditure.
Aligned opex of $114 million was higher compared with $30 million 
reported in 2023, and mainly related to operational costs in the wind 
business.

result in lower reported turnover, capex and opex under the taxonomy compared with our other disclosures.

Pollution (E2) 
We seek to manage the impact of our operations on air quality, 
water quality and soil and groundwater resources, while complying 
with applicable regulations. 
Our double materiality assessment has identified emissions to air, 
discharges to water, soil and groundwater, oil spills in Nigeria and 
hazardous substances as material topics. See "Material impacts, risks 
and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business 
model (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of the process to 
identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" 
on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
Our businesses emit pollutants to air and water, subject to limits 
established by Shell or local standards, whichever are most stringent. 
Managing these emissions is part of our commitment to pursue the 
goal of no harm to people and to respect nature by protecting the 
environment. We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the 
intention of minimising discharges to air and water.
We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention 
of avoiding discharges to soil or groundwater. However, there is 
potential for unintentional contamination to occur for reasons such 
as operational failure, accidents, unusual corrosion or third-party 
interference including theft or sabotage. We prepare and practise 
our emergency response to incidents and proactively manage soil 
and groundwater impacts and risks.
Our products and operations involve the use of hazardous substances 
with the potential to harm people and the environment. We work to 
ensure our many products — such as fuels, lubricants and chemicals — 
are safe throughout their life cycle.
This section explains how Shell manages air quality, water quality, soil 
and groundwater, and hazardous substances. See "Water (E3)" on 
page 395 for information about our approach to water stewardship, 
and "Safety" on pages 429-438 for information about our approach 
to process safety, emergency response and oil spills.
Policies related to pollution (E2-1)
Our approach to pollution control is governed by our Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards. These contain 
standards related to air quality, water quality, product stewardship, soil 
and groundwater, as well as related standards such as process safety 
and emergency response. See "SEAM Standards" on page 130 for 
more information.
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
Air quality
We design, operate and maintain our facilities to minimise emissions of 
pollutants to air. Under normal operating conditions, we emit pollutants 
to air subject to limits established by local regulators or our own 
standards, whichever are more stringent.
Volatile organic compounds (VOC)
Our standards require emission sources with VOC emissions exceeding 
100 tonnes per year to establish, implement and maintain a risk-based 
programme of monitoring to detect leaks and implement repairs. 
Our standards require controls to be implemented to reduce emissions 
from such sources to as low as reasonably practicable (excluding 
combustion sources and process streams where VOC content is less 
than 10% by weight). 
Nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulphur oxides (SOX)
Our standards for emissions of NOX and SOX distinguish between 
facilities located in member countries of the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD), whose regulatory frameworks 
are generally mature, and those located in countries outside the 
OECD, where they may be less so. For existing refineries or chemical 
plants in non-OECD countries, our standards set minimum performance 
levels for emissions of NOX and SOX. For other types of facilities 
located outside the OECD, those facilities are required to select an 
OECD country and apply the limits of the country selected. 
We require new facilities, and modifications to existing facilities, after 
July 1, 2024, to meet the International Finance Corporation's emission 
guidelines for NOX and SOX. Where this cannot be achieved, our 
standards require emissions to be reduced to as low as reasonably 
practicable. We also require new facilities, and modifications to 
existing facilities, after July 1, 2024, to assess the effect of future 
emissions on air quality in the surrounding area (airshed) and to meet 
airshed ambient air quality specifications. Where this is not achievable, 
emissions are to be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.
Water quality
Our standards require disposal of waste water from our assets, projects 
or businesses to be managed in line with water stewardship principles. 
Our discharges to water are also subject to limits established by local 
regulators.
We design, operate and maintain our onshore and offshore facilities 
to minimise discharges to water according to local regulatory 
requirements and our own standards. Our standards require new 
onshore assets and modifications of existing onshore assets after July 1, 
2024, to meet the more stringent of our own or local regulatory limits 
for discharges of certain pollutants and increases in water temperature. 
Our standards are derived from the International Finance Corporation's 
environmental, health and safety discharge criteria.
Our standards require new assets and existing assets modified after 
July 1, 2024, to use best available techniques (BAT) and meet best 
environmental practice (BEP) assessment criteria for water treatment. 
These are designed to ensure that an asset meets the most stringent of 
either local requirements or our own standards.
For offshore operations, our standards prohibit the discharge to sea of 
non-aqueous drilling fluids such as oil-based muds and synthetic-based 
muds. Discharge of drilling cuttings to sea is only allowed subject to 
conditions such as distance to shore, expected dispersion of solids and 
if the concentration of certain substances is below specified limits. 
Our standards prohibit the use of mineral oil or diesel non-aqueous 
drilling fluids when drilling through aquifers or other beneficial use 
water-bearing zones.
See "Water stewardship" on page 395 for information about our water 
consumption standards.

Soil and groundwater
Under normal operating conditions, our assets are designed to avoid 
emissions and discharges to soil or groundwater. However, there is 
potential for unintentional contamination to occur for reasons such 
as operational failure, accidents, unusual corrosion or third-party 
interference including theft or sabotage. 
Our standards on process safety prescribe technical standards and 
operating practices designed to prevent losses of containment and 
to prevent escalation and mitigate impacts should an incident occur. 
Our standards on emergency response are designed to ensure that 
we are appropriately prepared to respond to all credible emergency 
and worst-case spill scenarios.
See "Safety" on page 429 for information about our standards on 
process safety and emergency response.
Our standards on soil and groundwater apply to assets, projects 
or businesses under Shell's operational control. We apply similar 
requirements to divested sites where Shell retains responsibility for 
managing soil and groundwater issues.
Our standards require our assets, projects or businesses to proactively 
assess and manage soil- and groundwater-related impacts and risks. 
This includes requirements to carry out soil and groundwater 
assessments on a regular basis and to determine whether any 
investigation, control or remedial action is required. Our standards 
require known or suspected releases to soil and groundwater to be 
investigated, assessed and, depending on the outcome of a risk 
assessment, remediated. 
For assets deemed to be at higher risk for soil and groundwater 
contamination, our standards require a groundwater monitoring 
plan, including an annual monitoring programme and the design of 
appropriate systems. For sites where benzene or ether oxygenates are 
present or suspected, we apply additional monitoring, control and 
remediation measures.
In line with site-level assessments, our standards require our assets, 
projects or businesses to develop a remedial action plan documenting 
the actions to be taken to address potential soil and groundwater 
contamination.
Product stewardship
Our approach to product stewardship aims to make sure our products 
are safe throughout the life cycle. We also manage the use of 
hazardous substances and materials in our operations to minimise 
harm to people or the environment.
Product safety
Our standards require our assets, projects or businesses to identify, 
assess and manage hazards and risks associated with our products 
throughout the life cycle, from development, product handling, storage 
and transport to final disposal. As part of this process, we implement 
measures to prevent and mitigate actual or potential health, safety or 
environmental impacts. Our standards require re-evaluating existing 
products when entering a new market, altering a product's formulation 
or manufacturing, or when new health, safety, environmental or 
regulatory information becomes known. 
We communicate the hazards and requirements to manage the risks 
of our products to customers, employees, contractors and authorities 
through product safety data sheets and product hazard labels.
These standards apply to products such as fuels, lubricants and 
chemicals. 
Hazardous substances and materials in our operations
Our standards require our assets, projects or businesses to identify, 
assess and manage the hazards and risks associated with substances 
and materials used in our operations. As part of this process, we 
evaluate hazards associated with the use, storage, transport and 
disposal of substances and materials and implement controls to 
prevent and mitigate actual or potential health, safety or 
environmental impacts. 
Our standards require a systematic approach to evaluating and 
managing hazards associated with purchased products through 
a chemical and product approval process.
We communicate the hazards and requirements to manage the 
risks of hazardous substances in our operations to employees, 
contractors and authorities through product safety data sheets, 
product inventories, product hazard labels and other health, safety 
and environmental information. 
Animal testing
Global chemical safety regulations require animal testing to assess the 
risks of new products. We aim to replace animal testing with suitable 
alternatives while continuing to innovate, develop and maintain new 
and safe products and technologies.
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to apply a 
hierarchy of controls to replace animal tests with alternatives where 
possible, to reduce the number of animals used and to refine test 
methods to make them as humane as possible. When animal testing 
is required by regulation, our standards require controls to ensure 
that stringent animal welfare standards are followed.
See shell.com for our Animal Welfare Report.
Other policies
See "Impact assessment" on page 355, "Water (E3)" on page 395, 
"Resource use and circular economy (E5)" on page 404 and "Safety" 
on page 429 for information about other standards relevant to 
pollution control.
Actions and resources related to pollution (E2-2)
In 2024, we took action to reduce our air emissions, manage our water 
discharges and improve our performance on air and water quality. We 
continued to manage soil and groundwater and product stewardship in 
line with existing standards and procedures.
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable. 
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
Air quality
We follow our own standards and those of local regulators to manage 
airborne pollutants, including emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur 
oxides and volatile organic compounds.
Sustainability Statements | Environment | E2 Pollution continued
392 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 395 ----
In 2024, we continued to implement leak detection and repair 
programmes to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, 
with a focus on sources of VOC emissions exceeding 100 tonnes per 
year. We also continued to implement greenhouse gas improvement 
opportunities, which often reduce emissions of other air pollutants. For 
example, reducing site power generation or routine flaring can lower 
greenhouse gas emissions, as well as volatile organic compounds, 
NOX and SOX. 
Water quality
We follow our own standards and those of local regulators to manage 
waste-water discharges.
In 2024, we continued to embed our refreshed approach to water 
management in our operations, based on water stewardship principles. 
In some offshore assets, such as our Prelude floating LNG facility in 
Australia, our UK assets in the North Sea and our deep-water assets in 
the Gulf of America, we are implementing programmes to further assess 
waste-water discharges in response to new regulations. 
We continue to participate in industry consortia to develop tools and 
methodologies to improve the management of waste-water discharges.
See "Water stewardship" on page 395 for more information about our 
approach to managing water. 
Soil and groundwater
Shell operates a global soil and groundwater programme comprising 
an in-house team and experienced consultants who support Shell 
businesses to understand, assess and manage their soil and 
groundwater risks. 
We have an active research and development programme that helps 
develop best practice and we conduct scientific research on potential 
impacts associated with our activities. We often share our research 
findings with government agencies, researchers and other stakeholders 
to support the development of sustainable and risk-based 
environmental guidelines.
We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention of 
preventing spills. To minimise the risk of spills, Shell has routine 
programmes in place to help reduce failures and maintain the reliability 
of facilities and pipelines. See "Process safety" on page 431 for more 
information.
Product stewardship
We work to ensure our products — such as fuels, lubricants and 
chemicals — are safe throughout their life cycle. We carry out risk 
assessments for products and additives and publish and distribute 
safety data sheets to customers globally. 
Working through industry consortia, Shell conducts research and 
development on tools and methodologies to better identify, assess and 
manage risks to water, air and soil. This includes understanding the 
implications of new scientific research and emerging regulations on 
pollutants.
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant, 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to pollution control is 
supported by members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management function, which includes subject matter experts in impact 
assessment, air emissions, water, ecotoxicology, soil and groundwater, 
process safety, emergency response and other disciplines. The 
requirements of our standards are communicated to people involved 
with implementation through various mechanisms, including internal 
communication channels, management systems and training, as 
appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will to continue to:
￮manage air emissions, water discharges, soil and groundwater, and 
hazardous substances in line with own standards and those of local 
regulators;
￮ implement leak detection and repair programmes at large facilities 
to address emissions of volatile organic compounds; and
￮ work towards improving our asset integrity and process safety 
performance, a key factor in our spills performance. 
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets related to pollution (E2-3)
Emissions of pollutants to air and water during normal operating 
conditions are often subject to limits and permit conditions established 
by local regulators at the asset level, which establish the performance 
level to be achieved for any improvements between a base period and 
a future period. Due to the diversity of our operations and the different 
regulatory frameworks to which we are subject, we have not set 
consolidated targets at a Group level for specific air pollutants, 
emissions to water, pollution to soil or specific loads, substances of 
concern or substances of very high concern.
We measure the effectiveness of our policies and standards by 
monitoring our performance data and compliance with permit 
conditions. These efforts are supported by experts who monitor trends 
and provide technical advice to our operating assets.
Pollution of air, water and soil (E2-4)
This section describes our performance on air quality, water quality and 
spills in 2024. 
We present data on emissions to air and discharges to water against 
an operational control boundary. See "Supplementary data for 
pollution, water, biodiversity and waste, including estimates for non-
operated assets" on page 434-437 for data reported against an ESRS 
boundary.
Air quality
We gather data on emissions to air from the day-to-day running of our 
facilities. We work to minimise these emissions according to local 
regulatory requirements and our own standards.

[A] Emissions to air are defined as the total mass of pollutants emitted to the atmosphere. Data 
are calculated at site level and consolidated for assets under Shell's operational control. In 
the absence of local regulation or an approved voluntary scheme, the highest practical tier 
from the following hierarchy is used: continuous monitoring, periodic monitoring, derived 
emission factors based on monitoring over a range of conditions; engineering calculations; 
equipment manufacturer emission factors; or use of default or standard emission factors. 
When emission factors are used, reference information and guidance include the European 
Monitoring and Evaluation Programme, the European Environment Agency, Concawe, the 
American Petroleum Institute and the International Maritime Organization. There is a 
degree of measurement uncertainty arising from the number of emission points for which 
data are calculated and variations in the emission factors used at site level, which in some 
cases are governed by local regulation. As a result of these limitations, it is not possible to 
furnish a range of estimates with confidence.
[B] Includes reporting by facilities with emissions above the thresholds specified in the 
European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register regulation. Some facilities with emissions 
below these thresholds also submit data, particularly for SOX, NOX and VOCs. 
[C] PAH excludes naphthalene (C 10H8), which is reported separately. 
Our SOX emissions in 2024 decreased to 21 thousand tonnes from 31 
thousand tonnes in 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction 
in our flaring at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore and 
the Shell-operated Scotford Upgrader in Canada.
Our NOX emissions in 2024 increased to 92 thousand tonnes from 88 
thousand tonnes in 2023. The rise was partly driven by activity by 
facilities in Nigeria and logistics in the UK.
Our emissions of VOCs in 2024 were 32 thousand tonnes compared 
with 32 thousand tonnes in 2023 (restated from 36 thousand tonnes 
following a review of the performance data).
Our assets are often required by regulators to gather data on various 
air pollutants for local performance monitoring and reporting. In 2024, 
we began collecting data on several additional pollutants for certain 
assets. We intend to provide further contextual information in the future 
when additional comparative data are available.
Water quality
We gather data on pollutants in water returned to the environment 
from the day-to-day running of our facilities (referred to as "discharges 
to surface water"). We work to minimise these discharges according to 
local regulatory requirements and our own standards.

[A] Pollutants discharged to surface water are defined as the total mass of pollutants present 
in controlled or regulated effluent discharges to surface water directly from onshore assets. 
Figures are expressed on the basis of net discharge derived from measured concentrations 
and discharged effluent volumes. The scope includes pollutants discharged through 
produced water, process water, oil or water interceptors, cooling water and boiler blow-
down water. It excludes oil spills, pollutants in water injected in reservoirs, quantities 
discharged to third-party treatment facilities and surface run-off water.
[B] Data on pollutants discharged to surface water are calculated at site level and 
consolidated for assets under Shell's operational control. In the absence of a locally 
required analysis method, the reported pollutants are analysed in samples taken from 
representative streams such as treated process water using pollutant-specific 
methodologies based on the American Public Health Association, the Royal Netherlands 
Standardization Institute and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
There is a degree of measurement uncertainty arising from effluent sampling and logistics, 
local analytical capabilities and applied methods, and from the determination of the 
effluent volumes. Standardisation will reduce such uncertainties, but as a result, it is 
currently not possible to furnish a range of estimates with confidence.
[C] Includes reporting by facilities with discharges above the thresholds specified in the 
European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register regulation. Some facilities with 
discharges below these thresholds may also submit data.
Our assets are required by regulators to gather data on various 
discharges to water for local performance monitoring and reporting. 
In 2024, we began collecting data at a Group level on several 
pollutants that were previously monitored at a local level. We intend 
to provide further contextual information in the future when additional 
comparative data are available.
Spills
See "Spills" on page 433 for metrics and commentary related to oil 
spills, including in Nigeria. Because of the importance of process safety 
to preventing losses of containment, and preventing escalation and 
mitigating impacts should an incident occur, spills data are placed in 
this section so that they can be viewed alongside related disclosures 
on process safety and emergency response.

Water and marine resources (E3)
Water is essential to life and is an important resource in many 
industrial processes. As an energy company we need water for our 
operations, and this can affect other water users.
Our double materiality assessment has identified fresh-water 
consumption, especially in water-stressed areas, as a material topic. 
See "Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with 
strategy and business model (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of 
the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
Shell's businesses consume water for a variety of uses. In 2024, around 
79 million cubic metres of fresh-water consumed was used for 
manufacturing oil products and chemicals (88%), with the remaining 11 
million cubic metres mainly used for oil and gas production. 
Our use of water can have impacts on ecosystems and people. 
Consumption of water by our business activities has the potential to 
cause physical changes to ecosystems, affecting habitats and species. 
In water-stressed areas, it can exacerbate existing pressure on 
ecosystems and lead to competition with communities and other water 
users. To help us manage these impacts, we are implementing water 
stewardship principles across our businesses and developing local 
improvement plans.
This section explains how Shell manages the sourcing, use, treatment 
and disposal of water. See "Pollution (E2)" on page 391 for information 
about our approach to water quality and soil and groundwater. See 
"Biodiversity and ecosystems (E4)" on page 397 for information about 
our approach to marine habitats.
Policies related to water and marine resources (E3-1)
Our approach to water is governed by our Safety, Environment and 
Asset Management (SEAM) Standards. These contain standards 
addressing water stewardship, management of discharges and the 
use of technology in our facilities, among other topics. See "SEAM 
Standards" on page 130 for more information.
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
Water stewardship
Our standards require our assets, projects or businesses to manage 
sourcing, use, treatment and disposal of water based on recognised 
water stewardship principles. Our standards are informed by external 
best practices, such as those developed by the Alliance for Water 
Stewardship.
The objective is to manage our use and sourcing of water in ways that 
are socially equitable, environmentally sustainable, economically 
beneficial and achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that 
involves site- and catchment-based actions, in line with a water 
stewardship management plan. Such plans help us to move away from 
a traditional inside-out approach focusing on our impact on the 
environment to an outside-in approach that considers how we impact, 
and are impacted by, the environment. They also help us to reduce 
consumption in water-stressed areas.
The water stewardship principles are applicable to fresh-water and 
marine environments. To account for the diversity of Shell's operations, 
we expect assets, projects or businesses to meet the intent of the 
principles by applying them to their local circumstances in a fit-for-
purpose way.
Water stewardship principles
 
Principles of water 
stewardship What this means for Shell
Adopt good water 
governance
Responsible sharing of water resources in a 
watershed or catchment of relevance through 
engagements with stakeholders such as industry 
associations, local authorities, collective water 
action networks and other users.
Implement a sustainable 
water balance
Withdraw sustainable amounts of fresh water from 
the catchment, taking into consideration current 
and future users. Consider recycling and reusing 
fresh water and taking water efficiency measures. 
Ensure good water quality Good water quality refers to water that meets the 
needs of native flora and fauna and people. This 
applies to surface water, groundwater and the 
marine environment. Shell contributes to this 
objective by managing effluent discharges.
Focus on important water-
related areas
Consider mitigation actions if business activities 
within the catchment impact important water-
related areas of high value to nature or people.
Ensure safe water, 
sanitation and hygiene 
(WASH) for all 
WASH refers to efforts to address basic human 
water needs and rights related to access to safe 
and sufficient water for drinking and sanitation. In 
contexts where WASH provision is lacking, Shell 
may support provision for employees, customers 
and communities.
For new projects, we undertake environmental and social impact 
assessments to identify measures to avoid or minimise impacts on 
water. We evaluate the long-term sustainability of water resources to 
select options that avoid or minimise disruption to the environment and 
other users. This helps to ensure we have a continued supply of water 
for our operations, while also minimising impacts and bringing benefits 
to others. See "Impact assessment" on page 355 for more information.
See "Water quality" on page 393 for information about our standards 
on prevention and abatement of water pollution.
Shell is not a producer of biological or non-biological marine resources 
such as deep-sea minerals or seafood products. Accordingly, we have 
not adopted standards on these topics.
Our approach to promoting sustainable oceans and seas is covered by 
our standards on biodiversity, water stewardship and pollution control.
Actions and resources related to water and marine 
resources (E3-2)
Our actions in 2024 focused on embedding water stewardship 
management plans in applicable operations, with an emphasis on 
reducing fresh-water consumption in water-stressed areas.
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.

Water stewardship management plans
Our assets, projects or businesses are required to implement water 
stewardship principles by developing and implementing water 
stewardship management plans in accordance with our SEAM 
Standards.
Since 2021, we have conducted water stewardship assessments at 
18 assets across different businesses and regions, with a priority on 
operations in areas of high water stress and those that use significant 
quantities of fresh water. The insights gained from these assessments 
have moved us towards a more holistic stewardship approach. This 
goes beyond only focusing on water use to also considering factors 
such as water footprint, regional water stress, water quality, 
catchments, governance and stakeholder engagement. Building on 
these efforts, our Mobility and US Midstream businesses developed 
water stewardship plans in 2024. 
Areas of high water stress
In 2024, we continued to make progress in reducing our consumption 
of fresh water in water-stressed areas, which we classify in accordance 
with World Resources Institute definitions, subject to the qualifications 
set out below.
In 2018, we assessed four facilities as being located in areas of high 
water stress, based on the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and the 
materiality of contribution to total fresh-water consumption in such 
areas. These included the Pearl GTL gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar; the 
Shell Import Facility in Tabangao in the Philippines; and the Shell 
Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore, which comprises integrated 
refining and chemical assets on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island. 
Although Singapore was subsequently reclassified by the Aqueduct 
Water Risk Atlas as being at low overall water stress, we continue to 
treat the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park as part of a water-stressed 
region, based on our original 2018 assessment. 
In 2024, the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore 
commissioned a waste-water recovery project that resulted in a further 
reduction of fresh-water withdrawal rates. In 2024, Shell reached an 
agreement to sell its interest in the Energy and Chemicals Park 
Singapore. This transaction is expected to be completed in 2025, 
subject to regulatory approvals.
Working with others
Shell collaborates with universities, technology providers and other 
energy companies to identify and develop opportunities to improve 
our water management performance. We work with other companies 
through Ipieca, the global oil and gas industry association for 
advancing environmental and social performance across the energy 
transition, to support the development of water risk assessment tools 
to improve the way companies define, assess and respond to water-
related risks. Our collaboration priorities focus on the practical 
implementation of water stewardship principles and the development 
and adoption of technology solutions for sustainable water 
management. These activities concern impacts related to water 
consumption and water quality.
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant, 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to water is supported 
by members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
function, which includes subject matter experts in impact assessment, 
water management, ecotoxicology and other disciplines. The 
requirements of our standards are communicated to people involved 
with implementation through various mechanisms, including internal 
communication channels, management systems and training, as 
appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮manage water consumption and quality in line with our own 
standards and those of local regulators;
￮ embed water stewardship management plans; and
￮ engage with external stakeholders and industry peers on water-
related issues. 
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets related to water and marine resources (E3-3)
In 2021, we set a voluntary commitment to reduce our consumption 
of fresh water by 15% by 2025 compared with 2018 levels in areas 
where there is high fresh-water stress. We achieved this commitment 
ahead of time in 2022. Shell's commitment meets the ESRS definition 
of a target.
In 2024, our consumption of fresh water in areas of high water stress 
was 16 million cubic metres compared with 25 million cubic metres in 
the base year of 2018, a 36% reduction over the period.  The reduction 
was mainly the result of a net decrease in water consumption at the 
Pearl GTL facility in Qatar, the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park 
Singapore and the Shell Import Facility in Tabangao in the Philippines, 
and reflects a combination of hardware changes, improvements in 
operating practices and the conversion of Tabangao from a refinery 
to a terminal. This level of progress is consistent with our expectations 
when setting the commitment.
The scope of this commitment covers the four facilities that account for 
most of our consumption of fresh water in water-stressed areas. The 
adoption of this commitment responds to emerging scientific evidence 
about water-stressed areas and stakeholder concerns about our 
potential impact on such areas. We have not adopted targets for 
commodities related to marine resources as we consider this topic to 
have limited relevance for our business.
Water consumption (E3-4)
Our water performance data for 2024 are presented below.
We present data for water consumption against an operational control 
boundary. See "Supplementary data for pollution, water, biodiversity 
and waste, including estimates for non-operated assets" on page 435 
for water consumption data reported against a financial control 
boundary.

Changes in water storage —
[A] Water volumes are reported at site level using one or more of the following methods: 
metering; water bills from public utilities; pumping capacity multiplied by the time of 
pumping; and process requirement estimates. Due to the site-specific nature of these 
calculations, it is not possible to state a degree of measurement uncertainty with 
confidence.
[B] Fresh water figures do not include once-through cooling water
[C] Water consumption is defined as fresh water withdrawn minus fresh water discharged. 
Where "fresh water" is not defined by local regulation, below 2,000 mg/l total dissolved 
solids is used. Fresh water generally includes water from public utilities, water wells, lakes, 
ponds, streams and rivers. 
[D] Areas of high water stress are areas where the ratio of water demand and water 
availability is high or extremely high in the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool of the World 
Resources Institute. We assess four material facilities as located in areas of high water 
stress: Pearl GTL in Qatar; the Shell Import Facility at Tabangao in the Philippines; and the 
Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore, which comprises integrated refining and 
chemical assets on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island. Figures include reporting by a small 
number of assets in water-stressed areas which make an immaterial contribution to total 
water consumption in water-stressed areas.
[E] Water recycled and reused is the volume of fresh water used in more than one process or 
more than once before final treatment and/or discharge to the environment. It does not 
include water used in re-circulating cooling towers, nor non-fresh water used, such as sea 
water or brackish surface water and groundwater. 
[F] Water stored means water continuously collected in containment structures. This is 
typically the last stage of processing where the water is managed by passive evaporation. 
The water may include treated or untreated associated water or rainwater.
Biodiversity and ecosystems (E4)
Our activities can affect natural habitats and the communities that 
depend on them. We seek to have a positive impact on biodiversity.
Our double materiality assessment has identified biodiversity loss, 
sensitive areas and species, and ecosystem services as material topics. 
See "Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with 
strategy and business model (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of 
the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
We recognise the urgency to protect and enhance biodiversity 
and ecosystem services. The links between nature and climate are 
recognised in the UN Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity 
Framework of 2022 and successive meetings of the Conference of 
the Parties under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
We also acknowledge the important links between biodiversity 
and communities.
Our business activities have the potential to contribute directly 
or indirectly to drivers of biodiversity loss such as climate change, 
pollution, land use change, fresh-water use change and sea use 
change. They also have the potential to impact critical habitats and 
other biodiversity sensitive areas, and to contribute to changes from 
natural to modified habitats, which can affect the quality or availability 
of ecosystem services used by local communities. We seek to minimise 
our impact on nature through operating standards that address 
biodiversity and other aspects of environmental performance.
Our business activities depend on ecosystem services such as provision 
of fresh water and natural resources, and benefits obtained from the 
natural processes and functioning of ecosystems, such as climate and 
flood regulation and erosion control. 
We are still at an early stage of understanding how these issues may 
affect our business in the future, including with respect to our value chain. 
This section explains how Shell manages impacts on biodiversity and 
ecosystems, critical habitats and deforestation. See "Climate change 
(E1)" on page 364, "Pollution (E2)" on page 391, "Water and marine 
resources (E3)" on page 395 and "Resource use and circular economy 
(E5)" on page 404 for information about our approach to other 
environmental topics relevant to biodiversity. 
Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and 
ecosystems in strategy and business model (E4-1)
Shell businesses operate within land and marine ecosystems. For 
example, we need access to land for onshore operations such as 
oil and gas production, refineries, chemical plants, pipelines, retail 
facilities, and electricity generation and storage. We need access 
to marine areas for oil and gas production, pipelines, carbon capture 
and storage, wind power generation, marine terminals and shipping. 
Our operations also use natural resources such as fresh water.
Our ability to develop new projects and opportunities depends in part 
on our ability to meet the expectations of regulators, communities and 
other stakeholders for managing our impact on biodiversity.
Our dependencies on nature will change as we progress in the energy 
transition. For example, our biofuel activities depend on access to land 
and availability of natural resources such as soil and water and the 
regulating ecosystem services they provide. Our nature-based solution 
activities depend on access to land as well as the supporting ecosystem 
services needed to capture CO2 and enhance biodiversity.
We manage biodiversity in our operations through our operating 
standards and environmental management systems. We also work with 
peers through organisations like Ipieca, the global oil and gas industry 
association for advancing environmental and social performance 
across the energy transition, to deepen our understanding of the 
industry's impacts on biodiversity and to develop best practices. 
Considering the integrated approach of our strategy, and how 
our approach to identifying and managing biodiversity impacts is 
embedded within it, we have not yet carried out a comprehensive 
assessment of the resilience of our strategy and business model 
specifically in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems as set out 
under the ESRS. We aim to undertake further work to deepen 
our understanding. See "Respecting nature" on page 109-113
for further information.
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 
SBM-3)
We provide a consolidated list of sites in biodiversity sensitive areas 
in the table "Sites impacting biodiversity sensitive areas" on pages 
398-400.This table is prepared by undertaking geospatial analysis 
of the overlap between Shell's operated asset footprint and mapped 
biodiversity sensitive areas (BSAs). To identify these areas, we use the 
World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA), maintained by the UN 
Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre 
(UNEP-WCMC), and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas 
(WDKBA), maintained by BirdLife International. 
The BSAs used or applied in the assessment include UNESCO World 
Heritage Sites, the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, key 
biodiversity areas and other protected areas. The latter encompass 
Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance, UNESCO Man and the 
Biosphere Reserves, areas designated under regional agreements such 
as OSPAR and Emerald Network, as well as nationally designated 
areas reported as International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) Management Category I–IV in the UNEP-WCMC WDPA.

---- Page 400 ----
Certain areas have multiple BSA designations with defined 
conservation objectives that may target different species or habitats. 
We analyse all applicable designations and their associated 
geographic areas and list them in the table accordingly.
Owing to the large number of operated assets that potentially 
impact biodiversity sensitive areas, uncertainties in interpreting 
ESRS requirements, and various data limitations, we apply judgement 
in consolidating sites by country and provide an indication of the 
business activities impacting the areas listed in the table. 
Our assessment includes Shell sites under operational control, 
excluding our retail network and real estate locations, which generally 
have less potential for negative impact on BSAs due to their size, the 
nature of their activity and because they are often located in urban and 
developed areas.
 Our analysis is based on global datasets and may exclude other 
nationally designated sites that have not been submitted to the WDPA 
or WDKBA. Due to the setup of this analysis, it does not yield data on 
all site-specific impacts and dependencies on, or the ecological status 
of, all BSAs. We aim to undertake further work on site-level impacts 
and dependencies and approaches to defining ecological status with 
reference to specific ecosystem baseline levels.
We assess land use change as a material impact. On a stand-alone 
basis, we do not assess land degradation, desertification or soil sealing 
as material impacts at a Group level. Some of our operations take 
place in locations where they may affect threatened species. 
See "Supplementary data for pollution, water, biodiversity and waste, 
including estimates for non-operated assets" on page 437 for 
estimated information about joint operations not under operational 
control impacting biodiversity sensitive areas.

[F] QGC's LNG Plant on Curtis Island is present within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Site (declared in 1981). Construction was undertaken by BG Group in 2010, and the plant was 
operational at the time of Shell's acquisition in 2016. Approval for the development of the plant was granted by the Australian Government and the operations are regulated by both the state 
and federal governments.
[G] The Wadden Sea World Heritage Site was inscribed in 2009. Shell undertook exploration activities in the area during the 1960s, and since 2007, natural gas has been produced from under 
the Wadden Sea World Heritage Site. Production takes place from the land outside the boundary of the designated World Heritage Site and is regulated by the Dutch government.
Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-2)
Our approach to biodiversity and ecosystems is governed by our 
Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards. 
These contain standards related to avoiding adverse impacts on 
biodiversity and ecosystems, applying the mitigation hierarchy, 
achieving net positive impact on biodiversity in critical habitats and net-
zero deforestation. Our standards apply to land and marine 
environments, unless otherwise stated. See "SEAM Standards" 
on page 130 for more information.
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
World Heritage Sites 
Shell does not explore for or develop oil and gas resources in natural 
or mixed World Heritage Sites. We do not enter into joint ventures 
unless they comply with this requirement. 
Biodiversity and ecosystem management
Our standards require our assets, projects and businesses to avoid 
negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and where 
avoidance is not achievable, to mitigate negative impacts following the 
mitigation hierarchy. The mitigation hierarchy is a sequence of actions 
to anticipate and avoid impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
It prioritises avoidance, and, where this is not possible, minimisation of 
impacts, followed by rehabilitation and restoration, and where 
significant residual impacts remain, the use of offsets.
Sustainability Statements | Environment | Biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) continued
400 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 403 ----
Critical habitats
When undertaking a project in a critical habitat, we aim to go beyond 
compensating for a residual adverse impact to deliver an overall 
conservation gain or net positive impact to biodiversity.
Critical habitats are specific areas of high biodiversity value in which 
receptors are particularly sensitive to development. We apply the same 
definition of critical habitats as the International Finance Corporation. 
Our standards require all projects located in a critical habitat to 
develop and implement a biodiversity action plan that sets out the 
actions needed to follow the mitigation hierarchy and the actions 
designed to achieve a net positive impact. Such plans are required to 
include clear objectives, milestones and indicators to monitor progress.
Net positive impact on biodiversity in the context of projects is an 
outcome in which the impacts on biodiversity caused by the project are 
outweighed by the actions taken to avoid and reduce such impacts, 
rehabilitate affected species and/or landscapes and offset any 
residual impacts.
Deforestation and reforestation
Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses. 
Our aim is to avoid deforestation in line with the mitigation hierarchy 
as referenced above. Where avoidance cannot be achieved, we seek 
to implement reforestation plans that include measures to achieve net-
zero deforestation while maintaining biodiversity and conservation 
value. This standard addresses our commitment to net-zero 
deforestation which commenced in 2022.
Our standards require our assets, projects and businesses to avoid 
deforestation, and where avoidance is not achievable, to implement 
a reforestation plan. Reforestation of at least the same area of an 
equivalent forest is required to ensure that biodiversity and 
conservation values are restored. This requirement is intended 
to address our contribution to land use change.
In line with the definition of forest used by the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, our commitment to net-zero 
deforestation as embedded in our standards applies to land spanning 
more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than five metres and a canopy 
cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. 
It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or 
urban land use. 
Biodiversity management in nature-based solutions
Shell buys high-quality carbon credits generated by projects that 
protect nature and restore the environment. We also invest directly 
in projects to increase the supply of carbon credits and help meet 
demand from customers.
Our standards require Shell-funded nature-based projects or activities 
that protect, enhance or restore natural ecosystems to generate carbon 
credits to achieve accreditation from a standard or regulation that 
delivers net positive impact on biodiversity. Net positive impact in this 
context means that a project's net impacts on biodiversity in the project 
zone are positive, compared with the biodiversity conditions under the 
without-project land use scenario over the project lifetime. Our 
standards require such projects to meet the Climate, Community and 
Biodiversity Standards (CCB), an equivalent standard, or compliance 
with local legislation to deliver net positive impact on biodiversity. 
Sourcing of biocomponents
Shell only sources renewable components or feedstocks for low-
carbon fuels that meet our standards for human rights, animal care 
and welfare principles, and protection of areas with high-carbon stock 
or of high biodiversity value, as set out in our policy on sourcing of 
biocomponents. See "Sourcing of biocomponents" on page 405 
for more information.
How our policies contribute to biodiversity
Our environmental, social and safety standards are designed to 
work together to reduce negative impacts on nature, ecosystems 
and people. Some of our standards, such as those related to pollution, 
directly address drivers of biodiversity loss and the state of species 
and ecosystems. Others operate indirectly by targeting aspects of 
our activities which may contribute to those drivers, such as land use 
change or ecosystem services. Because our standards are designed 
to work in an integrated manner to achieve outcomes that are 
appropriate for the local environment, they do not necessarily 
specify all the potential impact drivers.
Other policies
See "Impact assessment" on page 355 for information about our 
approach to impact assessment.

Other disclosures on policies
Shell's standards on biodiversity cover World Heritage Sites, 
biodiversity and ecosystem management, critical habitats, 
deforestation and reforestation, biodiversity in nature-based solutions 
projects and sourcing of biocomponents. We have not adopted 
overarching biodiversity and ecosystem protection standards covering 
operational sites owned, leased or managed in or near a biodiversity 
sensitive area, though our standards on World Heritage Sites, 
biodiversity and ecosystem management, and critical habitats address 
relevant aspects.
Shell has not adopted specific standards on sustainable land and 
agriculture. Our exposure to these issues arises in the context of 
sourcing of feedstocks for biofuels. Our sourcing of biocomponents 
policy includes specific consideration of sustainable land use by 
ensuring we do not source renewable components or feedstocks that 
have been associated with the clearing of areas with high carbon stock 
or high biodiversity value. See "Sourcing of biocomponents" on page 
405 for more information.
Our approach to sustainable oceans and seas is covered by our 
environmental, social and safety standards, which apply to land and 
marine environments. See "Deforestation and reforestation" on page 
401 for information about our standards on deforestation.
Actions and resources related to biodiversity and 
ecosystems (E4-3)
Our actions in 2024 focused on implementing our refreshed standards 
on biodiversity and ecosystems, with activities located in critical 
habitats and forest habitats as key priorities.
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
Critical habitats
We seek to avoid impacts on critical habitats. Where avoidance is not 
possible, we aim to mitigate and compensate for our impact based on 
the mitigation hierarchy.
Our standards require new projects located in critical habitats to 
develop a biodiversity action plan. This sets out the actions needed to 
follow the mitigation hierarchy and to achieve a net positive impact 
on biodiversity.

Projects in critical habitats 62
Projects in critical habitats with an approved biodiversity action 
plan and net positive impact programme in place [C] 61
[A] Data on projects in critical habitats are not directly comparable with the table "Sites 
impacting biodiversity sensitive areas" on pages 398-400. This is primarily due to 
differences in the definition of a "site" and "project" for reporting purposes. The definition 
used for biodiversity sensitive area includes only designated protected areas included in 
the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and the World Database of Key 
Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA). Not all critical habitats are gazetted protected areas and 
therefore may not be mapped in these global biodiversity datasets. It is possible for 
multiple critical habitats or biodiversity sensitive areas to overlap with an individual site. If 
a project is located in a critical habitat but not within a designated biodiversity sensitive 
area, it will not be included in the "Sites impacting biodiversity sensitive areas" table. 
Similarly, not all biodiversity sensitive areas meet the definition of critical habitat and 
therefore a site located in such an area is not required under our standards to prepare a 
biodiversity action plan.
[B] Includes Shell-operated projects in critical habitats for which the final investment decision 
was taken after February 11, 2021. Projects that subsequently become assets are included.
[C] A biodiversity action plan sets out actions to mitigate impacts and to conserve or enhance 
biodiversity. It identifies priority receptors and details of appropriate management actions, 
including an implementation plan to progress and deliver net positive impact. 
Examples of activities in development or under way in 2024 include:
￮ in partnership with a local university, we are executing an ecological 
restoration programme on Browse Island, Australia, to help eradicate 
invasive alien species, improve reef health and promote the return of 
breeding seabirds to enhance regional resilience; 
￮ on Príncipe Island, São Tomé and Príncipe, we helped implement a 
turtle conservation programme in partnership with a local 
conservation organisation; and
￮ in partnership with the Marine Alliance for Science and Technology 
for Scotland (MASTS), and its member institutions, including Scottish 
government stakeholders, we helped to set up a multi-year research 
programme to gain insights into the ecology of skates and sharks in 
Scottish waters to help develop effective conservation strategies.
Also in 2024, we continued to work with industry partners like Ipieca 
and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers and through 
partnerships with the International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) and Proteus Partners to share best practice on approaches to 
no net loss, net gain, net positive impact to biodiversity and how 
business can contribute in the future to global nature positive goals. 
Reforestation
Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses. We 
work with partners and stakeholders to develop plans tailored to each 
reforestation project.
There is typically a time lag between the deforestation of an area and 
the start of the replanting process, which can range from months to 
years. As a result, there is often a difference in the number of hectares 
deforested and the number of hectares replanted within a single 
reporting period. 
In 2024, around 214 hectares were deforested as a result of our 
activities. This occurred in Australia, Canada and Nigeria, where we 
are preparing for or implementing reforestation programmes in line 
with local plans. 
We reforested 54 hectares in 2024 in British Columbia, Canada, 
working in close partnership with the Doig River First Nation to reforest 
land that had been previously cleared by others in the 1950s. In 
addition, we also partnered with Swan River First Nation in Alberta 
to reforest 10 hectares of previously cleared agricultural land. 
Biodiversity offsets
Our efforts to achieve net positive impact in critical habitats and net-
zero deforestation may require the use of biodiversity offsets. Where 
relevant, our biodiversity action plans and reforestation plans include 
biodiversity offsets. Such plans include a description of the offsets and 
their aims, including area and offset type, standards applied, where 
required, and criteria and indicators used to monitor delivery. As our 
standards require application of the mitigation hierarchy with respect 
to biodiversity impacts at asset, business or project level, local 
information on biodiversity offsets may exist but is not collated at 
Group level. We aim to undertake further work to enhance our 
disclosures on our use of biodiversity offsets.
Collaborating with others
We contribute to programmes that develop best practices and contribute 
to deepening scientific understanding of biodiversity and ecosystems. 
We have a long history of working alongside global environmental 
partners. For example, as part of the IUCN Renewable Energy and 
Nature programme Phase 2, we work with the IUCN, industry and non-
governmental organisations to develop guidance for cumulative impact 
assessment, spatial planning, responsible sourcing and biodiversity 
enhancements in renewable projects. 
Shell is one of the industry partners supporting INSITE, an independent 
science programme examining the effects of man-made structures on 
the ecology of the North Sea. We also contribute to the Offshore 
Renewables Joint Industry Programme, a research programme aimed 
at improving understanding of the effects of offshore wind and other 
energy projects on the marine environment.
When undertaking impact assessments or developing biodiversity 
action plans or reforestation plans, we consult with stakeholders to 
incorporate local and indigenous knowledge and work in partnerships 
to implement these plans.
Sourcing of biocomponents
See "Renewable and waste-based biofuel feedstocks" on page 406 
for information about actions related to biocomponents.
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of the SEAM Standards relevant to biodiversity is 
supported by members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management function, which includes subject matter experts in impact 
assessment and biodiversity. The requirements of our standards are 
communicated to people involved with implementation through various 
mechanisms, including internal communication channels, management 
systems and training, as appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮manage biodiversity and ecosystems in line with our own standards 
and those of local regulators;
￮ develop and implement our biodiversity action plans and 
reforestation plans;
￮ enhance our processes for analysing biodiversity data; and
￮ work with external stakeholders and industry peers on biodiversity 
issues.

Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations 
or our own standards are subject to change. The actions given above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-4)
Our business activities and the ecosystems in which they are located 
are diverse. As a result, the nature of our impacts on biodiversity varies 
from location to location. We believe that local goals drive more 
appropriate outcomes than globally aggregated targets, which may or 
may not be applicable to every situation. For this reason, we have not 
set consolidated targets on biodiversity at a Group level. Instead, our 
site-specific biodiversity action plans and reforestation plans set 
priorities at a local level for specific objectives, such as net positive 
impact or net-zero deforestation. Such plans may specify a base 
year from which progress is measured.
We measure the effectiveness of our policies and standards by 
monitoring the implementation of our biodiversity requirements. 
We track progress on implementing biodiversity action plans and 
reforestation plans at regular intervals. These efforts are supported by 
specialist teams that monitor internal and external trends and provide 
technical advice to our operating assets.
Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems 
change (E4-5)
Due to the diversity of our operations, the ecosystems in which they 
are located and different ways in which our activities may impact 
biodiversity, our monitoring and measurement have a strong local 
focus. We continue to monitor the development of external frameworks 
for corporate-level reporting on biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Our sites located in biodiversity sensitive areas are shown below.
Sites located in biodiversity sensitive areas (operational 
control) [A] [B] [C] [D]
unit 2024
Number of sites number 47
Total area hectares 4,804
[A] A site is a defined geographical area in which Shell business operations take place. A site 
may consist of one or more facilities or one or more geological fields with associated 
production and utility facilities. A site generally corresponds to the business accountability 
of an operations manager or production unit manager.
[B] Biodiversity sensitive areas include UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Natura 2000 
network of protected areas, key biodiversity areas and other protected areas including 
Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance, UNESCO Man–Biosphere Reserves, areas 
designated under regional agreements, as well as nationally designated areas reported as 
IUCN Management Category I-IV.
[C] Includes sites located within designated biodiversity sensitive areas. It is not yet possible to 
provide consolidated information on sites "near" biodiversity sensitive areas due to 
incomplete availability of information at a Group level about whether and how our 
activities may affect such areas. We aim to undertake further work to enhance our 
understanding.
[D] If a project is located in a critical habitat but not within a designated biodiversity sensitive 
area, it is not included in this table or in the table "Sites impacting biodiversity sensitive 
areas". See Footnote [A] to the table "Projects in critical habitats with biodiversity action 
plans" on page 403 for information.
Deforestation is one of the causes of land use change. We monitor 
progress on reforestation for sites under Shell's operational control, 
consistent with our commitment to net-zero deforestation. Our progress 
on reforestation for sites under Shell's operational control is shown below.
Deforestation and reforestation (operational control) [A]
hectares
2024
Total area deforested [B] 214
Total area replanted [C] 64
[A] Includes total area deforested and reforested by Shell-operated projects and activities 
within the reporting period.
[B] The scope is limited to forests as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations. 
[C] Replanting hectares are counted as soon as seedlings are planted in the ground.
There is typically a time lag between the deforestation of an area and 
the start of the replanting process, which can range from months to 
years. As a result, there is often a difference in the number of hectares 
deforested and the number of hectares replanted within a single 
reporting period. Since 2022, when our net-zero deforestation 
commitment commenced, we have deforested 506 hectares and 
reforested 65 hectares. All sites where deforestation has occurred have 
reforestation plans in place or under development. See "Deforestation 
and reforestation" on page 401 for more information.
We aim to continue to explore options to enhance our biodiversity 
metrics in the future.
Resource use and circular economy (E5)
As part of our respecting nature ambition, we seek to use resources 
efficiently and to increase reuse and recycling.
Our double materiality assessment has identified waste management 
as a material topic. See "Material impacts, risks and opportunities and 
their interaction with strategy and business mode (SBM-3)" on page 
351 and "Description of the process to identify and assess material 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more 
information.
Why it matters
Shell's business consumes resources and materials while producing 
energy and non-energy products for our customers. Our activities also 
generate waste, which must be managed appropriately to avoid harm 
to people or the environment. We are improving local practices by 
prioritising waste prevention, reuse and recycling over energy 
recovery and disposal.
Fossil fuels are based on a non-renewable natural resource which is 
combusted at the point of consumption. Such products are linear by 
nature. We are exploring options to reduce our use of resources, 
improve efficiency and recycling, and offer products that incorporate 
circular principles in those parts of our business where it is possible 
to do so.
Shell purchases biocomponents to produce biofuels, lubricants and 
chemicals, blend into fuels or to trade. Certain biofuel feedstocks have 
the potential for negative impacts in areas such as human rights, 
biodiversity or the release of carbon into the atmosphere. We adopt 
policies and procedures to prevent and mitigate these potential impacts.

Policies related to resource use and circular economy 
(E5-1)
Our approach to resource use and circularity is governed by our 
Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards, 
except where otherwise stated. These contain standards for resource 
efficiency, waste management and circularity. They are designed 
to increase the use of secondary resources, sustainable sourcing 
and renewable resources. See "SEAM Standards" on page 130 
for more information.
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
Waste management
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to identify waste-
related impacts and to adopt waste management plans. Our objective 
is to make sure that collection, storage, transport and disposal of waste 
is carried out in accordance with applicable laws and Shell standards. 
Such plans document the legislative context, the quantities and types 
of waste generated, waste classification and management decision-
making processes, and all aspects of waste handling from collection 
and storage to transport and final disposal. We apply a waste 
management hierarchy that aims to prevent or reduce waste at source 
as the most preferred option, followed by reuse, recycling, energy 
recovery and treatment and disposal.
When disposing of hazardous waste, our standards require the use of 
disposal sites that meet internationally recognised standards for waste 
management facilities, as verified by subject matter experts.
We seek to minimise the movement of hazardous waste across 
international borders. When such movement cannot be avoided, our 
standards require us to verify compliance with the Basel Convention on 
the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and 
their Disposal.
Our waste management standards are applied throughout the project 
life cycle from construction and operation to decommissioning. When 
developing new assets, we undertake impact assessments to identify 
measures to avoid or minimise waste-related impacts. When 
decommissioning assets, we seek to maximise reuse, repurposing and 
recycling of materials.
Some Shell businesses have adopted waste management policies 
specific to their business. For example, our Renewables and Energy 
Solutions business has adopted a ban on the use of landfills for 
disposing of wind turbine blades. This policy applies to new projects 
undertaken after 2022 as well as to certain existing projects 
undertaken before 2022 for which decommissioning is expected 
within the next decade.
Circular economy
In 2024, Shell introduced a new requirement within the SEAM 
Standards for our assets, projects or businesses to develop strategies 
to identify circularity-related risks and opportunities. This requirement 
aims to encourage the development of fit-for-purpose objectives and 
strategies based on the principles of rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, 
recycle and repair. The intent of this standard is to accelerate progress 
on our ambition to use resources and materials efficiently and to 
increase reuse and recycling.
Sourcing of biocomponents 
Our approach to sourcing renewable components and feedstock is 
governed by our policy on sustainable sourcing of biocomponents. This 
policy applies to all feedstocks regardless of origin. Its aim is to ensure 
that we do not source renewable components or feedstocks that have 
been associated with a potential violation of human rights, animal care 
and welfare principles and/or clearing of areas with high carbon stock 
or of high biodiversity value.
The policy requires new feedstock type and country combinations to 
be subject to a risk assessment covering key environmental and social 
criteria, including human rights, prior to an agreement to procure. 
Identified risks are mitigated through measures such as certification 
by recognised sustainability standards (including chain of custody 
traceability and sustainable production elements) and the inclusion 
of mandatory contract clauses. The policy requires suppliers to 
demonstrate alignment with human rights and environmental 
requirements, which are incorporated in our contractual agreements.
This policy requires palm oil, Latin American soy, sugar-cane 
derivatives, and forestry products and residues to be certified through 
recognised voluntary schemes. It prohibits the use of any crude palm oil 
or palm oil derivatives as a feedstock for the production of low-carbon 
fuels in our operations. 
The scope of this policy applies to components and feedstocks 
procured by Shell companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the 
operator. Non-operated joint ventures determine their own policies.
Other policies
See "Impact assessment" on page 355, "Greenhouse gas and energy 
management plan" on page 369 and "Water stewardship" on page 
395 for information about other policies relevant to resource use and 
waste management.
Actions and resources related to resource use and circular 
economy (E5-2)
In 2024, we continued to make improvements in our approach to 
managing waste and circularity. We also continued to refine our 
approach to the sourcing of biocomponents. 
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
Waste and circularity
We are working to reduce waste and increase circularity in those parts 
of our business where it is possible to do so. In 2024, we concluded 
our aim for zero waste is technically unfeasible. We continue to 
improve waste and circularity plans at the asset level to drive fit-for-
purpose waste reduction and optimise local circular economies.
Since 2021, we have completed 26 detailed assessments across our 
businesses to better understand the types of waste we generate and 
identify options to increase circular approaches. Using the results of 
these assessments, our assets are improving local waste management 
practices by prioritising waste prevention, reuse and recycling over 
energy recovery and disposal.

---- Page 408 ----
For example, at our Pearl GTL gas-to-liquids facility in Qatar, we have 
diverted waste to local cement kilns for use as clinker in cement 
production, thereby reducing use of raw materials and the amount of 
waste sent to landfill. Our Gulf of America operations are finding ways 
to reduce the disposal of unused chemicals, for example by testing and 
treating them so that they can be returned to the supplier for reuse. 
We are investigating options to reduce waste streams such as bio-
sludge, potentially contaminated soils and drilling fluids and cuttings. 
For example, at the Nyhamna gas plant in Norway, we send bio-
sludge to a local biogas facility, diverting it from landfill to generate 
electricity and for use as a soil fertiliser. 
At our Brazos wind farm upgrade in Texas, we sent decommissioned 
turbine blades in 2024 to be recycled for use as a component in 
construction materials. 
Our businesses and assets are developing strategies to improve 
circularity and to address risks and opportunities associated with our 
material flows. We developed four circularity strategies in 2024 which 
identified opportunities to increase the use of recycled materials in 
products and construction, eliminate single-use purchases, and design 
and select equipment that reduces waste generation. 
To build common understanding and progress the circular economy in 
the energy sector, Shell participates in circularity-related working 
groups of industry or business associations such as Ipieca, the global oil 
and gas association for advancing environmental and social 
performance across the energy transition; the European Chemical 
Industry Council (Cefic); and the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (WBCSD). We are also members of 
CHWMEG and the Canadian Waste Receiver Assessment Program, 
which help to assess waste disposal and recycling facilities on behalf of 
their members. 
Renewable and waste-based biofuel feedstocks
Shell aims to be a significant and profitable supplier of low-carbon fuels 
to help decarbonise harder-to-abate sectors including aviation, marine 
and commercial road transport.
We supply and trade low-carbon fuels such as biodiesel, bioethanol, 
renewable natural gas (also known as biogas or biomethane), 
renewable diesel (also known as hydrotreated vegetable oil or HVO) 
and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help lower the carbon emissions 
from transport. These fuels can be blended with existing fuels — such as 
diesel, petrol and aviation fuel — or used neat, and do not require 
costly investment in new infrastructure, which means they are a 
practical option for reducing transport emissions.
Shell and the non-operated joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 44%) 
are, together, one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of 
biofuels. Biofuels, along with natural gas, will play a key role in 
reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport.
In 2024, around 10.37 billion litres of biofuels (2023: 9.7 billion litres) 
were blended into Shell's sale of fuels worldwide, which includes the 
Shell share of sales made by Raízen. Raízen produced, on a 100% 
basis, around 3.16 billion litres of ethanol in 2024 (2023: 3.12 billion 
litres). 
To support our biofuel production capacity, we are developing multiple 
sourcing strategies for feedstocks. This includes purchases of feedstocks 
from third parties as well as equity production. 
In line with our biocomponents sourcing policy, the palm oil derivatives 
and waste, sugar cane and South American soy feedstock we purchase 
are certified under sustainability standards like the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Palm Oil, the International Sustainability and Carbon 
Certification, Bonsucro and the Round Table on Responsible Soy 
Association. We have also committed not to use crude palm oil or palm 
oil derivatives as a feedstock in Shell-operated assets producing 
biofuels or biogas.
Renewable natural gas (RNG), also known as biogas or biomethane, is 
gas derived from processing organic waste in a controlled environment 
until it is fully interchangeable with conventional natural gas. 
We are using local agricultural waste to grow Shell's RNG portfolio. 
Our acquisition of Nature Energy in 2023 supports our ambition to 
build a large-scale integrated RNG value chain to grow our low-carbon 
offerings across sectors. Nature Energy is one of the largest producers 
of RNG in Europe, and its main supply chains involve locally sourced 
agricultural waste. 
In the USA, we have two dairy manure-to-RNG facilities in operation, 
with a third under construction that is expected to become operational 
in 2025.
In July 2024, we announced that we had paused on-site construction 
work at the biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park 
Rotterdam in the Netherlands to assess the most commercial way 
forward for the project.
See "Biofuels" on page 58 for more information.
Plastics
Shell supports the need for improved circularity in the global plastics 
market. We encourage reduction, reuse and recycling of plastics and 
we are also a founding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, 
which helps governments to assess and improve waste collection and 
waste management. 
We are working with partners across the plastic waste value chain, 
such as the waste management industry and pyrolysis oil producers, 
to encourage the development of a more circular value chain.
Since 2019, Shell has been processing pyrolysis oil made from mixed 
plastic waste at the Shell Norco Energy and Chemicals Park in the 
USA. In 2024, we began production at our new pyrolysis oil upgrader 
at the Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk in the Netherlands. The upgrader 
improves the quality of pyrolysis oil, a liquid made from hard-to-recycle 
plastic waste, and turns it into chemical feedstock. The plant has the 
capacity to process up to 50,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil per year. 
Packaging
We continue to work towards our priority to increase recycled plastic in 
our packaging and ensure the packaging we use for our products is 
reusable or recyclable by design. 
In our Global Lubricants business, we continued to work with 
packaging suppliers to increase recycled plastic in our lubricant 
packaging. We are also using rewashed or rebottled bulk containers 
and reconditioned steel drums in select markets. And we collaborate 
with partners to produce and use fully recycled steel drums in 
Germany.
In our Mobility business, we continue to work with our suppliers for 
Shell-branded car care, food and drink products globally to increase 
packaging sustainability, which includes incorporating packaging 
sustainability elements in some tenders.

Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant, 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to circularity and waste 
is supported by members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management function, which includes subject matter experts in impact 
assessment and waste management. 
The Vice President for Sustainability is the most senior executive in Shell 
with accountability for the development, governance and oversight of 
Shell's policy on sourcing of biocomponents, with support from a cross-
business Renewable Components and Feedstock Sustainability 
Committee (RCFS). Leaders of business units that source 
biocomponents are responsible for compliance with the policy through 
their procurement focal points, with support from the Low Carbon 
Solutions sustainability team.
The requirements of our standards and policies are communicated to 
people involved with implementation through various mechanisms, 
including internal communication channels, management systems and 
training, as appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮ manage waste in line with our own standards and those of local 
regulators;
￮ support the implementation of our standards on circular economy;
￮ manage sourcing of biocomponents in line with our policy; and
￮ explore opportunities for reused or recycled feedstocks for the 
manufacture of chemicals and plastics.
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions listed above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets related to resource use and circular economy 
(E5-3)
Shell has set a priority to increase the amount of recycled plastic in 
Shell-branded packaging to 30% by 2030 and to ensure that the 
packaging we use for our products is reusable or recyclable by design. 
Shell's priority meets the ESRS definition of a target.
The scope of this priority includes Shell-branded primary packaging for 
our lubricants and non-fuel mobility products such as car care and food 
and drink. It excludes secondary and tertiary packaging; Shell-branded 
packaging of products manufactured, purchased and used by third 
parties; and-third party producers who make Shell products. 
Percentages for recycled plastic in Shell-branded packaging and for 
packaging that is reusable or recyclable are calculated using weight 
from purchasing specifications.
Recycled plastic content in packaging
By the end of 2024, we had achieved a level of 17% recycled plastic 
content by weight in Shell-branded plastic packaging compared with 
10% in the base year of 2022. This level of progress is consistent with 
our expectations when setting the priority.
Packaging classified as reusable or recyclable 
In 2024, we continued to meet our priority to ensure the packaging we 
use for our products is reusable or recyclable by design. In our 
Lubricants business, we maintained 99% total Shell-branded product 
packaging classified as reusable or recyclable by weight. Our Mobility 
business increased its use of reusable or recyclable packaging to 92% 
in 2024, compared with 79% in the base year of 2022. This level of 
progress is consistent with our expectations when setting the priority.
Other disclosures
Our post-consumer recycled material and reusable or recyclable 
packaging priorities respond to emerging scientific evidence on the 
impacts of plastic waste on the environment as well as to customer 
demand for increased circularity in packaging. By working towards 
these priorities, we increase our proportional use of recycled plastic 
and reduce our primary raw material use. These priorities relate to the 
recycling layer of the waste hierarchy. They have been adopted 
voluntarily, although as a global priority they also apply in jurisdictions 
that are adopting mandatory regulations.
Shell has not set consolidated targets for circular product design; 
minimisation of primary raw materials; sustainable sourcing and use of 
renewable resources in line with the cascading principle to use, reuse 
and recycle resources for as long as possible and at the highest value 
use per stage; waste management; or other matters related to resource 
use or the circular economy other than as set out above.
Resource outflows (E5-5)
Shell's outflows consist of our products as well as waste generated from 
our operations. 
Products
Shell produces and sells energy and non-energy products with varying 
levels of technical and economic potential to transition to more circular 
production processes. Energy products based on fossil fuels such as oil, 
natural gas and refined products are linear by nature, as they are 
based on a non-renewable natural resource which is combusted at the 
point of consumption. Chemicals based on hydrocarbon feedstocks 
have the potential to increase the use of recycled feedstocks as market 
incentives and technologies evolve. We are investing in biofuels, which 
have potential for circular production. 
Where relevant, Shell seeks to provide customers with non-fuel 
products that improve resource efficiency or incorporate circular 
principles by design. For example, we are the world's leading supplier 
of bitumen, one of the most recycled products in the construction 
industry. We have designed next-generation premium asphalts that last 
up to 20% longer than conventional polymer-modified bitumen. This 
can extend the service life of roads by up to three years. 
Shell also produces lubricants that can be recycled after use, excluding 
greases and applications where the lubricant is fully consumed in the 
use phase. Such lubricants can be re-refined through hydroprocessing 
to achieve the same quality as virgin base oils. In our catalyst 
manufacturing business, some of our catalysts are designed to be 
regenerated and reused by the customer to extend useful life. Precious 
metals in our catalysts are typically leased from third parties and 
reclaimed after use. 
Waste
Shell's operations generate non-hazardous and hazardous waste. Our 
drilling and production activities produce waste streams such as drilling 
fluid and cuttings, potentially contaminated soil, spent chemicals, brine 
water and septic waste. Our manufacturing operations produce waste 
streams such as bio-sludge, potentially contaminated soil, industrial 
waste water and spent catalysts. 
Sustainability Statements | Environment | Resource use and circular economy (E5) continued

---- Page 410 ----
These streams can include a variety of materials including metals, non-
metallic minerals and chemical substances. We aim to recycle catalysts 
containing rare earth elements and to reclaim catalysts containing 
precious metals. We also aim to regenerate to extend catalyst life and 
recycle to reduce disposal.
We present data below for waste against an operational control 
boundary. See "Supplementary data for pollution, water, biodiversity 
and waste, including estimates for non-operated assets" on pages 
434-437 for data reported against a financial control boundary.

Percentage of non-recycled waste [I]  73 %
[A] Waste data are calculated using methods required or recommended by relevant regulatory 
agencies or authorities. In the absence of these, mass is determined by direct measurement 
using weighbridges. In the absence of weighing facilities, mass is estimated. Due to the 
complex and site-specific nature of these calculations, it is not possible to state a degree of 
measurement uncertainty with confidence. These data include liquid waste streams that are 
classified as waste by regulators and sent for disposal to a third-party facility or re-injected 
on-site. They exclude process waste water, produced water and waste-water streams not 
classified as waste by regulators, including waste water discharged to a municipal or public 
treatment works. They also exclude contaminated soil remediated on-site or in situ. Split by 
category may not add up to the total due to rounding. 
[B] Waste generated is the total mass of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated and 
disposed of or diverted from disposal.
[C] Hazardous waste includes all waste that is defined as hazardous, toxic, dangerous, listed, 
priority, special or some other similar term as defined by an appropriate country, 
regulatory agency or authority.
[D] Radioactive waste is classified according to local regulations.
[E] Non-hazardous waste is all waste not classified as hazardous waste.
[F] Waste diverted from disposal may be reused, recycled or otherwise recovered, for 
example recovery of catalysts or precious metals. 
[G] Other recovery operations include incineration with energy recovery.
[H] Waste directed to disposal may be incinerated, sent to landfill or disposed of in some 
other way, such as chemical, physical or biological (or a combination) treatment that acts 
as the final disposal point.
[I] Non-recycled waste is the total mass of hazardous and non-hazardous waste that is 
directed to disposal.
In 2024, we disposed of 1,933 thousand tonnes of waste, compared 
with 2,251 thousand tonnes in 2023. 
We disposed of 1,396 thousand tonnes of non-hazardous waste in 
2024, compared with 1,619 thousand tonnes in 2023. The decrease 
was primarily due to the return-to-service of water treatment equipment 
after maintenance at the Scotford Upgrader in Canada. 
We disposed of 536 thousand tonnes of hazardous waste in 2024, 
compared with 631 thousand tonnes in 2023. The decrease was due to 
improved classification of generated waste in our Mobility and Low 
Carbon Fuels businesses and a reduction of drilling waste in Argentina.
We diverted 728 thousand tonnes of residual materials for reuse, 
recycling or use as a raw material in another process. This includes 
waste that might otherwise go to landfill being incinerated to generate 
energy.

Social | Own workforce (S1)
Our people are essential to our purpose of powering progress 
together. They are key to delivering our strategy and we believe in 
helping them to develop their skills.
Our double materiality assessment has identified working conditions 
and equal treatment and opportunities as material topics. See 
"Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with 
strategy and business model (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description 
of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
The successful delivery of our strategy depends on our people and on a 
culture that aligns with our goals and reflects the changes we need to 
make as part of the energy transition. Attracting, retaining, developing 
and motivating our people is core to our success.
This section explains Shell's approach to its own workforce. See 
"Workers in the value chain (S2)" on page 415 for information about 
our approach to non-employees in our value chain.
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and 
their interaction with strategy and business model 
(ESRS 2 SBM-3)
Except where otherwise stated, this ESRS S1 section covers Shell's 
own workforce, which comprises employees and, where relevant,
non-employees whom we engage on a temporary basis to augment 
our existing staff as the need arises. 
Shell's total workforce comprises employees and external workers, 
whom we refer to as our contingent workforce or contingent workers. 
Shell considers employees to be persons with whom we have an 
employment relationship, subject to the laws of the countries in which 
we do business. This includes people employed in Shell subsidiaries 
and Shell-operated joint ventures, and those seconded to non-operated 
joint operations, joint ventures or associates. 
Our contingent workforce is categorised in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations, based on job duties and responsibilities. We 
recognise different categories of contingent workers, including: 
(1) people who work under our day-to-day supervision on a temporary 
basis to augment existing staff;
(2) people who provide professional services based on a defined scope 
of work; and 
(3) people who work for suppliers providing outsourced services on a 
long-term basis.
The people under (1) are referred to as non-employees for the purpose 
of our disclosure and the people under (2) and (3) are together 
referred to as workers in the value chain, value chain workers or 
workers and fall under the scope of ESRS S2 for the purpose of our 
disclosure. People employed or otherwise engaged by non-operated 
ventures and by business partners are not part of our total workforce. 
Human capital is fundamental to Shell's business model and the 
delivery of our strategy. As the energy system transforms and we 
reshape our portfolio, elements of our culture will need to adapt. For 
example, we will have to develop new skills, and adapt our processes 
and systems, which, in some areas, will need to be different from those 
required for our traditional oil and gas businesses.
Our business activities have a positive economic impact on employees 
by creating jobs and providing competitive pay and benefits. Our 
employees and, where relevant, non-employees, also benefit from 
personal development opportunities through on-the-job learning, 
coaching and formal training.
Our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion has the potential for 
positive impacts by promoting equal opportunity based on objective 
factors and creating an environment where people feel included.
We take active steps to avoid potential negative impacts, including 
discrimination, harassment, non-respect of fundamental human or 
labour rights, and occupational health and safety incidents. As 
potential human rights and labour rights impacts can occur in any 
country, our systems are designed to assess potential exposure to 
forced labour and child labour based on the nature of the business 
activity and the location in which it is performed. We operate in some 
locations where potential negative impacts may arise from exposure 
to systemic human and labour rights risks or from individual incidents. 
The changing nature of our business has the potential to result in 
organisational changes which may affect the number of employees 
and expertise we require.
We pay particular attention to the needs of groups who may have 
heightened exposure to potential negative impacts associated with 
discrimination and harassment, such as women and ethnic minorities. 
We also give particular attention to workers whose roles involve 
exposure to operational safety hazards.
Portfolio companies
Portfolio companies are non-integrated entities within the Shell Group. 
To give these companies the flexibility they need, they operate as 
subsidiaries while generally retaining their own processes and systems. 
Portfolio companies comply with Shell's minimum requirements for 
controls and compliance. These include the Shell Performance 
Framework and mandatory requirements for ethics and compliance, risk 
management and safety. Portfolio companies generally maintain their 
own human resources policies, processes and systems. We expect them 
to comply with Shell's minimum standards on maternity leave, parental 
leave and life/accident/disability cover, subject to factors such as local 
laws and regulation. Our disclosures in ESRS S1 exclude portfolio 
companies except as stated above.
Policies related to own workforce (S1-1)
Shell's approach to managing impacts, risks and opportunities 
associated with our own workforce is guided by a combination of 
global and local policies. 
Shell employs people in more than 70 countries and is subject to 
different labour laws and practices in the jurisdictions where we do 
business. Our global policies are designed to establish minimum 
standards across countries. Our local policies respect applicable law, 
regulations and practices at a local level.
The policies described in this section apply to employees and, where 
required by law, to non-employees working in Shell subsidiaries and 
Shell-operated joint ventures and to those employees seconded to non-
operated joint operations (except in certain cases where we are 
precluded from offering Shell's minimum standards owing to the non-
operated venture structure), joint ventures or associates, or where 
otherwise stated.
We communicate our policies to our own workforce through a variety 
of channels, including new employee induction, Code of Conduct 
refresher training, internal communications and other Human 
Resources processes.

Human rights
Our commitment to respect the human rights of our total workforce 
is described in the Shell General Business Principles, which set the 
standard for how we conduct business aligned with our core values 
of honesty, integrity and respect for people. All people who form 
part of our total workforce are expected to behave in line with 
these principles. 
The Shell Code of Conduct explains how employees, contingent 
workers and anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live 
up to our business principles. It sets out our expectations with regard 
to a safe and healthy workplace, equal opportunity, freedom from 
discrimination and harassment, respect for fundamental human 
and labour rights, anti-bribery and fair competition.
Shell is committed to respecting human rights as set out in the United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work. This includes respect for freedom of association and the 
effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, elimination of 
forced and child labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of 
employment and occupation, and a safe and healthy working 
environment. We support relevant voluntary codes, including the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Global Compact. 
Shell has an integrated approach to human rights which is informed 
by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is 
embedded in our policies and management systems. We set similar 
expectations for our contingent workforce and suppliers through the 
Shell Supplier Principles (see page 425). Our policies and systems 
specifically address child labour and forced labour. In general, this 
would include human trafficking.
See "Processes for engaging with own workforce and workers' 
representatives about impacts (S1-2)" on page 410 for information 
about our approach to workforce engagement. See "Processes to 
remediate negative impacts and channels for own workforce to raise 
concerns (S1-3)" on page 411 for information about access to remedy.
Discrimination and equal opportunity
Shell's Code of Conduct sets out our expectations for equal opportunity 
in employment decisions based on objective factors. It recognises the 
value of diversity and prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, 
religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, 
disability, ethnic origin or nationality. It does not explicitly refer to 
political opinion, national extraction or social origin. However, it 
requires employment decisions to be based solely on objective factors 
such as merit, qualifications, performance and business considerations.
The Code of Conduct prohibits harassment, defined as any action, 
conduct or behaviour which is humiliating, intimidating or hostile. 
We expect employees, contingent workers and anyone else acting 
on behalf of Shell to treat others with respect and to avoid situations 
that may be perceived as inappropriate.
Due to differences in employment laws in the countries in which we 
operate, our global policies do not include specific commitments 
related to positive action for groups within our workforce, other than 
those indicated above. Local policies may vary depending on local 
laws, regulations or practices for specific groups within our workforce. 
See "Diversity, equity and inclusion" on page 117 for more information.
Our policies and management practices are designed to eliminate 
discrimination and seek to address bias in attraction, selection, 
development, performance and reward management. Examples of 
procedures for implementing these policies include our job resourcing 
guidelines and accessibility standards applied through the hiring process, 
a global performance management approach that determines pay 
outcomes, gender and salary grade checks for skewness in individual 
performance outcomes, a global job evaluation and benchmarking 
system, and regular country pay equity checks. When evidence of bias is 
detected, follow-up actions may include further work to understand the 
reasons and taking corrective steps where appropriate.
Life/accident/disability cover
Shell has a global standard of a minimum of twice the annual base 
salary for death in service or an injury benefit associated with a 
workplace accident. This is a total figure that includes both state-
provided benefits and employer-provided contributions.
Maternity leave
Shell has a global minimum standard of 16 weeks paid maternity leave, 
enabling new mothers to put their families first and spend more time 
with their newborns.
Parental leave
Shell has a global minimum standard of eight weeks' paid leave to 
all non-birthing parents, subject to any local restrictions. This policy 
includes new fathers and parents welcoming a child through surrogacy 
or adoption. Paid parental leave for non-birthing parents applies 
regardless of gender, gender identity or marital status.
Pay philosophy and Fair Pay Principles 
Our Fair Pay Principles are designed to manage pay at Shell and help 
us ensure that employees are valued, respected and recognised for the 
work they do. Shell's pay is designed to be market competitive and free 
from bias. Shell sets clear performance expectations, gives employees 
the opportunity to share in Shell's success through a variety of variable 
pay schemes, and is transparent and clear in its communication of pay.
We ensure fairness by applying our Fair Pay Principles across pay-
related matters and limit the opportunity for bias through several 
internal processes and practices. We do not pay differently owing to 
gender, ethnicity or other characteristics. Portfolio companies generally 
maintain their own pay philosophies and principles.
Health and safety
The Shell Code of Conduct requires every Shell company, supplier 
and joint venture under Shell operational control to have a systematic 
approach to managing health, safety, security, environment and social 
performance (HSSE & SP). We expect non-operated joint ventures to 
adopt appropriate and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
This requirement is designed to ensure compliance with the law and 
to achieve continuous performance improvement while promoting a 
culture in which our total workforce shares this commitment. See 
"Policies related to safety" on page 429 for details of our safety 
policies and standards.
Processes for engaging with own workforce and 
workers' representatives about impacts (S1-2)
Insight into employee needs and perspectives enables Shell to 
continually learn and improve our policies, processes and practices. 
The Shell People Survey is one of the key tools we use to measure 
employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to 
Shell. External and internal research shows that increased employee 
engagement can result in better business performance and improved 
safety. In 2024, the response rate to the survey was 86%, compared 
with 88% in 2023 which indicates our people's desire to provide 
feedback. The overall employee engagement score decreased to 75 
(compared with the top quartile 80 points) from 79 points in 2023, 
which we believe reflects the level of changes introduced in the 
organisation as we transform our business to deliver more value 
with less emissions.

---- Page 413 ----
Across Shell, employees have access to senior leaders, local employee 
forums and employee resource groups. These engagements enable 
Shell to maintain a constructive employee and industrial relations 
environment. 
Management regularly engages with employees and, where relevant, 
non-employees, through elected employee representatives and a range 
of local formal and informal channels. These channels include webcasts 
and all-employee messages from our CEO and other senior leaders, 
as well as town halls, team meetings and site visits by the Board and 
Executive Committee. Engagement takes place continually throughout 
the year.
We respect the right to collective bargaining and freedom of 
association. Shell respects local law in our efforts to advance labour 
principles.
Where appropriate, engagement takes place with union and employee 
representatives at asset and country level, as well as with the Shell 
European Works Council.
We gain insight into the needs of specific groups of employees and, 
where relevant, non-employees, through a network of around 120 
employee resource groups in 30 countries and regions. These groups 
cover areas such as gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+, disability 
inclusion, parents, new graduates, experienced hires and veterans. 
Engagement with employee resource groups takes place on a regular 
basis, including at senior leadership levels. We may also obtain insights 
from third parties and external partnerships.
Shell's Human Resources (HR) function, headed by the Chief Human 
Resources and Corporate Officer, has operational responsibility for 
employee engagement.
Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels 
for own workforce to raise concerns (S1-3)
Where we have potentially caused or contributed to adverse impacts, 
we seek to provide and facilitate access to remedy.
Providing access to remedy
Shell provides multiple channels for employees and, where relevant, 
non-employees, to raise concerns and seek access to remedy. We use 
information generated by these processes to monitor trends, assess 
effectiveness and improve performance.
Where appropriate, we encourage employees and non-employees to 
raise concerns directly with their line manager or an HR representative. 
In some countries, additional resources may be available to facilitate 
conversations, such as an employee representative body. 
Employees and non-employees can raise concerns confidentially via the 
Shell Global Helpline, a formal channel for receiving and following up 
enquiries and complaints. Employees and non-employees can submit 
reports to the Shell Global Helpline on a named or anonymous basis. 
If the report is a query, or a dilemma for which advice is sought, it will 
be passed to someone qualified to provide that advice, such as an 
appointed expert in the subject or a member of our legal team. If the 
report is of the nature of an allegation that requires investigation, an 
investigator or investigation team will be assigned. This will usually 
involve one or more trained investigators with subject matter 
experience and any needed local knowledge.
In locations where effective third-party complaint systems are 
established by local law, policy or practice, we may also participate 
in these as a channel to receive and respond to concerns.
In 2024, all our employees and non-employees had access to channels 
to raise their employment concerns or grievances, including the Shell 
Global Helpline. We communicate the existence of these channels to 
our own workforce on a regular basis through new employee induction, 
Code of Conduct refresher training and leadership messages.
Assessing effectiveness
We use several mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of our 
engagement and access to remedy.
Shell's Business Integrity Department collects and analyses data on 
allegations involving potential violations of the Shell Code of Conduct 
and the outcome of the investigation, whether received via the Shell 
Global Helpline or a local Human Resources process. This information 
enables us to monitor trends in complaints received and how they 
are addressed.
The annual Shell People Survey includes questions designed to test 
whether employees feel safe to speak up, whether teams are free from 
harassment and bullying, whether there are equal opportunities for 
people to develop and progress and whether employees trust that 
discrimination, harassment and bullying will be investigated and 
appropriately actioned.
We maintain a stringent no retaliation policy to protect any person 
making an allegation in good faith. This protection extends to those 
who participate in or conduct an investigation as well as workers' 
representatives.
Taking action on material impacts on own workforce, 
and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing 
material opportunities related to own workforce, and 
effectiveness of those actions (S1-4)
The scope of the actions described in this section cover Shell employees 
and non-employees, where applicable. Many of our actions are of an 
ongoing nature. Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are 
indicated where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
In 2024, we continued our employee dialogue to mitigate the impact 
on our own workforce arising from portfolio and structural changes in 
the organisation.
The Shell Performance Framework supports the delivery of sustainable 
business outcomes. In 2024, we continued to embed the Shell 
Performance Framework in our human resources processes, with the 
aim of ensuring all elements of our culture are harnessed to deliver on 
our strategy. 
We continued to raise awareness and promote skill building on mental 
well-being at Shell through Shell's Global Mental Well-being 
Programme. We continued to increase resources available to our 
employees and, where relevant, to non-employees, on other pertinent 
topics such as financial well-being. 
We supported several countries to develop country-level diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DE&I) plans. We make our progress transparent 
through an internal DE&I dashboard that is accessible on a voluntary 
basis to all Shell employees.
We track the effectiveness of our actions through several mechanisms, 
including internal reporting and analysis of performance data, and 
feedback received though the Shell Global Helpline, Shell People 
Survey and other engagement channels.

---- Page 414 ----
We take action to support access to remedy through a variety of 
channels, including the Shell Global Helpline. We also seek to 
understand the needs of our workforce through mechanisms such as the 
Shell People Survey and our Global Mental Well-being programme.
We identify actual or potential impacts on our workforce through a 
variety of means. These include feedback from human resources and 
line managers, feedback from engagement and the Shell People 
Survey, learning from Shell Global Helpline cases and other 
mechanisms. Impacts that are relevant at a global level are discussed 
at an appropriate management level. Where necessary, this may result 
in actions being taken.
Shell seeks to avoid or minimise material adverse impacts on our own 
workforce by embedding respect for the rights of our employees and, 
where relevant, non-employees, in our policies and practices. Shell is 
committed to respecting human rights as set out in the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour 
Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. We provide and facilitate access to 
remedy. See "Policies related to own workforce (S1-1)" on page 409 
for more information.
Resourcing our actions
The Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer is the most senior 
executive in Shell with accountability for the overall development, 
governance and oversight of Shell's Human Resources policies. Human 
Resources leaders in legal entities are accountable for implementation 
of applicable policies and for compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. Human resources policies are implemented by members of 
Shell's Human Resources function. The requirements of our policies are 
communicated to people involved with implementation through various 
mechanisms, including internal communication channels, management 
systems and training as appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮engage in constructive dialogue with employees and, where 
relevant, with non employees;
￮ measure engagement through the Shell People Survey;
￮ implement our global policies;
￮ work towards our diversity, equity and inclusion ambitions; and
￮ support access to remedy through the Shell Global Helpline and 
other channels.
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list. See "Our 
People" on pages 115-119 for more information.
Targets related to managing material negative impacts, 
advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks 
and opportunities (S1-5)
Shell has set voluntary ambitions to advance our aim to become one of 
the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. We engage 
with our own workforce and employee resource groups on Shell's 
approach to diversity, equity and inclusion. These voluntary ambitions 
as specified below meet the ESRS definition of a target.
We inform employees and employee representative bodies about our 
progress towards our ambitions and how we can improve our 
performance. We communicate our progress transparently in internal 
and external reporting where relevant.
Women in senior leadership
To meet our aim of improving gender balance, we have an ambition to 
achieve 35% representation of women in our senior leadership 
positions by 2025 and 40% by 2030, compared with 29.5% in the 
baseline year of 2021 (excluding portfolio companies). At the end of 
2024, representation of women was 33% compared with 32% at the 
end of 2023. This level of progress is consistent with our expectations 
when setting the ambition.
The scope of this ambition refers to an existing Shell measure for senior 
leadership based on compensation grades. The total number of these 
positions may change from year to year. We focus on representation 
as a percentage of this total group.
Ethnic minorities in Senior Management
In support of the UK's Parker Review recommendations, we have 
an ambition to achieve 15% ethnic minority representation in Senior 
Management by 2027, compared with 14% in the baseline year 
of 2023 (excluding portfolio companies). At the end of 2024, our 
representation was 15%. This level of progress is consistent with our 
expectations when setting the ambition.
As per Parker Review recommendations, Senior Management refers to 
senior leadership based in the UK and is a Shell measure based on 
compensation grades. We have moved to this Shell definition of Senior 
Management for 2024 onwards to align with our self-identification 
data collection and processes. Ethnic minority refers to an individual 
who self-identifies as Asian, Black, Mixed/multiple, or other ethnic 
minority group, in line with UK Office for National Statistics 
classifications.

the end of the reporting period. 
See "Changes in headcount" on page 115 for more information.
Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue (S1-8)
We respect the right to collective bargaining and freedom of 
association. Where appropriate, engagements take place with union 
representatives at asset and country level, as well as with the Shell 
European Works Council. Employees covered by collective bargaining 
agreements are those individuals to whom Shell is obliged to apply the 
agreement. Agreements may apply to unionised and non-unionised 
employees. An employee covered by more than one collective 
bargaining agreement is only counted once.

[B] Senior Leadership is a Shell measure based on compensation grade levels.
See the table "Employees by age group" on page 116 for information 
on the distribution of employees by age group.
Adequate wages (S1-10)
Shell's pay is designed to be market competitive. We expect that our 
employees can meet their basic needs through the pay and benefits 
that we provide. Shell pays its employees an adequate wage, in line 
with applicable benchmarks, which we regularly check.
See "Pay philosophy and Fair Pay Principles" on page 410 for more 
information.
This assessment does not take into account any additional non-salary 
components of total remuneration that may be applicable, such as 
benefits and share awards. 
Health and safety metrics (S1-14)
The Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, Security, Safety, the 
Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) requires Shell 
companies, contractors and joint ventures under our operational 
control to adopt a systematic approach to managing HSSE risk to 
achieve compliance with the law and continuous improvement in 
performance. We expect ventures not under our operational control to 
adopt an equivalent approach. 
All employees and non-employees working under our day-to-day 
supervision are covered by the appropriate HSSE & SP requirements 
which may be implemented through our own management system 
based on our standards or the supplier's management system, 
depending on the contract mode.
See "Contractor HSSE management" on page 429 for information on 
our approach to managing HSSE in contracts and "Personal safety" on 
page 432 for information on our safety performance.
Remuneration metrics (pay gap and total remuneration) 
(S1-16)
We operate objective pay processes and seek to address bias. The 
basis for paying fairly is equal pay for equal work, taking into account 
factors such as performance and experience. We monitor pay equity 
through regular analysis to obtain confidence that we have pay equity 
between genders for performing the same jobs. We address any 
unexplained pay differences related to gender through rigorous 
internal processes.
See "Discrimination and equal opportunity" on page 410 for more 
information.

We continue to make progress towards gender balance across Shell, 
but a gender pay gap exists for several reasons, including fewer 
women in senior leadership positions and fewer women in higher-paid 
specialist roles. See "Diversity, equity and inclusion" on page 117.
The reporting basis for calculating the annual total remuneration ratio 
of the highest paid individual to the median annual total remuneration 
for all employees follows the European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards. This methodology differs from calculations performed to 
comply with UK reporting regulations. See "CEO pay ratio" on page 
204.
Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts 
(S1-17)
In 2024, a total of 2,025 reports were submitted to the Shell Global 
Helpline, the main channel for employees and non-employees to raise 
concerns outside of their management line. These reports include both 
enquiries and allegations. Of these, 691 reports involved concerns 
about discrimination or harassment. Another 75 reports involved 
concerns related to health and safety, working conditions or other 
work-related rights. 
A total of 82 cases of discrimination or harassment were found to be 
substantiated, along with 23 cases related to health and safety, 
working conditions or other work-related rights. Cases found to be 
substantiated include reports received in the current period as well as 
reports received in a prior period and closed in the current one. These 
figures do not include cases that remain open at the end of the 
reporting period. Because we allow concerns to be submitted 
anonymously, our data do not distinguish between concerns filed by 
employees and non-employees. 
In 2024, no complaints concerning our own workforce were filed with 
a National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises.
An incident is a legal action or complaint registered with the undertaking 
or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-
compliance identified by the undertaking through established 
procedures. According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, a severe human rights incident is characterised by the 
significant impact it may have, which is evaluated based on its scale, 
scope and irremediable nature. An incident may be severe by virtue of 
one or more of these criteria. 
In 2024, no severe human rights incidents involving our own workforce 
were identified.
Workers in the value chain (S2)
Care for people reflects our core values and our approach to safety 
and human rights. We also know that when people feel cared for, 
they perform at their best. We seek to respect and promote the 
rights and welfare of our employees, contingent workforce and 
others in our value chain.
Our double materiality assessment has identified workers in the value 
chain and responsible sourcing as material topics. See "Material 
impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and 
business model (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of the process 
to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" 
on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
Our business depends on a competitive and resilient supply chain. 
Suppliers play an important role in helping us deliver our strategy and 
creating value for us and our stakeholders.
Our supply chain is diverse, encompassing small, medium and large 
enterprises across many countries and categories of goods and 
services. Across Shell's supply chains, we seek to source goods and 
services responsibly. These supplier relationships have positive impacts 
as well as the potential for negative impacts.
This section discusses our approach to workers in the value chain. See 
"Management of relationships with suppliers (G1-2)" on page 425 for 
information about our general approach to responsible sourcing.
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 
SBM-3)
Shell's total workforce comprises employees and external workers, to 
whom we refer as our contingent workforce or contingent workers. 
Our contingent workforce is categorised in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations, based on job duties and responsibilities. We 
recognise different categories of contingent workers, including: 
(1) people who work under our day-to-day supervision on a temporary 
basis to augment existing staff;
(2) people who provide professional services based on a defined scope 
of work; and 
(3) people who work for suppliers providing outsourced services on a 
long-term basis.
The people under (1) are referred to as non-employees for the purpose 
of our disclosure and fall under the scope of ESRS S1. People employed 
or otherwise engaged by non-operated ventures and by business 
partners are not part of our total workforce.
Our standards address two main types of value chain worker. Our 
worker welfare standards focus on people under (2) and (3) who work 
on Shell sites or as dedicated supplier staff on non-Shell sites. In 
addition to the categories listed above, our enhanced value chain due 
diligence policy applies to people who work in our supply chains for 
non-hydrocarbon goods and services and who are not generally 
considered part of our contingent workforce. For the purpose of our 
disclosure under ESRS S2, we refer to people covered by these policies 
as workers, workers in the value chain, value chain workers or supplier 
staff, subject to the scope limitations set out above.
Throughout this section, we discuss worker welfare and enhanced value 
chain due diligence separately to highlight differences in approach to 
workers covered by these standards.

---- Page 417 ----
Our disclosures in this section cover different types of workers who may 
be impacted directly or indirectly by Shell's operations or business 
relationships. Across these types, the nature of our contractual 
relationships and our ability to influence varies.
Our disclosure covers our upstream value chain for non-hydrocarbon 
goods and services. It does not cover workers in our downstream value 
chain, such as persons working for independent licencees or dealers in 
our retail network who sell Shell-branded products. We aim to carry 
out further work in the future to deepen our understanding of this 
population.
For workers on Shell sites and dedicated supplier staff on non-Shell 
sites, we aim to prevent and mitigate potential negative impacts on 
physical and/or mental well-being arising from inadequate living and/
or working conditions as relevant. This includes requiring suppliers to 
manage potential impacts associated with accommodation, safety, 
workload, wages and job security. We also seek to prevent and 
mitigate potential labour rights impacts in areas such as forced labour, 
child labour, freedom of association and collective bargaining, 
recruitment practices and access to remedy. These impacts are 
generally managed through our suppliers.
As potential human rights impacts can arise in any country or category, 
we take a risk-based approach to assessing suppliers. We derive 
supply-chain country information from a third-party vendor, who assess 
certain activities and countries to be more exposed to potential 
negative impacts. Examples of areas assessed as having high exposure 
to labour rights risks include parts of Asia, Africa and the Middle East 
and South and Central America. 
Depending on the nature of the contract and the location in which the 
work is performed, we may pay particular attention to sub-groups of 
value chain workers who are identified as especially vulnerable, such 
as migrant workers. We use a third-party vendor for analysis of 
countries with high potential for negative impacts on labour rights and 
for internal assessments of high-potential-impact activities.
The changing nature of our business has the potential to affect the 
types of goods and services we procure, which may have indirect 
impacts on workers employed by our suppliers.
When considering workers covered by our enhanced value chain due 
diligence policy, certain categories of goods and services, including 
raw materials and feedstocks, may also be assessed as having high 
potential exposure to human rights impacts. In these situations, we 
proceed on the basis that potential negative impacts could be more 
likely to arise, triggering the need for additional due diligence to 
manage the potential impacts on workers effectively.
Our operations also have positive impacts on value chain workers 
through economic opportunity, skill development, and improved 
working conditions and safety standards.
Showing care for people is part of our core values and is reflected in 
the Shell General Business Principles and Shell Performance 
Framework. Care for workers in our value chain also benefits Shell by 
improving safety, productivity and quality in our operations.
Policies related to value chain workers (S2-1)
Shell has adopted policies and standards to identify and manage 
impacts on value chain workers in specified parts of our upstream value 
chain. We also set expectations for how our suppliers, and non-
operated joint ventures, manage potential impacts. Our approach 
reflects the varying degrees of influence we have at different levels of 
the value chain based on our contractual rights and obligations.
The policies and standards described in this section apply to Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator. We expect 
non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate and acceptable 
policies to manage their risks.
Human rights and value chain workers
We are committed to respecting the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights; and the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles of Rights at 
Work of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which covers: 
freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to 
collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, 
the abolition of child labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect 
of employment and occupation, and a safe and healthy working 
environment. We also support voluntary frameworks such as the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Global 
Compact, and the Building Responsibly Principles. Our approach to 
workers in the value chain is informed by the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. As outlined in the Shell 
Supplier Principles, our suppliers should provide workers with a 
dedicated whistle-blowing mechanism where grievances related to the 
above topics can be logged confidentially. In 2024, no cases of non-
respect of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or 
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were identified in 
our upstream and downstream value chain.
Shell Supplier Principles
Shell seeks to work with suppliers that behave in an economically, 
environmentally and socially responsible manner. 
The Shell Supplier Principles set out our expectations of suppliers with 
respect to business integrity; health, safety, security, environment and 
social performance (HSSE & SP); and labour and human rights. We 
carry out risk-based pre-contractual screening to assess the ability of 
suppliers to meet our requirements. In our procurement contracts, 
suppliers agree to adhere to the Shell General Business Principles, the 
Shell Supplier Principles and the Shell Code of Conduct. Suppliers are 
required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and agree 
to provide and maintain safe and healthy working conditions for all 
their workers. We specify in our contracts that we expect suppliers to 
impose the same or equivalent requirements on their direct suppliers. 
The Shell Supplier Principles set out our expectations that suppliers 
should conduct their activities in a manner that respects human rights as 
set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
and the core conventions of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO). In particular, suppliers are expected to ensure no use of child or 
forced labour; no payment of recruitment fees by workers; compliance 
with applicable laws on freedom of association and collective 
bargaining; a safe and healthy workplace free of discrimination, 
harassment or retaliation; compliance with applicable laws on working 
hours; and wages and benefits that meet or exceed national legal 
standards. We also expect suppliers to provide value chain workers 
with a dedicated grievance mechanism where concerns can be logged 
confidentially. 
The Shell Supplier Principles apply to contracts managed by Shell's 
Supply Chain organisation, which generally manages procurement of 
non-hydrocarbon goods and services on behalf of Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator. See "Shell Supplier 
Principles" on page 425.

Worker welfare
Shell has established standards to ensure compliance with fundamental 
labour rights for value chain workers on Shell sites and dedicated 
supplier staff on non-Shell sites. These are embedded in our Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards and our 
Category Management and Contracting Process Framework. 
We refer to them collectively as "worker welfare". See "SEAM 
Standards" on page 130.
Our approach is based on the 10 principles established by Building 
Responsibly, an alliance of companies that seeks to promote the rights 
and welfare of workers in the engineering and construction industry.
Before awarding a contract, our standards require an assessment of 
whether the contract has high potential exposure to worker welfare 
impacts. If so, our standards require us to pre-qualify the supplier's 
capability to manage these issues. For contracts with high potential 
exposure to worker welfare risks, our standards require the supplier to 
develop a worker welfare management plan.
The plan is designed to achieve compliance with the Building 
Responsibly Principles and International Finance Corporation and 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development standards on 
worker accommodation. It establishes minimum expectations for labour 
rights, including: no discrimination; no forced, trafficked or child labour; 
ethical recruitment; freedom to change employment; access to 
documentation; respect for wage and benefit agreements; worker 
representation; access to grievance mechanisms; and healthy, safe and 
habitable living and working conditions. The plan includes regular 
performance measurement and reviews. Our standards require 
suppliers to consider worker feedback when developing or updating 
the plan.
Building Responsibly Worker Welfare Principles
Our standards require us to assure the effectiveness of worker 
welfare management plans, review performance against contractual 
requirements and agree actions for continuous improvement.
We use a risk-based approach to verify implementation of action plans 
through mechanisms such as audits, site visits and updates as part of 
general business performance reviews with suppliers.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
In 2024, we took steps to strengthen our human rights due diligence 
processes for sourcing goods and services. Identifying and mitigating 
potential negative impacts in this part of our value chain can be 
challenging, as the nature of our contractual relationships means we 
may have less visibility into potential issues and less scope to exert 
influence. We have introduced a new policy within our Category 
Management and Contracting Process Framework requiring additional 
due diligence for new contracts with the highest potential for human 
rights impacts. The scope of this policy is limited to procurement 
contracts managed by Shell's Supply Chain organisation, which 
generally manages procurement of non-hydrocarbon goods and 
services on behalf of Shell companies and joint ventures in which 
Shell is the operator.
For new contracts, we apply a risk-based approach to screening for 
potential human rights impacts during pre-qualification or tendering. 
We conduct due diligence to verify suppliers' ability to meet our 
standards for categories of goods and services with the highest 
potential exposure to negative impacts. These categories include 
specified raw materials, feedstocks, components and transport and 
logistics services.
For high risk contracts, the policy requires suppliers to complete a 
capability assessment of their ability to prevent, mitigate and remediate 
negative impacts within their own operations and relevant parts of their 
supply chain. If gaps are identified, suppliers are required to develop 
an action plan with controls in place prior to contract commencement. 
For contracts assessed as high risk for potential negative impacts, the 
policy also requires the inclusion of human rights due diligence clauses 
and progress checks during contract performance reviews.
Processes for engaging with value chain workers about 
impacts (S2-2)
Suppliers are responsible for undertaking engagement with their own 
workforce. Our approach to supporting them in this responsibility is set 
out below.
We discuss worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence 
separately to highlight differences in approach to workers covered by 
these standards.
Worker welfare
Suppliers working on Shell sites or providing dedicated staff on non-
Shell sites are responsible for undertaking engagement with their 
own workforce. Shell may support such engagement as part of our 
approach to avoiding and managing potential negative impacts. 
We encourage our suppliers to undertake regular and constructive 
dialogue with their employees. For contracts assessed as having high 
potential exposure to worker welfare impacts, we ask suppliers to 
gather worker feedback when developing and implementing worker 
welfare management plans. We encourage our suppliers to engage 
directly with value chain workers or their legitimate representatives 
where possible. Shell is not a party to direct engagement between 
value chain workers and their employers nor are we involved in 
collective bargaining agreements between value chain workers 
and their employers.
Sustainability Statements | Social | Workers in the value chain (S2) continued
416 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 419 ----
Engagement with value chain workers on Shell sites takes place on 
a regular basis though channels such as leadership engagements, 
onboarding, training, worker surveys and pre-work meetings. We 
encourage suppliers to engage in regular dialogue with their 
employees about worker welfare.
Suppliers are responsible for direct engagement with their employees 
and for complying with contractual requirements related to worker 
welfare. The most senior role in the relevant Shell entity with 
operational responsibility for monitoring compliance with contractual 
requirements is the local Shell contract holder. Overall accountability 
for contract management on site rests with the project or asset 
manager.
We offer training to suppliers to help them meet our expectations, 
including with respect to implementing the Building Responsibly 
Principles. Suppliers are also informed about channels for raising 
concerns on an anonymous basis through the Shell Global Helpline 
or local grievance mechanisms. Supplier staff working on Shell sites 
undergo training in Shell's safety and worker welfare standards 
before starting work. 
Our approach to safety and worker welfare places a consistent focus 
on human performance. This starts with the recognition that people 
make mistakes and that our preventive barriers need to be capable 
of managing the impact of those mistakes without undesirable 
consequences for people or the environment. We seek to promote a 
culture where everyone feels empowered to intervene and to speak up 
freely without repercussions so that we and/or the employing supplier 
can address impacts and learn from any feedback received.
We assess the effectiveness of our engagement through various means. 
This includes feedback received from value chain workers or their 
representatives during leadership or supervisor engagements, concerns 
raised via Shell or supplier grievance mechanisms, and indirect 
indicators of engagement such as safety performance. Depending 
on the contract, we may agree key performance indicators with the 
supplier that are tailored for the local context.
We consult with international organisations and industry associations 
to understand and respond to current and emerging human rights 
issues relevant to our business. These include Ipieca, the global oil and 
gas industry association for advancing environmental and social 
performance across the energy transition; Building Responsibly; and the 
human rights working group of Business for Social Responsibility. When 
we identify groups who are particularly vulnerable to negative impacts, 
such as migrant workers, we may take additional steps to understand 
their needs and concerns, through consultation with suppliers or 
knowledgeable third parties.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
Our ability to engage with workers covered by our enhanced value 
chain due diligence policy is constrained by the nature of our 
contractual relationship with the supplier and the fact that we may not 
have direct or indirect access to such workers. In these situations, we 
are generally more reliant on publicly available information or third 
parties to help us understand potential negative impacts.
Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels 
for value chain workers to raise concerns (S2-3)
Shell aims to provide multiple channels for value chain workers to 
raise concerns and obtain access to remedy. If we become aware of 
concerns pertaining to one of our suppliers, we will raise this as part 
of supplier performance management. 
We discuss worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence 
separately to highlight differences in approach to workers covered by 
these standards.
Worker welfare
We expect suppliers working on Shell sites or providing dedicated staff 
on non-Shell sites to provide grievance mechanisms where workers can 
raise concerns on an anonymous basis. For contracts assessed as 
having high potential exposure to worker welfare impacts, we require 
suppliers to detail how they will provide a grievance mechanism. 
Shell employees, contingent workers and third parties can raise 
concerns anonymously through the Shell Global Helpline, which is 
available in multiple languages 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
At sites where value chain workers are drawn from the local 
community, workers may also use community feedback mechanisms 
that have been established to receive, track and respond to questions 
and complaints. It is possible to raise concerns via this mechanism 
anonymously. See "Providing access to remedy" on page 411 for 
more information.
Regardless of the channel, we seek to address concerns in a timely and 
equitable manner. Participation in a grievance mechanism provided by 
Shell or a supplier does not prevent a complainant from raising their 
concern with a third party if it is not possible to achieve a resolution 
through mutual agreement.
Our standards require our own grievance mechanisms and those 
of suppliers to include measures for tracking concerns and using 
the feedback to update the worker welfare management plan. 
We encourage suppliers to assess whether the mechanism is trusted 
and provides effective access to remedy.
We communicate the existence of grievance mechanisms to workers in 
the value chain. We maintain a stringent no-retaliation policy to protect 
any person making an allegation in good faith. This protection extends 
to those who participate in or conduct an investigation.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
The Shell Supplier Principles require suppliers to establish grievance 
mechanisms for their own employees and to impose a similar 
requirement on their direct suppliers. Concerns can also be raised 
anonymously through the Shell Global Helpline.
Taking action on material impacts on value chain 
workers, and approaches to managing material risks 
and pursuing material opportunities related to value 
chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions (S2-4)
In 2024, we continued to take steps to improve our approach to 
worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence. 
The scope of the actions described in this section cover Shell companies 
and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless otherwise 
stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. Horizons for 
the completion of time-bound actions are indicated where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
We discuss worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence 
separately to highlight differences in approach to workers covered by 
these standards.

Worker welfare
In 2024, we continued to collaborate with peers and suppliers to drive 
higher standards and consistency across the industry.
With Ipieca, we developed a toolkit of definitions and resources to 
support energy companies to enhance worker engagement and 
responsible recruitment. 
We continued to work with a group of businesses in the energy sector 
including bp, Equinor, Ørsted and TenneT to further develop the 
Worker Welfare Group, a partnership focused on labour rights and 
worker welfare within the marine construction sector. The group has 
developed a set of principles and guidelines to support, in the first 
instance, the Singapore marine construction sector to meet 
international standards for labour rights and worker welfare, focusing 
on responsible recruitment, improved accommodation, better transport, 
and improved access to grievance mechanisms. The group has also 
engaged with key stakeholders to advocate systemic improvements 
and, additionally, is working with local organisations to facilitate 
access to remedy for workers.
To improve how we manage worker welfare, we updated our 
expectations in the Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP to 
include implementation of the Building Responsibly Principles. For 
contracts assessed as having high potential for negative impacts on 
worker welfare, we introduced new requirements as part of our SEAM 
Standards on worker welfare to ensure value chain workers are 
informed of labour rights issues and how to get access to remedy 
before starting work.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
In 2024, we began embedding our policy on enhanced value chain 
due diligence processes for suppliers of highest risk goods and services. 
See "Policies related to value chain workers (S2-1)" on page 415 for 
information.
Also in 2024, we exchanged best practice on implementing human 
rights due diligence in supply chains with a cross-sectoral group of 
companies organised by Business for Social Responsibility. We actively 
collaborate with industry peers in Ipieca's supply chain working group.
Assessing effectiveness 
We discuss worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence 
separately to highlight differences in approach to workers covered by 
these standards.
Worker welfare
To assess the effectiveness of our actions on worker welfare, including 
effectiveness of grievance mechanisms, we may undertake checks 
ranging from self assessment and peer review to internal audits. We 
also perform periodic contract reviews which may include assessing the 
effectiveness of the grievance mechanism and contract-specific key 
performance indicators. We may gather worker feedback through 
surveys, site visits and other channels.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
Having adopted our enhanced value chain due diligence policy in 
2024, we aim to conduct internal assessments to verify compliance 
with the new policy as well as periodic contract reviews.
Responding to concerns
We discuss worker welfare and enhanced value chain due diligence 
separately to highlight differences in approach to workers covered by 
these standards.
Worker welfare
We may become aware of actual or potential negative impacts 
through channels such as local grievance mechanisms, the Shell Global 
Helpline or information provided by a supplier or third party. 
Depending on the nature of the issue, we may investigate the concern 
ourselves or refer it to the supplier for follow-up.
If an incident is confirmed, we review the circumstances and decide 
on the action to be taken. When the impacts are preventable or 
remediable, we may engage with the supplier to take appropriate 
measures.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
Our approach to enhanced value chain due diligence encourages 
collaboration with suppliers to address potential dilemmas and gaps in 
performance through ongoing performance management. We intend 
to periodically review and update our assessment of value chains with 
high potential exposure to negative impacts to help us to make sure our 
risk-based controls are as up to date as possible.
For more information on our approach to access to remedy, see 
"Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain 
workers to raise concerns (S2-3)" on page 417.
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to worker welfare is 
supported by members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management function as well as our Health, Supply Chain and Real 
Estate organisations. These include experts in worker welfare, safety 
and other disciplines.
The Executive Vice President for Supply Chain, Contracting and 
Procurement is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability for 
the overall development, governance and oversight of the Shell 
Supplier Principles and our policy on enhanced value chain due 
diligence. Contract holders are responsible for implementing these 
requirements.
Implementation is supported by members of Shell's Supply Chain, 
Contracting and Procurement function, which includes subject matter 
experts in procurement, contract management and other disciplines.
The requirements of our standards and policies are communicated to 
people involved with implementation through various mechanisms, 
including internal communication channels, management systems and 
training as appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮manage worker welfare in line with our standards;
￮ embed our policy on enhanced value chain due diligence; and
￮ support efforts to provide access to remedy for value chain workers.
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.

---- Page 421 ----
Other disclosures
Shell seeks to avoid or minimise material adverse impacts on value 
chain workers by embedding respect for their rights in our policies and 
practices. Shell is committed to respecting human rights as set out in the 
UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. 
Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. We provide and facilitate access to remedy. Our 
suppliers are expected to conduct their activities in a manner that 
respects human rights as set out in the UN Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the core conventions of the ILO.
See "Shell Supplier Principles" on page 425 and "Policies related to 
value chain workers (S2-1)" on page 415 for more information.
An incident is a legal action or complaint registered with the undertaking 
or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-
compliance identified by the undertaking through established 
procedures. According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, a severe human rights incident is characterised by the 
significant impact it may have, which is evaluated based on its scale, 
scope and irremediable nature. An incident may be severe by virtue of 
one or more of these criteria. 
In 2024, we investigated and substantiated three reports related to 
workers in the value chain, arising from both external reports and 
identification through our procedures. These cases concerned matters 
including late payment of wages, failure to provide unrestricted access 
to passports and the requirement to pay recruitment fees. 
We take these matters very seriously. We are following up with the 
suppliers and sub-suppliers concerned, and have required them to 
develop corrective action plans, including setting out how the suppliers 
provide remedy to the persons affected.
Targets related to managing material negative impacts, 
advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks 
and opportunities (S2-5)
Exposure to potential human rights impacts varies according to factors 
such as the nature of the work being performed, the capability of the 
supplier and the location in which the activity takes place. As a result, 
while we may establish key performance indicators at a contractual 
level, we have not set consolidated targets for workers in the value 
chain at a Group level. 
Our agreements with suppliers specify our performance expectations 
and period in which these apply. Suppliers are responsible for 
engagement with value chain workers, including with respect to topics 
such as goal setting, performance tracking or identifying opportunities 
for improvement.
We measure the effectiveness of our policies and standards by 
monitoring performance data and periodic contract performance 
reviews. Such data may include performance measured against key 
indicators, inspection reports, audit reports and other sources of 
information.
Affected communities (S3)
Many of our operations are located close to communities. We aim 
to be a good neighbour by contributing to their well-being. This 
includes strong community engagement, managing the negative 
impacts of our business and delivering a range of benefits.
Our double materiality assessment has identified social impacts, 
community engagement, security and human rights, and social 
investment and benefits as material topics. See "Material impacts, risks 
and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business 
mode (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of the process to identify 
and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 
354 for more information.
Why it matters
Our business activities have the potential to affect communities directly 
and indirectly. In our operations, many of our facilities are located 
close to where people live and work. We aim to minimise negative 
social and environmental impacts, including by engaging communities 
and providing access to remedy. We also aim to deliver positive 
benefits. Managing our impacts responsibly helps us to maintain our 
reputation and licence to operate.
Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their 
interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 
SBM-3)
Our business activities and the communities in which we operate are 
diverse. Communities most likely to be impacted by our operations are 
those living nearest to our projects or assets. In some locations, 
affected communities may include Indigenous Peoples. The types of 
communities we interact with vary in their socio-economic status, as do 
vulnerable groups within these communities. Depending on the nature 
of our activities and the composition of the local community, groups at 
potentially greater risk of harm may include women, disabled people, 
low-income families, persons without formal land tenure, Indigenous 
Peoples and migrant workers, among others. 
Our understanding of affected communities may be developed through 
means such as direct and indirect engagement, impact assessment and 
concerns received through grievance mechanisms. 
Our activities can have negative and positive impacts on communities 
where we operate. Potential negative impacts include adverse effects 
on the environment, livelihoods, community health and safety, cultural 
heritage and other aspects of socio-economic well-being. These can be 
the result of planned events, such as land use change, traffic, 
environmental impacts or the closure of plants. They can also result 
from unplanned events such as industrial incidents or sabotage.
Our activities contribute positively to local economies through taxes 
and the creation of jobs and opportunities for local businesses. We 
also make social investments in areas determined by local community 
needs and priorities.
Respectful engagement with local communities is critical to the success 
of our projects and long-term operations. Local opposition can result in 
a loss of access to resources or relationships, thereby resulting in 
increased costs or missed business opportunities. Communities can also 
be an enabler of our business, for example by facilitating access to new 
opportunities or as a source of human capital.
The scope of this section includes Shell companies and joint ventures 
where we have operational control and direct relationships with 
affected communities.

---- Page 422 ----
Policies related to affected communities (S3-1)
Our approach to affected communities is governed by our Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards, except where 
otherwise stated. These contain standards for stakeholder engagement, 
managing environmental and social impacts and providing benefits. 
See "SEAM Standards" on page 130 for more information.
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
Stakeholder engagement
Respectful two-way engagement with stakeholders is the foundation 
of our approach. When our assets, projects or businesses have the 
potential to impact communities, our standards require them to plan 
for stakeholder engagement. The intent is to identify community 
stakeholders, determine their needs and expectations, establish an 
appropriate engagement approach and seek feedback on our 
management of impacts. We seek to pay particular attention to groups 
who may be more vulnerable to negative impacts or who require a 
more tailored engagement approach. 
As part of the stakeholder engagement process, our standards require 
the establishment of community feedback mechanisms to receive, 
document and address complaints, questions or requests from local 
stakeholders. These mechanisms are designed to facilitate access to 
remedy for community complaints in line with the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Managing impacts 
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to engage 
stakeholders and to identify and manage potential impacts associated 
with our activities. Our standards also require environmental and social 
management to be put in place to prevent and mitigate adverse 
impacts and enhance positive impacts, with appropriate management 
oversight and resources. 
See "Processes for engaging with affected communities about impacts 
(S3-2)" on page 421 and "Impact assessment" on page 355 for more 
information about our approach.
Managing social impacts
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to apply special 
procedures in situations involving involuntary resettlement, cultural 
heritage, Indigenous Peoples or operations in environments with high 
or unusual social risks. 
Our standards require us to apply a hierarchy of controls to such 
impacts. This means we anticipate and avoid business activity that can 
result in adverse impacts. Where avoidance is not possible, we seek to 
minimise impacts by exploring alternatives in the design of the activity. 
Where residual impacts remain, our standards require management 
plans to be established in line with international standards, including 
where applicable the International Finance Corporation's Performance 
Standards on resettlement, cultural heritage and Indigenous Peoples.
Involuntary resettlement
We sometimes require temporary or permanent access to areas of land 
or sea where people are living or working. These situations can result in 
physical or economic displacement, which need to be carefully 
managed. 
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to avoid 
involuntary resettlement whenever possible. When this cannot be 
avoided, our standards require the development of a resettlement 
action plan or, in cases of economic displacement not resulting in 
physical displacement, a livelihood restoration plan. These plans are 
designed to mitigate the negative impacts of displacement, identify 
development opportunities and establish the entitlements of all 
categories of affected persons (including host communities), with 
particular attention paid to the needs of the poor and the vulnerable. 
In developing these plans, we seek to work with local communities 
to help them resettle and maintain or improve their standard of living. 
Our support may include helping communities to establish alternative 
livelihoods.
Cultural heritage
Preserving cultural heritage is an important part of our efforts to 
manage social impacts. Cultural heritage refers to places of 
archaeological, historical, cultural, artistic or religious significance. 
It can also include preservation of unique environmental features, 
cultural knowledge and traditional lifestyles. 
Our approach starts with considering how to avoid or minimise impacts 
on cultural heritage. This can involve carrying out archaeological 
assessments to inform project design and site selection. If appropriate, 
we may develop so-called "chance find" procedures to deal with 
previously unknown heritage resources that could be discovered during 
construction or operations. Such procedures are important for helping 
to prevent damage to these resources. Where appropriate, we train 
staff and contractors to make them aware of these resources and give 
them the authority to halt work if necessary.
Indigenous Peoples
Our activities can affect Indigenous Peoples who hold specific rights for 
the protection of their cultures, traditional ways of life and special 
connections to land and water. In accordance with the Shell General 
Business Principles and in support of the UN Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, we seek the support and agreement of 
Indigenous Peoples potentially affected by our activities, through 
dialogue, culturally appropriate grievance mechanisms and impact 
management processes.
Shell recognises the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), 
as interpreted by the International Finance Corporation Performance 
Standards as a safeguard for Indigenous Peoples' rights. We believe 
our approach is consistent with the application of this principle while 
respecting the laws of the jurisdictions where we operate.
High or unusual social risks
Our operations can be exposed to social environments where potential 
impacts or risks may be more difficult to manage. Examples include 
areas experiencing conflict, areas where there is a history of community 
grievances leading to protests and business disruption, or areas where 
there are unusually high expectations for community benefits such as 
jobs, contracting opportunities or social investment. 
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses operating in 
environments with high or unusual social risks to obtain specialist 
advice from a qualified expert. The aim of this requirement is to ensure 
that input to local management plans is provided by individuals with 
the necessary expertise.

---- Page 423 ----
Social investment
In countries where our social investment spend exceeds $500,000 per 
year, our standards require a social investment strategy to define goals 
and measurable social outcomes. The strategy documents how projects 
are planned and managed, how alignment with stakeholder and 
business priorities are determined, how project impacts are monitored 
and evaluated, and how the project will transition once Shell's support 
ends. Our standards require project- or asset-level social investment 
plans to align with our country social investment strategy, while 
reflecting local needs and priorities.
Disaster relief
In countries where Shell expects to provide aid in the event of a natural 
or humanitarian disaster, our standards require the development of a 
disaster relief donation plan to predetermine the circumstances in which 
Shell will make donations and how they will be delivered. The intent is 
to enable us to be well prepared for a swift and appropriate response 
to alleviate the impacts of a disaster on communities. This includes 
partners that are preselected and prescreened, allocated budgets 
and agreements that are in place where needed.
Security 
Shell has incorporated the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights (VPSHR) to give guidance on how to respect human rights while 
providing security for business operations. Shell avoids the use of 
armed security except for where there is a requirement under local 
laws or in countries where threats are most severe.
Our standards require country management teams to identify potential 
negative impacts and risks associated with security and human rights in 
line with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. Where 
potential impacts or risks exist, our standards require mitigation actions 
and monitoring of effectiveness. Our standards require incidents or 
allegations to be reported internally and investigated. Our Shipping 
and Maritime business adopts comparable practices for shipping 
operations.
Communities and human rights
Communities are one of Shell's four key focus areas for human rights, 
alongside labour rights, workers in our value chain and security. The 
following human rights commitments are of specific relevance to 
communities.
Communities and human rights
Topic Commitment
Social impacts We manage the social impacts of our business, including 
potential human rights impacts, while working to enhance 
the benefits of our activities for local communities and 
mitigate any negative impacts. Listening and responding 
to community concerns is an important part of our 
approach to providing access to remedy.
Indigenous
Peoples
Our activities can affect Indigenous Peoples who hold 
specific rights for the protection of their culture, traditional 
ways of life and special connections to land and water. 
Shell seeks the support and agreement of Indigenous 
Peoples potentially affected by our activities through 
mutually agreed, transparent and culturally appropriate 
consultation and impact management processes.
Human rights 
defenders
Freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly 
are basic human rights. Their protection contributes to a 
well-functioning society. Shell does not interfere with or 
inhibit the peaceful, lawful and safe activities of human 
rights defenders to exercise these rights. Shell will not 
contribute to or support retaliation, threats, intimidation or 
attacks against those who raise human rights-related 
concerns in relation to our operations.
Shell's standards with respect to affected communities are based on a 
commitment to respect human rights as set out in the UN Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. Our policies with respect to Indigenous Peoples are 
designed to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples.
See "Other disclosures" on page 419 for information about cases of 
non-respect of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the International Labour Organization Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises involving affected communities in our 
operations or our upstream and downstream value chain.
Processes for engaging with affected communities about 
impacts (S3-2) 
We engage with communities throughout the project life cycle. This 
helps us to understand their needs and expectations, obtain input on 
identifying and managing impacts, and provide access to remedy. 
Engagement is a continuous process that helps us improve our decision-
making and performance.
We use communication channels that are appropriate for local 
circumstances to enable effective engagement with community 
members, their legitimate representatives and credible proxies that may 
have insight into their situation. Engagement is an ongoing process. The 
people we engage with, the topics we discuss, and the frequency and 
type of engagement vary across the life cycle and location of our 
business activities.
The manager of a project or asset is accountable for community 
engagement, supported by specialists in community engagement or 
impact management as appropriate. Shell's Vice President for Social 
Performance is responsible for providing Group-level support for 
engagement activities where required.
When planning new projects, we undertake environmental and social 
impact assessments to identify potential impacts on communities. These 
are designed to help us identify and manage potential impacts on the 
environment, livelihoods, health, human rights and other aspects of 
well-being. Impact assessments are usually carried out by specialist 
external consultants, under the supervision of Shell experts.
At each stage of the process, we consider potential impacts and 
decide how best to proceed. We apply the mitigation hierarchy, a 
decision-making framework that helps us to avoid negative impacts 
and, where this is not possible, to minimise, mitigate or restore. When 
negative impacts cannot be avoided through improvements in project 
design, we implement measures to mitigate negative impacts and 
enhance positive impacts. Community involvement is important for 
identifying potential impacts and determining whether mitigations or 
enhancements will have the desired result.
For countries where we have a large community footprint, we 
undertake an annual review process to assess the effectiveness of our 
work with affected communities. This includes testing the effectiveness 
of our engagement approach.
When designing engagements with communities, we prioritise groups 
that will be most impacted or least resilient to negative impacts. 
Depending on the circumstances, we may design tailored engagement 
processes to engage with such groups effectively.

421 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 424 ----
When engaging with Indigenous Peoples, we engage through mutually 
agreed, transparent and culturally appropriate consultation processes. 
Shell recognises the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), 
as interpreted by the International Finance Corporation Performance 
Standards, as a safeguard for Indigenous Peoples' rights.
During construction and operations, we maintain engagement with 
communities about impacts and benefits. When we divest assets or 
exit areas, we collaborate with partners with the aim of leaving a 
positive legacy. 
For non-operated ventures, we use a risk-based approach to determine 
where we need to engage with business partners to support their work 
with affected communities. If necessary, we may offer technical support 
to our partners or undertake direct engagement ourselves.
Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels 
for affected communities to raise concerns (S3-3) 
Engagement with communities is an important part of our approach to 
managing human rights and providing access to remedy. Shell offers 
several channels to encourage affected communities to raise concerns. 
Large projects and assets have dedicated community engagement 
practitioners, who act as a bridge between local communities and 
our operations. We also offer community feedback mechanisms that 
allow us to receive, track and respond to questions and complaints. 
Communities can also raise concerns anonymously through the Shell 
Global Helpline. In locations where third-party-operated complaint 
systems are in place, such as those of a government, we sometimes 
use these to inform us of feedback related to our operations and to 
respond appropriately.
Providing access to remedy
Shell provides and facilitates access to remedy through community 
feedback mechanisms and the Shell Global Helpline. Shell does not 
require individuals or communities to permanently waive their legal 
right to bring a claim through a judicial process as a precondition of 
raising a grievance through a Shell grievance mechanism, nor will 
Shell otherwise take extrajudicial measures to obstruct state-based 
judicial processes. 
Shell will not contribute to or support retaliation, threats, intimidation or 
attacks against those who raise concerns in relation to our operations.
We have assessed our community feedback mechanism against the 
access to remedy criteria of the UN Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights. This has enabled us to improve our approach, 
helping to ensure we treat community feedback consistently across 
our operations, respect anonymity and allow communities to pursue 
other options if they disagree with the outcome of the process. 
In some locations, community members may be employed by suppliers 
who perform work on Shell sites. We have contractual requirements 
for suppliers to provide their own grievance mechanisms (see "Shell 
Supplier Principles" on page 425). Concerns may also be submitted 
via the Shell Global Helpline.
Assessing effectiveness
Our standards require assets, projects or businesses where communities 
are potentially affected to track and respond to questions, complaints 
and feedback. 
For countries where we have a large community footprint, we conduct 
an annual review of the effectiveness of our work with communities. As 
part of this process, we analyse concerns raised through community 
feedback mechanisms to understand opportunities to improve. 
We also evaluate the effectiveness of the mechanism in terms of 
whether it is known, trusted and used. In 2024, we improved our 
internal tools to make it easier to track user satisfaction with the 
remedies afforded by the process.
We seek feedback from communities on the effectiveness of feedback 
mechanisms. Where appropriate, we may involve communities in 
tracking and monitoring how concerns are addressed.
Taking action on material impacts on affected 
communities, and approaches to managing material risks 
and pursuing material opportunities related to affected 
communities, and effectiveness of those actions (S3-4)
In 2024, we continued to take steps to improve our approach to 
managing impacts and supporting access to remedy through 
community feedback mechanisms. 
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell 
companies and joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, unless 
otherwise stated. Many of our actions are of an ongoing nature. 
Horizons for the completion of time-bound actions are indicated 
where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
Building capacity to manage impacts
In 2024, our improvement plan for social performance focused on five 
themes. These comprised work to embed our standards and strengthen 
the integration of social performance into business decisions; support 
local teams to drive continuous improvement; develop the competence 
of staff in critical positions; deepen our understanding of the potential 
community issues associated with changes in our business portfolio; 
and provide risk-based support to our non-operated ventures.
Portfolio changes
For Shell, the energy transition brings new business models that require 
different approaches to social performance. For example, new business 
opportunities in Shell's Renewables and Energy Solutions and Nature 
Based Solutions businesses may require us to work with partners who 
have less experience in managing community impacts such as land 
acquisition or disruption to livelihoods. 
We seek to offer our support and exert a positive influence on non-
operated ventures where we identify a need for additional technical 
expertise or resources.
Indigenous Peoples
Historically, most of Shell's interactions with Indigenous Peoples 
have taken place in highly regulated contexts such as in Canada 
and Australia.
In Australia, our QGC business continues to work on negotiations with 
several Traditional Owner groups to modernise existing Indigenous 
land use agreements. The process has proven challenging, partly owing 
to the need to rebuild trust and confidence between the parties. In 
Alberta, Canada, Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Scotford signed a 
good neighbour agreement with its two closest indigenous 
communities, the Enoch Cree Nation and the Alexander First Nation.
Our potential exposure to Indigenous Peoples issues increasingly extends 
beyond these countries, especially in the context of nature-based 
solutions. For these projects, our standards require certification to the 
Climate, Community and Biodiversity (CCB) Standards or an equivalent, 
which includes requirements around free, prior and informed consent.

---- Page 425 ----
Land acquisition and resettlement
Land acquisition and resettlement is a key focus area across our 
operated and non-operated ventures, and requires specialist skills to 
manage. In 2024, we engaged in plans to manage impacts associated 
with potential economic resettlement in Albania, Norway, South Korea, 
Trinidad and Tobago, and the UK. We also provided support to 
resettlement processes in non-operated ventures in Tanzania, Iraq and 
Brazil. In addition, we supported local assets in the USA and other 
countries with issues related to encroachment.
Cultural heritage
In 2024, projects in Australia, Namibia, Oman and Trinidad and 
Tobago established chance-find procedures in their operations, aligned 
with our standards. We continue to implement cultural heritage 
procedures in our exploration operations in Albania, where several 
significant archaeological discoveries have been made since 2019.
Security 
Our operations expose us to criminality, civil unrest, activism, terrorism, 
cyber disruption and acts of war. We take steps to have clear and 
planned responses to security incidents so that we are able to react 
effectively if they occur. 
Shell is a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights (VPSHR), a multi-stakeholder initiative that gives guidance on 
how to respect human rights while providing security for business 
operations. Shell implements this guidance within our operations, 
concentrating on countries where the risks of working with government 
and private security forces are identified as greatest. 
We carry out annual risk assessments and develop implementation 
plans to manage the identified risks. As part of these plans, we carry 
out training and awareness briefings with the security forces that we 
rely on in our implementation countries. We also screen private security 
providers on VPSHR and monitor their performance.
Social investment
Our activities contribute to economies through taxes, jobs and business 
opportunities. We also make social investments in areas determined by 
local community needs and priorities. These investments are sometimes 
voluntary and sometimes required by governments or as part of a 
contractual agreement.
Shell has three priority areas for social investment: access to energy; 
skills and enterprise development; and science, technology, 
engineering and maths education. In 2024, we spent $165 million 
on social investment, of which $87 million (53%) was required by 
government regulations or contractual agreements. We spent the 
remaining $78 million (47%) on voluntary social investment.
An important part of our social investment is our contribution to 
communities that have been impacted by disasters. Typically, Shell 
provides financial donations to non-governmental and partner 
organisations that are experienced in providing humanitarian aid in 
disaster situations. Where possible and needed, we also contribute 
our products and services, such as fuel, chemical products, transport 
and logistics.
Community skills and enterprise development
Our community skills and enterprise development programmes benefit 
communities where we operate by creating employment opportunities 
and contributing to economic development. These programmes also 
strengthen the number of potential suppliers and staff for our value 
chain. 
Education in science, technology, engineering and maths
We actively support science, technology, engineering and maths 
(STEM) through a range of programmes. NXplorers, our flagship STEM 
programme, aims to help young people develop creative thinking to 
bridge the skills gap.
Local content
See "Local content" on page 426 for information about our approach.
Tracking effectiveness
For countries where we have a large community footprint, we 
undertake an annual review process to assess the effectiveness of our 
work with affected communities. This includes an assessment of how we 
manage negative and positive impacts on communities, undertaken by 
local staff and corporate experts. Social performance issues are 
considered as part of our HSSE & SP internal assurance processes.
Responding to concerns
We may become aware of actual or potential negative impacts 
through impact assessment, stakeholder engagement or concerns 
raised through community feedback mechanisms. Depending on the 
nature of the issue, we may investigate the concern ourselves or refer it 
to a third party if appropriate.
If an incident is confirmed, we review the circumstances and decide on 
the action to be taken. When the impacts are preventable or 
remediable, we may consider appropriate measures. Such measures 
may be taken on our own or in conjunction with others. When actual or 
potential impacts arise in relation to topics such as impact management 
or land acquisition, we aim to ensure our standards are implemented in 
an appropriate manner.
See "Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for 
affected communities to raise concerns (S3-3)" on page 422 for further 
information about our approach to access to remedy.
Other disclosures
Shell seeks to avoid or minimise material adverse impacts on affected 
communities by embedding respect for their rights in our policies and 
practices. Shell is committed to respecting human rights as set out in the 
UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. We provide and facilitate access to 
remedy.
Our policies on impact assessment, environmental management and 
communities are designed to manage the impacts of our activities. See 
"Policies related to affected communities (S3-1)" on page 420 and 
"Communities and human rights" on page 421 for more information.
An incident is a legal action or complaint registered with the undertaking 
or competent authorities through a formal process, or an instance of non-
compliance identified by the undertaking through established 
procedures. According to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, a severe human rights incident is characterised by the 
significant impact it may have, which is evaluated based on its scale, 
scope and irremediable nature. An incident may be severe by virtue of 
one or more of these criteria. 
In 2024, no severe human rights incidents connected to affected 
communities were identified. No severe human rights incidents 
connected with land disputes or free prior and informed consent 
of Indigenous Peoples were identified.

---- Page 426 ----
In 2024, no cases of non-respect of the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises connected to affected communities were identified in our 
operations or our upstream and downstream value chain.
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant to 
them based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to social performance is 
supported by members of Shell's Corporate Relations and Safety, 
Environment and Asset Management function. These include experts in 
community engagement, resettlement, Indigenous Peoples, human 
rights, impact assessment and other disciplines. The requirements of our 
standards are communicated to people involved with implementation 
through various mechanisms, including internal communication 
channels, management systems and training as appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮manage stakeholder engagement, impact management, involuntary 
resettlement, cultural heritage, Indigenous Peoples, high or unusual 
social risks, social investment, disaster relief, and security and human 
rights in line with our standards; and
￮ support efforts to provide access to remedy for affected communities 
through community feedback mechanisms.
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations or 
our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated above 
represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets related to managing material negative impacts, 
advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks 
and opportunities (S3-5)
Our business activities and the communities in which we operate are 
diverse. Experience shows that local goals drive more appropriate 
outcomes than globally aggregated targets, which may or may not be 
applicable to every community. For this reason, we have not adopted 
consolidated targets on affected communities at a Group level.
We aim for continuous improvement in our performance and may set 
goals at a local level addressing specific priorities, such as reducing 
road traffic or enhancing local recruitment and contracting. Such goals 
may include performance measurement from a base period to a future 
period. Where appropriate, we engage directly with affected 
communities to discuss the local priorities. In some cases, this may 
involve community participation in setting goals, monitoring progress, 
identifying lessons learned or further opportunities for improvement.

Governance | Business conduct (G1) 
Our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people, 
as well as our focus on safety and sustainability, are critical 
to our strategy.
Our double materiality assessment has identified a culture of integrity 
and responsible sourcing as material topics. It has also identified tax 
and payments to governments and safety as material entity-specific 
topics, which we cover in this section in recognition of their overarching 
relevance for Shell's activities. See "Material impacts, risks and 
opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model 
(SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description of the process to identify and 
assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 
for more information.
Why it matters
Our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people underpin 
our work with employees, customers, investors, contractors, suppliers, 
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the communities where we 
operate and others. We are committed to doing business in an ethical 
and transparent way.
Business conduct policies and corporate culture (G1-1)
Our core values underpin our work with employees, customers, investors, 
contractors, suppliers, NGOs, the communities where we operate and 
others. The Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct and 
Ethics and Compliance Manual help everyone at Shell to act in line 
with our values.
The Shell General Business Principles set out our responsibilities to 
shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and society. 
They set the standards for how we conduct business with honesty, 
integrity and respect for people. As part of these principles, we commit 
to contribute to sustainable development, by balancing short- and long-
term interests and integrating economic, environmental and social 
considerations into our decision-making. All Shell employees and 
contractors, and those at joint ventures we operate, are expected 
to behave in line with these business principles.
The Shell Code of Conduct explains how employees, contractors and 
anyone else acting on behalf of Shell must behave to live up to our 
business principles. It covers safety, anti-bribery and corruption, fair 
competition, human rights and other important areas.
The Shell Ethics and Compliance Manual defines the detailed 
requirements for businesses and functions to comply with laws on
anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, preventing the 
facilitation of tax evasion, antitrust, data privacy and trade compliance.
Shell employees, contractors and third parties can report potential 
breaches of the Code of Conduct confidentially through several 
channels, including anonymously through the Shell Global Helpline.
We maintain a stringent no retaliation policy to protect any person 
making an allegation in good faith. This protection extends to those 
who participate in or conduct an investigation. We investigate 
allegations of potential violations of the Shell Code of Conduct or 
applicable laws promptly and independently of the management 
line concerned.
Our policies require Shell staff to undergo appropriate ethics and 
compliance training. The type and depth of training is dependent 
on the level of risk. Training is repeated every three years, or more 
frequently for positions where the risk exposure is higher. Functions 
considered to be at higher risk for exposure to bribery include, but are 
not limited to, persons involved in procurement and contracting, new 
business development and engagement with government officials. Staff 
involved in receiving and investigating potential breaches of the Code 
of Conduct undergo specific training in managing such cases.
See the conduct and culture risks highlighted in "Risk factors" on pages 
135-144 for additional information on how Shell seeks to establish, 
develop, promote and evaluate our corporate culture.
See "Animal testing" on page 392 for information about Shell's animal 
welfare standards.
Management of relationships with suppliers (G1-2)
As part of Shell's responsible sourcing approach, we aim to work with 
suppliers that behave in an economically, environmentally and socially 
responsible manner. 
Shell Supplier Principles
Shell partners with suppliers who adhere to our Shell General Business 
Principles and Shell Supplier Principles. Our standard contract terms 
require adherence to these or equivalent principles. 
The Shell Supplier Principles apply to contracts managed by Shell's 
Supply Chain organisation, which generally manages procurement of 
non-hydrocarbon goods and services on behalf of Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator.
Our Supplier Principles comprise the following topics:
￮ Business Integrity: compliance with Shell standards and applicable 
laws and regulations, including with respect to corruption, bribery, 
competition and conflicts of interest.
￮ Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE 
& SP): a systematic approach to managing health, safety, security 
and environment, including environmental protection, energy and 
resource efficiency, managing social impacts, and respectful 
engagement with employees, communities and other stakeholders.
￮ Labour and Human Rights: respect for human rights and labour 
rights, including no use of forced labour or child labour; no payment 
of recruitment fees by workers; compliance with applicable laws on 
freedom of association and collective bargaining; no tolerance for 
harassment, discrimination or retaliation; compliance with applicable 
laws on working hours; wages and benefits that meet or exceed 
national legal standards; and grievance mechanisms where concerns 
can be raised confidentially. 
Suppliers are required to notify Shell in case of any violations of the 
Shell General Business Principles or the Shell Supplier Principles.
Shell evaluates and selects its suppliers based on, among other things, 
the following considerations: capability to act in accordance with the 
Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles, clear 
financial position, technical capability of delivering in line with Shell 
standards, and ability to deliver the scope of work safely and manage 
human rights and worker welfare within their own operations and 
respective supply chains.
After the initial assessment of potential suppliers, we may carry out 
additional risk assessments. These can trigger further assessment of 
suppliers' capability on topics such as worker welfare and ethics and 
compliance. Depending on the risk profile, suppliers may be asked to 
put mitigation actions in place.
Our purchases of goods and services, including from small and 
medium-sized enterprises, are governed by standard contractual 
terms and conditions. These specify the scope of the contract, the 
responsibilities of the parties to each other and processes for payment. 
Sustainability Statements
425 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 428 ----
Our standard terms require suppliers to issue an invoice once the 
agreed goods or services have been satisfactorily delivered and 
accepted by Shell. We aim to pay any undisputed amounts within 
the time period specified in the contract after receiving a correct 
and adequately supported invoice.
Enhanced value chain due diligence
In 2024, we took steps to strengthen our human rights due diligence 
processes for sourcing goods and services. We have introduced a new 
policy within our Category Management and Contracting Process 
Framework requiring additional due diligence for new contracts with 
higher potential for human rights impacts. See "Enhanced value chain 
due diligence" on page 416.
Local content
We want to make a positive difference to countries and local 
communities where we operate. We do this by creating jobs, training 
people, supporting local businesses and buying goods and services 
from local suppliers — collectively referred to as local content. We also 
work to include in our supply chain enterprises that are part of 
historically under-represented or underserved groups.
Prevention and detection of corruption and bribery (G1-3)
The Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct and Ethics and 
Compliance Manual define our requirements for complying with laws 
on anti-bribery and corruption. These requirements apply to all Shell-
operated ventures and companies in which Shell holds a controlling 
interest, either directly or indirectly.
Our approach
To help us prevent and detect corruption and bribery, we require our 
business and functions to undertake regular risk reviews and implement 
risk-based controls. We identify roles that are exposed to potential 
bribery and corruption risks and provide training. We require ethics 
and compliance due diligence when contracting, engaging in business 
development, before funding social investment and before entering 
into relationships with trade associations. We also include ethics 
and compliance clauses in our contracts.
Specialists in our Business Integrity Department and Human Resources 
function manage investigations when concerns are raised. Independent 
audits are conducted by Shell Internal Audit and Investigations (SIAI).
Raising and investigating concerns
If staff wish to report a concern, they may speak to their line manager, 
the Shell Ethics and Compliance Office (SECO) or a representative of 
the Human Resources or Legal functions. Alternatively, staff and third 
parties can contact the Shell Global Helpline, which is available to 
anyone, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via telephone or the 
internet. Reports can be made anonymously and in multiple languages.
Shell has a professional Business Integrity Department that investigates 
allegations of potential violations of the Shell Code of Conduct. This 
function operates independently from the management line under 
investigation. We conduct investigations according to six investigation 
principles: confidentiality, impartiality, integrity, competence, timeliness 
and protection from retaliation. Only trained members of the Business 
Integrity Department and Human Resources function have the authority 
to direct, manage or conduct such investigations. 
Each quarter, the Business Integrity Department reports on Code of 
Conduct incidents to the Business Integrity Committee, Executive 
Committee (EC) and the Board Audit and Risk Committee (ARC). Ethics 
and compliance officers review cases, investigation outcomes, trends, 
learnings and follow-up actions. Shell's Chief Ethics and Compliance 
Officer (CECO) reports to the EC and ARC on compliance with the 
application of the investigation principles and overall consistency of our 
approach. See "Audit and Risk Committee Report — Compliance and 
Governance" on page 183 for more information.
Shell Internal Audit and Investigations (SIAI) provides independent and 
objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk 
management and internal controls. SIAI conducts investigations of 
corporate irregularities raised through the Shell Global Helpline and 
produces causal analysis and learning on business incidents.
See "The role of the administrative, management and supervisory 
bodies (GOV-1)" on page 345 for information about the governance 
of ethics and compliance.
Training
Ethics and compliance training in Shell follows a risk-based approach, 
with the depth of training required of staff dependent on the level of 
risk associated with their role. 
Staff must complete all assigned Shell ethics and compliance training 
courses. Code of Conduct training, which explains the behaviour Shell 
expects from its representatives, is mandatory for all employees and 
contractor staff.
Certain roles pose higher risks for corruption or bribery owing to the 
sensitive nature of the transactions involved or because they entail 
engagement with government officials. We prioritise additional training 
for these roles.
We require all staff in roles identified as being potentially at risk for 
exposure to corruption or bribery to undergo appropriate training. 
Training completion is tracked and repetition cycles are defined. 
Training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption is valid for three years from 
the date of completion but may be refreshed more frequently, for 
instance in response to changes in the risk environment. In 2024, 98% 
of staff in at-risk roles possessed a valid training completion in line with 
the applicable cycle.
We offer free training in anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices 
to selected suppliers. This training is available in 14 languages. 
The Board endorses the Shell ethics and compliance programme 
including the required training programmes. An Ethics and Compliance 
Learning Board, chaired by the CECO, makes decisions on strategic 
direction and how we run effective training. Anti-bribery and corruption 
is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure content is relevant and up 
to date.
Communicating our expectations
Shell's policies on ethics and compliance are communicated to 
employees, suppliers and third parties at the start of any contractual 
relationships and through training, leadership communications and 
Shell's website. Our Code of Conduct and associated training are 
offered in multiple languages with the aim of making our expectations 
clear and easy to understand.

Incidents of corruption or bribery (G1-4)
No Shell company, and to the best of our knowledge, no Shell staff 
were convicted or fined for criminal violations of anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery laws in 2024. 
We review cases involving alleged violations of anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery to identify lessons learned and improve our internal 
processes. We take appropriate steps when violations are 
substantiated, which can include consequence management 
and other actions.
Actions and resources
In 2024, we continued to manage ethics and compliance through 
our policies and systems. This included implementing the detailed 
requirements of the Ethics and Compliance Manual, providing training, 
maintaining risk-based compliance programmes and encouraging 
people to discuss the dilemmas they face in their work. We will 
continue these activities in 2025.
We have not adopted consolidated targets for ethics and compliance. 
We track the effectiveness of our policies and actions through data and 
insights from the Shell Global Helpline, the Shell Ethics and Compliance 
organisation and the Shell People Survey.
Accountability for ethics and compliance in Shell lies with the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Executive Committee. Implementation is 
supported by Shell's Ethics and Compliance Office, which includes 
subject matter experts in business ethics and compliance.
Tax and other payments 
to governments
One of the ways Shell makes a meaningful financial contribution to 
the countries where we operate is by paying taxes. Our operations 
generate revenues for governments through the taxes and royalties 
we pay, which are often used to fund essential public services.
Our double materiality assessment has identified tax and other 
payments to governments as a material entity-specific topic. See 
"Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with 
strategy and business mode (SBM-3)" on page 351 and "Description 
of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more information.
Why it matters
When we invest in a country, we seek to build long-term relationships 
and develop our business sustainably. We recognise our responsibility 
towards investors, governments, employees and the local communities 
we are part of. Revenue transparency and the taxes we collect and 
pay are one of the ways we fulfil this responsibility.
Our approach to tax is designed to support our strategy through our 
commitment to transparency, compliance and open dialogue with our 
stakeholders, from governments to civil society. 
The Board of Directors of Shell plc approves our tax strategy, reviews 
its effectiveness and maintains sound internal controls.

Policies related to tax
The B Team Responsible Tax Principles were developed by companies, including Shell, civil society, investors and representatives from international 
institutions. We adopted The B Team Responsible Tax Principles as our own. The Shell Responsible Tax Principles guide our decisions on tax matters.
Actions and resources
In 2024, Shell paid $12,459 million in corporate income taxes and 
$5,737 million in government royalties. We also collected excise 
duties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and other products on 
behalf of governments.
We publish an annual Tax Contribution Report which sets out the 
corporate income tax that Shell companies paid in the jurisdictions 
where we have a taxable presence. Shell also publishes an annual 
Payments to Governments report, prepared in accordance with the 
UK's Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as 
amended in December 2015). This report is also published pursuant to 
article 5:25e of the Dutch FMSA (Wft) and is furnished with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission according to Section 13(q) under 
the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
We regularly engage with policymakers to support the development of 
tax rules and regulations. In this way, we hope to contribute to the 
development of fair, effective and stable tax systems. We also provide 
constructive input to industry groups and international organisations, 
such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, The B Team 
Responsible Tax Working Group and the international business 
network Business at OECD.
The Board of Directors of Shell plc approves our tax strategy, reviews 
its effectiveness and maintains sound internal controls. The Executive 
Vice President Taxation and Corporate Structure is responsible for tax 
matters and provides assurance based on our tax control framework. 
Implementation is supported by members of Shell's Finance function, 
which includes subject matter experts on various aspects of tax. In 
2025, we will continue to be guided by the Shell Responsible Tax 
Principles in our tax-related activities.
We have not adopted consolidated targets for this topic. We track the 
effectiveness of our policies and actions through regular monitoring and 
review of our financial, operational and compliance controls, including 
tax controls.

Safety
Safety, along with our core values, underpins our strategy.
We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across 
our operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.
Our double materiality assessment has identified safety as a material 
entity-specific topic. See "Material impacts, risks and opportunities and 
their interaction with strategy and business model (SBM-3)" on page 
351 and "Description of the process to identify and assess material 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)" on page 354 for more 
information.
Why it matters
The nature of our operations exposes us to a wide range of safety risks. 
We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any 
incident, with a particular emphasis on the risks with the most serious 
consequences if something goes wrong. 
We seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where risks 
associated with our activities are highest: personal, process and 
transport. 
Personal safety in Shell refers to occupational hazards associated with 
building, maintaining or operating our facilities. Process safety is about 
keeping hazardous substances inside pipes, tanks and vessels, and 
ensuring that well fluids are contained during construction, well 
interventions (such as maintenance) and operations. Transport safety 
concerns hazards associated with transporting people, products or 
equipment by road, sea, air and rail.
Policies related to safety
Our approach to safety is governed by the Shell Commitment and 
Policy on Health, Security, Safety, the Environment and Social 
Performance (HSSE & SP). It sets out our expectations for the 
management of HSSE & SP and applies to all Shell companies, 
contractors and joint ventures under our operational control. 
We translate the Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP into 
action through our Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
(SEAM) Standards. The SEAM Standards set out our requirements for 
personal safety, process safety, transport safety and emergency 
response (see "SEAM Standards" on page 130).
The standards described in this section apply to Shell companies and 
joint ventures in which Shell is the operator, except where otherwise 
stated. We expect non-operated joint ventures to adopt appropriate 
and acceptable policies to manage their risks.
Management systems 
Our standards require a systematic approach to managing HSSE & SP. 
The foundation of this approach is our management system.
The SEAM HSSE & SP and Asset Management Foundations Standard 
sets the requirements for the core elements of our management system. 
It covers topics such as establishing an organisation to manage HSSE 
& SP, management accountabilities and responsibilities, assurance, 
competence management, performance monitoring and continuous 
learning and improvement. The standard also specifies core processes 
such as risk management, management of HSSE & SP through a 
hierarchy of controls, permit to work and management of change. It 
also sets out our requirements for HSSE & SP in joint ventures, capital 
projects, acquisitions and divestments.
Contractor HSSE management
When contracting for goods and services, our standards require assets 
or businesses to specify the activities in the contracted scope of work 
and to determine the associated level of HSSE risk. Our standards 
require verification that the supplier is capable of managing the HSSE 
risks in the contract scope.
Our standards require HSSE requirements to be established in 
contracts. These requirements formalise our expectations for HSSE risk 
management associated with the contracted scope and the supplier's 
capability to manage those risks. Based on the contract scope, the 
assessed risk, and the capability of the supplier, a contract mode is 
determined which describes the HSSE risk management responsibility 
of Shell and the supplier, which in turn determines the HSSE 
management system applicable in controlling each risk.
Our standards require suppliers to demonstrate readiness to implement 
HSSE risk management before starting work. Our standards also 
require assets or businesses to assure effective implementation of HSSE 
risk management and to conduct performance management against 
contractual requirements.
The above requirements apply to contracts providing goods or services 
to the company with the exception of non-differentiated goods and 
services which are of a standard nature, common to all customers, 
where it is not practically possible to impose and verify effectiveness of 
additional requirements or controls to manage HSSE risks beyond the 
Shell Supplier Principles. See "Shell Supplier Principles" on page 425 
for more information.
Personal safety
The SEAM Workplace Health, Safety and Security Standard 
establishes requirements for occupational health and safety hazards 
that have the potential to result in harm to people.
Examples include standards to manage control of work, working in 
confined spaces, diving and tunnelling operations, electrical safety, 
excavation, hot work, ionising radiation, lifting and hoisting, personal 
protective equipment, safe isolation and working at heights. Additional 
standards cover building safety, business travel, company-sponsored 
events, health hazard management, product stewardship, fatigue risk 
management, fitness to work, human factors management and security.
Process safety
The SEAM Process Safety and Asset Management Standard 
establishes requirements from project design and construction 
throughout the life cycle to keep sites, employees, contractors and 
communities safe.
The standard defines our requirements for the identification of process 
safety hazards and the design of controls to prevent the release of the 
identified hazards. In the event of a spill or a leak, our standards 
require the use of independent recovery measures to reduce the 
likelihood of a release becoming catastrophic. We regularly inspect, 
test and maintain these barriers so that they meet our standards.
Transport safety
The SEAM Transport Safety Standard sets out our requirements for 
road, rail, sea and air transport.
Road safety
Our standards define requirements for managing risks related to road 
transport. Examples of topics covered by these standards include 
vehicle specifications and inspection, training and qualification for 
drivers, journey management and fatigue risk management. Our 
standards align with industry standards for land transport safety 
published by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers.
Sustainability Statements | Governance
429 Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2024

---- Page 432 ----
Maritime safety
Our standards define requirements for managing risks related to 
maritime operations. These cover the use of cargo transport vessels and 
support vessels, ports and berths, and the operation of facilities with 
maritime interfaces. Our procedures include positive vetting for cargo 
transport vessels and support vessels. We require double hulls for bulk 
liquid transport in vessels of 600 deadweight tonnes and above. We 
maintain detailed procedures for managing maritime risks associated 
with floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO) and 
floating storage and offloading units (FSO).
Air safety
Our standards, which incorporate the requirements of the International 
Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) Industry Air Transport 
Requirements, define requirements for managing risks related to aircraft 
operations, covering fixed wing, rotary, remotely piloted airborne 
systems and drone operations. Our procedures include processes for 
assessing aircraft operators used for Shell-owned, chartered or other 
contracted air transport operations. We only use aircraft types and 
aircraft operators that have been assessed as acceptable based on 
our standards. 
Rail safety
Our standards define requirements for managing risks related to rail 
operations. These include requirements for procedures, controls and 
mitigations to manage risks associated with rail operations. 
Emergency response
The SEAM Standards set out our requirements for emergency response, 
oil spill response and medical emergencies. These standards are 
designed to ensure that we are appropriately prepared to respond 
to all credible emergency and worst-case spill scenarios.
Our standards require assets and businesses to understand the 
potential emergencies that could happen as a result of our operations 
and develop plans to respond to these scenarios. 
Our standards require asset and business incident management teams 
to be trained and to exercise the response plans regularly. These 
exercises often involve working closely with local emergency services 
and regulatory agencies to jointly ensure our capability to respond to 
an incident.
Our emergency and spill response plans and procedures are driven 
by our internal risk management processes and local regulatory 
requirements. Our standards require alignment with industry 
emergency and spill management systems to facilitate inter-
organisational collaboration by responders.
Actions and resources 
The scope of the actions described in this section covers Shell's 
operated businesses unless otherwise stated. Many of our actions are 
of an ongoing nature. Schedules for the completion of time-bound 
actions are indicated where applicable.
Our actions are intended to help us achieve the desired outcome of 
our policies and standards by providing resources and expertise that 
support our businesses to implement them in fit-for-purpose ways.
Our multi-year process of refreshing our approach to safety for all 
employees and contractors started in 2020. This approach is rooted 
in a consistent focus on human performance. We ask people at Shell 
to apply a learner mindset, by which we mean the belief that we can 
always improve, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes 
and successes, and speak up freely without repercussions.
In practice, our refreshed approach to safety is about enhancing 
how we prepare for and conduct high-risk activities by:
￮improving our preparation and execution of frontline work, building 
an environment of trust and learning;
￮ moving to industry-wide tools so that Shell and contractors work 
on the same basis to manage risks; and 
￮ using technology to reduce exposure and identify conditions that 
could lead to serious incidents.
It is also about capturing more insights by: 
￮focusing on serious injuries, illness and fatalities (SIF) and the lessons 
we can derive from high-potential incidents where the most serious 
consequences that could have led to SIF did not materialise;
￮ focusing on learning from losses or potential losses of containment, 
and on any degradation of barriers designed to prevent or minimise 
the consequences of leaks;
￮ capturing underlying causes through incident investigations; and 
￮ embedding lessons learned in our training and instructions for 
future work.
In 2024, we continued to integrate this approach into the plans of our 
facilities, projects and functions. Some of our non-operated ventures 
have also chosen to implement elements of our refreshed approach.
Personal safety
When our employees and contractors perform tasks, we expect them 
to consider the hazards that could potentially cause serious harm and 
the effectiveness of the barriers in place to avoid serious harm. We 
establish and maintain competence management systems to ensure 
people are competent to perform their roles and responsibilities. 
We run safety awareness programmes and hold an annual global 
Safety Day to give employees and contractors time to discuss safety 
culture on the frontline, and reflect on how to prevent incidents and 
how to improve performance. In 2024, the focus was on "Before I start 
work", which means pausing to reflect on what needs to be in place 
before we start work, for that work to be done safely.
Working with others
We work with contractors and suppliers to help them understand our 
requirements for managing risk and operating safely. We strive to help 
improve the energy industry's safety performance by sharing safety 
standards and experience with other operators, joint venture partners, 
contractors and professional organisations.
In 2024, senior executives from more than 20 of our major contractors 
joined Shell executives in Houston, Texas, for our annual Contractor 
Safety Leadership workshop. Discussion focused on preventing fatal 
and life-changing injuries through a focus on human performance, 
learning from and improving normal work, mental well-being, and 
worker welfare. Additionally, we support industry safe work coalitions 
in the oil products terminal sector and maritime sector with safety-
specific work groups and regional conferences.
We also work with industry organisations to develop standards and 
practices supporting safe and disciplined operations. Some of the 
organisations we work with include the International Association of 
Oil & Gas Producers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Center 
for Chemical Process Safety, and the Energy Institute.

---- Page 433 ----
Process safety
In 2024, we continued to focus on strengthening our core work 
processes to improve the health of the human and technical barriers 
that help us to prevent process safety incidents and to recover 
effectively if they occur. 
Our key focus areas are to standardise our risk assessment tools, 
embed human performance in frontline work execution and shift to 
performance indicators that help us better identify the preconditions 
that can lead to incidents, with a greater emphasis on risk potential.
We continued to embed our Process Safety Fundamentals, a set of 10 
good operating practices that help us strengthen asset integrity and 
process safety. We also conducted work to better understand potential 
process safety risks associated with new business activities such as 
hydrogen, ammonia and carbon capture and storage.
Also in 2024, we continued to learn from investigations into industry 
incidents and embed this knowledge into our process safety standards 
and our training programmes. Such learning helps us to better 
understand the causes of process safety incidents so that we can 
improve our controls to prevent them from occurring.
Transport safety
In 2024, we continued to embed our standards. We worked with 
specialist contractors, industry bodies, non-governmental organisations 
and governments to find ways of reducing transport safety risks. 
We also took specific actions on road safety, aviation safety and 
maritime safety.
Road safety
In 2024, we continued to focus on strengthening our controls and 
implementing technology solutions that help us to better detect the 
conditions which can lead to accidents.
Our standards require Shell employees and contractors who are 
identified as driving on work-related business to receive defensive 
driver training. 
We are installing active fatigue and distraction detection (AFDD) 
devices in vehicles operated by Shell or our contractors in countries 
where road transport risks are highest. These devices help us detect 
the conditions that can lead to accidents, which allows for earlier 
intervention to improve prevention. The AFDD devices have recorded 
and intervened in high-risk fatigue events, to prevent what could have 
resulted in motor vehicle incidents if the devices had not alerted 
the drivers.
Maritime safety
At the end of 2024, we managed and operated a global fleet of 22 
tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and the world's first liquefied 
hydrogen carrier. We are one of the world's largest charterers of oil 
and gas vessels. We work with our global maritime partners through 
our Maritime Partners in Safety Programme to improve the safety 
performance of the shipping industry.
Air safety
In 2024, for Shell-operated ventures, our owned and contracted 
aircraft flew around 37,000 hours and carried around 292,000 Shell 
and contractor passengers to destinations across the world. In 
addition, remotely piloted aircraft completed flights on surveys, 
inspections, emissions surveillance, and security and incident response.
Emergency response
In 2024, we held large-scale emergency response exercises at Shell 
Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands and in Perth, 
Australia for offshore exploration to support our Prelude floating LNG 
facility.
We manage three regional Emergency Response Leadership Councils 
for the Americas; Asia–Pacific; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
The councils bring together experts from different teams that need to be 
able to work together seamlessly in case of emergencies. In 2024, the 
councils held annual conferences in each region that covered a variety 
of topics such as lessons learned, dynamic risk assessments, new 
response technology, non-fluorinated firefighting foam tactics and 
response preparedness.
We continued to be involved in industry consortia to improve well-
containment capabilities such as the Marine Well Containment 
Company for the Gulf of America region and Oil Spill Response 
Limited, a global industry consortium. For oil spills, we have created a 
global response support network that enables us to deal more 
effectively with oil spills, by supplementing local response capability. 
Resourcing our actions
The Executive Vice President for Safety, Environment and Asset 
Management is the most senior executive in Shell with accountability 
for the development, governance and oversight of the SEAM 
Standards. Leaders of assets, performance units, businesses or functions 
are accountable for assessing which SEAM Standards are relevant 
based on their objectives, risk profile and activities, and for 
implementing those standards as appropriate.
Implementation of SEAM Standards relevant to safety is supported by 
members of Shell's Safety, Environment and Asset Management 
function, which includes subject matter experts in personal safety, 
process safety, transport safety and other disciplines. The requirements 
of our standards are communicated to people involved with 
implementation through various mechanisms, including internal 
communication channels, management systems and training as 
appropriate.
Planned actions
In 2025, we will continue to:
￮manage personal safety, process safety, transport safety and 
emergency response in line with our standards; 
￮ collaborate with peers and industry partners to drive continuous 
improvement in safety performance; and
￮ further mature and embed our refreshed approach to safety.
Our action plans are responsive to changing business conditions. 
Planned actions not directly related to compliance with regulations 
or our own standards are subject to change. The actions indicated 
above represent key focus areas rather than an exhaustive list.
Targets
We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across our 
operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.
Although we do not have consolidated targets for safety at a Group 
level that meet the criteria set out by the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS), we consider our Goal Zero ambition to 
be fundamental to the success of our company. We therefore track our 
performance through the metrics provided under "Safety performance" 
below and through our efforts to learn from incidents to understand 
underlying causes, including technical, behavioural, organisational 
and human factors.

Personal safety and health
Tragically, two of our contractor colleagues in Shell-operated ventures 
lost their lives in incidents which happened in 2024 while working for 
us. One contractor colleague in the Netherlands lost his life in an 
accident at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Moerdijk in June 2024. 
Another contractor colleague in India was bitten by a snake in May 
2024 and subsequently passed away in January 2025.
We sadly note that a contractor who sustained burn injuries in a flash 
fire at our EcoOils facility in Malaysia in February 2025 passed away 
later that month. The investigation into the incident remained under 
way at the time of publishing this report. 
The death in February 2024 of a contractor colleague in Nigeria, who 
was injured in a fire incident in December 2023, was reported in our 
2023 Annual Report.
Shell is profoundly impacted by these losses. We are resolutely 
committed to learn from these incidents and we aim to take all 
necessary measures to prevent anything similar from happening again. 
We continue to work closely with our contractors to help build a strong 
safety culture at the frontline.
We use serious injury, illness and fatality (SIF) and serious injury, illness 
and fatality frequency (SIF-F) to measure our safety performance. SIF 
is defined as a serious work-related injury or illness that resulted in a 
fatality or a permanent impairment, which is defined as a long-term or 
permanent injury or illness with a significant impact on daily activities. 
SIF-F is calculated by dividing the number of employee and contractor 
SIF by 100 million working hours. SIF-F enables us to focus our 
investigations on the most serious incidents. The aim is to collect 
and analyse relevant, high-quality data that can help us improve 
our efforts to prevent serious injuries and fatalities.
In 2024, the number of serious work-related injuries or illnesses, 
including those that resulted in fatality or permanent impairment, 
decreased to 7 from 12 in 2023. The SIF-F was 1.5 cases per 100 
million working hours compared with 2.6 in 2023. 
In 2024, the number of injuries per million working hours — the total 
recordable case frequency — was 1.1 compared with 1.1 in 2023. The 
number of injuries that led to time off work per million working hours — the 
lost time injury frequency — was 0.5 in 2024 compared with 0.5 in 2023. 
Process safety
Our process safety performance in 2024 is shown below.
Process safety performance

Operational process safety events [A] [B] 90
Tier 1 30
Tier 2 60
[A] A Tier 1 process safety event is an unplanned or uncontrolled release of any material from 
a process, including non-toxic and non-flammable materials, with the greatest actual 
consequence resulting in harm to employees, contract staff or a neighbouring community, 
damage to equipment, or exceeding a defined threshold quantity. A Tier 2 process safety 
event is a release of lesser consequence. Process safety events are classified according to 
guidance from the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers and the American 
Petroleum Institute (API 754 3rd edition).
[B] Excludes sabotage-related process safety events. In 2024, there were two Tier 1 sabotage-
related events. The classification of sabotage-related process safety events is made on a 
best-endeavours basis.
The number of Tier 1 and 2 operational process safety events in 2024 
increased compared with 2023. There were 90 events reported during 
the year compared with 63 in 2023. The increase in process safety 
tiered events was driven by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy 
Solutions business. We are actively addressing these challenges by 
refining our operational strategies, renewing our focus on fundamentals 
and leveraging new technologies to return to the downward trend of 
previous years.
A well control incident is defined as a well set-up with fewer than two 
barriers in place to protect it against a release through any potential 
path. In 2024, there were no Level 1 or Level 2 well control incidents 
in Shell-operated ventures. There were also no events in 2023.
Process safety events related to crude theft and sabotage in Nigeria 
are recorded separately. In Nigeria, there were two such events in 
2024, compared with two in 2023. See "SPDC JV - Nigeria: Spills 
caused by crude theft and sabotage" on page 433 for more 
information.

Spills
We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention 
of preventing spills. To minimise the risk of spills, Shell has routine 
programmes and technologies in place to help reduce failures and 
maintain the reliability of facilities and pipelines. However, spills can 
still occur for reasons such as operational failure, accidents, unusual 
corrosion or theft or sabotage. Our spills performance in 2024 is 
shown below.
Spills [A]
unit 2024
Operational spills number 69
Nigeria [B] number 20
Rest of the world number 49

Nigeria [B] thousand tonnes 0.37
Rest of the world thousand tonnes 0.86
Sabotage spills [C] number 84
Sabotage spills - volume [C] thousand tonnes 2.0
[A] All spill volumes and numbers are for hydrocarbon spills of more than 100 kilograms to the 
environment (land or water). Operational and sabotage total volumes include the total 
amount of the spill that reached the environment, not correcting for any amounts 
subsequently recovered, evaporated or otherwise lost.
[B] In 2024, Nigeria includes SPDC JV operations only.
[C] All theft or sabotage-related spills in 2024 occurred in Nigeria.
In 2024, there were 69 operational spills of more than 100 kilograms 
compared with 71 in 2023 (restated from 70 operational spills of more 
than 100 kilograms following a review of the performance data). The 
volume of operational spills of oil and oil products in 2024 was 1.23 
thousand tonnes, compared with 0.37 thousand tonnes in 2023. The 
increase in operational spill volumes is partly attributable to a spill that 
occurred during severe weather in the Gulf of America, as well as 
incidents in Singapore, Canada and Nigeria. 
Spills in Nigeria
SPDC JV - Nigeria: Operational spills
In 2024, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria 
Limited (SPDC) [A], as operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV, 
Shell interest 30%), reported 20 operational spill incidents of more 
than 100 kilograms of crude oil, compared with 9 reported in 2023. 
The increase in the number of operational spill incidents was largely 
because of a rise in cases of failure due to factory defects in a locally 
manufactured clamp used in pipeline repairs following the removal of 
illegal connections. The company that manufactured the clamps has 
recalled the affected batch, and SPDC has commenced the 
replacement of the clamps. 
In 2024, the volume of operational spills of oil and oil products was 
0.37 thousand tonnes compared with 0.005 thousand tonnes reported 
in 2023. The majority (89%) of the 2024 volume relates to two 
significant incidents, one onshore on the Trans Niger Pipeline and the 
other offshore at a terminal loading buoy.
SPDC JV has an ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain and 
replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines to reduce the number 
of operational spills.
[A] Unless otherwise stated, all activities reported for or as relating to The Shell Petroleum 
Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in this section should be understood as 
SPDC acting as the operator of the SPDC joint venture (SPDC JV). SPDC, as the corporate 
entity, owns 30% of the joint venture.
On March 13, 2025, Shell completed the sale of SPDC to Renaissance. 
By preserving the full range of SPDC's operating capabilities, the 
transaction has been designed to ensure that the company can 
continue to perform its role as operator and to meet its share of 
commitments within the joint venture, including those relating to 
health, safety, security and environment. 
SPDC JV - Nigeria: Spills caused by crude theft and sabotage
In 2024, about 81% of crude oil spill incidents of more than 100 
kilograms from SPDC JV facilities were caused by the illegal activities 
of third parties. In 2024, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 
100 kilograms caused by crude theft and sabotage was 2.0 thousand 
tonnes (84 incidents), compared with 1.4 thousand tonnes (139 
incidents) in 2023. The decrease in the number of incidents in 2024 
shows an increased effectiveness of anti-theft protection mechanisms. 
Prevention
In 2024, SPDC JV continued on-ground surveillance of its areas 
of operation, including its pipeline network, to mitigate third-party 
interference and ensure that spills are detected and responded
to as quickly as possible.
Regular surveillance flights and drones are used to inspect the most 
vulnerable segments of the pipeline network, monitor security and 
identify any new spills or illegal activity. SPDC JV continued to install and 
improve anti-theft protection mechanisms for key infrastructure, such as 
wellheads and manifolds. These include protective measures such as 
cages, anti-theft nuts and improved CCTV and networking capabilities. 
These measures continue to help deter theft and improve response.
SPDC JV continued to work with the government security agencies in 
2024 to maintain surveillance and address illegal activities of third 
parties, primarily along the SPDC JV pipelines and their operational areas.
Response and remediation
Regardless of the cause, SPDC JV cleans up and remediates areas 
affected by spills originating from its facilities. Clean-up activities 
include bio-remediation which stimulates micro-organisms that naturally 
break down and use carbon-rich oil, effectively removing it. Once 
clean-up and soil remediation operations are completed, the work is 
inspected and, if satisfactory, approved and certified by the Nigerian 
regulators. In the event of operational spills, SPDC JV also pays 
compensation to affected people and communities.
Road safety

[A] In line with industry practice, we distinguish three contract modes. Mode 1: Shell has 
control of the workplace or work activity; Mode 2: Shell and the contractor control their 
own workplace, but these workplaces can have a potential impact on each other which 
requires management of interfaces; Mode 3: Contractor or another external party controls 
the workplace and the contractor controls the work activity. In accordance with industry 
practice, we report on personal safety performance for Mode 1 and Mode 2. Mode 3 
contractors are non-reporting unless working on Shell premises.
[B] Motor vehicle incidents involving a fatality, lost time injury, vehicle rollover, medical 
treatment case or restricted work case.
In 2024, Shell employees and contractors drove around 424 million 
kilometres on work-related business. Commercial road transport accounts 
for most of the kilometres driven. There were 17 severe motor vehicle 
incidents. There were no road-transport-related fatalities in 2024.

Supplementary data for pollution, 
water, biodiversity and waste, 
including estimates for non-operated 
assets
This section provides data for pollution, water, biodiversity and 
resource use and circular economy according to the reporting 
boundaries specified by the European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ESRS), including estimated data for non-operated assets. 
In line with industry practice, Shell has historically reported 
sustainability data using an operational control boundary, whereby 
data are reported on a 100% basis for assets under operational 
control. This approach reflects the prevalence of joint operations in the 
oil and gas sector and the common industry practice of designating 
an operating partner to create and apply operating policies and 
standards. We have historically considered the operational control 
boundary to be the most appropriate way to report sustainability data, 
as it reflects performance we directly manage through the application 
of our operating standards. 
The ESRS specify different reporting boundaries per environmental 
topic. These boundaries differ from our historical reporting. For 
pollution and biodiversity, the ESRS specify a hybrid boundary that 
combines elements of operational control and financial control, which 
we refer to as the "ESRS boundary". For water and for resource use 
and circular economy, ESRS specifies a financial control boundary. See 
"General basis for preparation of Sustainability Statements (BP-1)" on 
page 342 for an explanation of the differences between these 
boundaries and how they are applied.
To report data against a financial control or ESRS boundary requires 
access to data from non-operated ventures. Shell has more than 50 
joint operations not under operational control that fall within the ESRS 
boundary, of which 85% operate outside the European Economic Area. 
These ventures are not subject to the EU Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD), nor are they contractually obliged under 
the operator agreement to provide the volume and granularity of data 
required by the ESRS.
Shell sample-tested data availability from non-operated ventures and 
observed gaps in availability, quality and completeness. We have 
therefore, in accordance with the ESRS, estimated the data for non-
operated ventures. See "General basis for preparation of Sustainability 
Statements (BP-1)" on page 342 for information about our efforts to 
gather data from non-operated ventures.
In the absence of actual data, information must be estimated, resulting 
in a high level of uncertainty. The preparation of estimates requires 
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the information reported. Actual results may differ from estimates. 
The circumstances and operating standards of non-operated ventures 
may vary from Shell-operated ventures, which may result in differences 
in which metrics are assessed as reportable and how they are 
measured. Areas of significant judgement are highlighted below. 
Estimation methodology for pollution, water and waste
The data presented in this section are based on a combination of 
actual data for operated assets and estimated data for joint operations 
not under Shell's operational control (non-operated ventures). 
We assessed different options for estimating data for non-operated 
ventures. These included the use of data on production volumes, Scope 
1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions as a proxy for pollution, water consumption and waste. We 
concluded that the use of Scope 1 emissions is an appropriate proxy for 
these metrics. 
Pollution
For pollution-related metrics, we calculated data for non-operated 
assets based on data from Shell-operated assets. To do so, we 
established a ratio between actual Scope 1 GHG emissions and the 
relevant pollution metrics for Shell-operated ventures. This factor was 
then applied to actual Scope 1 GHG emissions reported on the ESRS 
boundary, which contains both operated and non-operated ventures. 
This method allows us to derive estimated totals for pollution on the 
ESRS boundary. 
Water consumption and waste
For water consumption and waste, we calculated data for non-
operated assets based on data from Shell-operated assets. To do so, 
we established a ratio between actual Scope 1 GHG emissions and the 
relevant metrics for Shell-operated ventures. This factor was then 
applied to actual Scope 1 GHG emissions reported on a financial 
control boundary, which contains both operated and non-operated 
ventures. This method allows us to derive estimated totals for water 
consumption and waste on a financial control boundary. 
For water metrics, we assess that it is not possible to estimate stored 
water, as this metric is subject to variation depending on the individual 
asset circumstances.
Estimation uncertainties 
Estimation of this total environmental data for pollution, water and 
waste is subject to inherent uncertainty due to factors such as 
limitations in the availability of non-operated data and the high level 
assumptions applied in the selection and application of proxy 
indicators. These estimates should be interpreted with an understanding 
of these factors. 
Estimation methodology for non-operated sites impacting 
biodiversity sensitive areas
We provide an estimate of non-operated sites impacting biodiversity 
sensitive areas. Our ability to perform this exercise is constrained by 
lack of spatial data for the more than 50 assets not under Shell 
operational control that fall within the ESRS boundary.
Due to limited availability of information at a Group level about the 
spatial boundaries of non-operated assets as well as local impacts and 
dependencies, we selected a sample of assets for assessment, using 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions as a proxy for materiality. The assets in scope 
of this analysis represent more than 90% of the Scope 1 and 2 
emissions from joint operations not under Shell's operational control in 
2024. 
Using the S&P Global spatial layers, we established a representative 
geographic feature set for each asset. Features were identified from a 
combination of the following layers: Onshore and offshore blocks, 
onshore and offshore pipelines, floating production storage and 
offloading (FPSO) units, platforms, gas plants and refineries.
We applied the same definition of biodiversity sensitive areas as for the 
sites under operational control. These include UNESCO World 
Heritage Sites, the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, key 
biodiversity areas and other protected areas. The latter encompass 
Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance, UNESCO Man--
Biosphere Reserves, areas designated under regional agreements such 
as OSPAR and Emerald Network, as well as nationally designated 
areas reported as International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) Management Category I–IV.

---- Page 437 ----
Although well datasets were excluded due to the large number of 
identified features, licence blocks, where appropriate, were identified 
as a proxy.
The resulting analysis was imported to the Integrated Biodiversity 
Assessment Tool (IBAT), which incorporates the World Database of 
Protected Areas (WDPA) maintained by the UN Environment 
Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) 
and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA) 
maintained by BirdLife International. The IBAT Disclosure Report 
function was used to identify potential sites based on their overlap with 
key biodiversity areas and protected areas.
In the absence of actual footprint data, we applied a 1 kilometre buffer 
to the imported data to identify overlaps with key biodiversity areas 
and WDPA protected areas. Proximity to or overlap with a designated 
area does not necessarily mean the area is impacted by the activities. 
Estimates of sites impacting biodiversity sensitive areas are subject to 
inherent uncertainty due to factors such as limitations in the 
completeness or accuracy of the spatial datasets used for the analysis, 
and the possibility that datasets may exclude infrastructure that is part 
of the asset or include infrastructure that is not part of the asset. These 
estimates should be interpreted with an understanding of these factors.

strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)" on page 397 for 
information about our approach to assessing Shell-operated sites 
impacting biodiversity sensitive areas.

Independent Auditor's report related 
to the Sustainability Statements
INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT TO THE DIRECTORS 
OF SHELL PLC ON THE SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENTS
Ernst & Young LLP ('EY') was engaged by Shell plc ('the Company') to 
perform a limited assurance engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised), to report if the sustainability statements for the year ended 
31 December 2024,
 
including the information incorporated in the 
sustainability statements by reference (together hereafter referred to as 
the 'Sustainability Statements'), is in all material respects in accordance 
with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards ('ESRS') as 
adopted by the European Commission and is compliant with the 
reporting requirements provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 
2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation) (together the 'Criteria') as set out 
on pages 377-390 of Shell plc's Annual Report and Accounts.
Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Sustainability Statements is not, in all material respects: 
￮in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards 
('ESRS') as adopted by the European Commission;
￮ inclusive of all material sustainability-related impacts, risks and 
opportunities for Shell plc as identified by the double materiality 
assessment process carried out by the Company in compliance with 
the ESRS; and
￮ Compliant with the reporting requirements provided for in Article 8
of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation).
Basis for our conclusion
We conducted our engagement in accordance with International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance 
Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, as promulgated by the International Auditing and 
Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) and the terms of our engagement 
letter dated August 8, 2024 as agreed with Shell plc. 
In performing this engagement, we have applied International 
Standard on Quality Management ('ISQM') 1 Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other 
Assurance or Related Services engagements, which requires that we 
design, implement and operate a system of quality management 
including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 
We have maintained our independence and other ethical requirements 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales 
('ICAEW') Code of Ethics (which includes the requirements of the Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants ('IESBA')). We are the independent 
auditor of the Company and therefore we will also comply with the 
independence requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard 
as applied to listed public interest entities.
Emphasis of matter – The most significant uncertainties 
affecting the quantitative metrics and monetary amounts
The Sustainability Statements has been prepared in the context of new 
sustainability reporting standards, requiring entity specific and 
temporary interpretations and navigating inherent measurement or 
evaluation uncertainties.
We draw attention to the General basis for preparation of 
Sustainability Statements on page 342 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts that identifies the quantitative metrics and monetary amounts 
that are subject to a high level of measurement uncertainty and 
discloses information about the sources of measurement uncertainty 
and the assumptions, approximations and judgements the Company 
has made in measuring these in compliance with the ESRS. 
The comparability of sustainability information between entities and 
over time may be affected by the lack of historical sustainability 
information in accordance with the ESRS and by the absence of a 
uniform practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure this 
information. This allows for the application of different, but acceptable, 
measurement techniques, especially in the initial years.
Emphasis of matter – The double materiality
assessment process
The Sustainability Statements, including the disclosure of material 
impacts, risks and opportunities in accordance with the ESRS, is 
prepared with the double materiality assessment processes carried out 
by the Company as described on the pages 351-354 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The double materiality assessment process requires Shell plc to make 
key judgments and use thresholds and it is expected that this process 
will be refined over time. The double materiality assessment process 
uses quantitative and/or qualitative thresholds to determine which 
impacts, risks and opportunities are identified and addressed by Shell 
plc as material and to determine which sustainability matters are 
material for reporting purposes. Therefore, the sustainability statements 
may not include every impact, risk and opportunity or additional entity-
specific disclosure that each individual stakeholder (group) may 
consider important in its own particular assessment.
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of these matters.
Responsibilities of the Company for the Sustainability 
Statements
The directors of the Company are solely responsible for the preparation 
of the Sustainability Statements in accordance with the ESRS, including 
the double materiality assessment process carried out by Shell plc as 
the basis for the Sustainability Statements and the disclosure of the 
material impacts, risks and opportunities in accordance with the ESRS. 
As part of the responsibilities for preparation of the Sustainability 
Statements, the directors of Shell plc are responsible for compliance 
with the reporting requirements provided for in Article 8 of Regulation 
(EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation).
Shell plc is also responsible for selecting and applying additional
entity-specific disclosures to enable users to understand the company's 
sustainability-related impacts, risks or opportunities and for determining 
that these additional entity-specific disclosures are suitable in the 
circumstances and in accordance with the ESRS.
The directors of the Company are also responsible for designing and 
implementing internal controls, maintaining adequate records, making 
estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability 
Statements and other processes they determine are necessary, such 
that the Sustainability Statements is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Responsibilities of EY for the limited assurance 
engagement on the Sustainability Statements
It is our responsibility to:
￮plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance in 
respect of whether the Subject Matter has not been prepared in all 
material respects in accordance with the Criteria.
￮ form an independent conclusion on the presentation of the Subject 
Matter on the basis of the work performed and evidence obtained; 
and
￮ report our conclusion to the directors of the Company.
What EY has assured
Our limited assurance report only covers the Sustainability Statements, 
presented on pages 341-440 of the Annual Report and Accounts 
including the information incorporated by reference, on pages 
358-364 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Other than as detailed above, we did not perform assurance 
procedures on any other information included in the Annual Report and 
Accounts, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or conclusion 
on any such other information. 
Our approach
The objective of a limited assurance engagement is to perform such 
procedures so as to obtain information and explanations in order to 
provide us with sufficient appropriate evidence to express a negative 
conclusion on the Sustainability Statements. The nature, timing and 
extent of procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement 
is dependent on our judgement, including our assessment of the risk 
of material misstatement and is less in extent than for, a reasonable 
assurance engagement. Our procedures were only designed to obtain 
a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do 
not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a 
reasonable level of assurance.
Although we considered the effectiveness of management's internal 
controls when determining the nature, timing and extent of our 
procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide 
assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing 
controls or performing procedures relating to checking the aggregation 
or calculation of data within IT systems.
A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily 
of persons responsible for preparing the Sustainability Statements and 
related information and applying analytical and other appropriate 
procedures. 
Because a limited assurance engagement can cover a range of 
assurance, the detail of the procedures we have performed is included 
below, so that our conclusion can be understood in the context of the 
nature, timing and extent of the procedures we performed:
￮Made inquiries and an analysis of the external environment and 
obtained an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and 
issues, the characteristics of the Company, its activities and the value 
chain and its key intangible resources in order to assess the double 
materiality assessment process carried out by the Company as the 
basis for the Sustainability Statements and disclosure of all material 
sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities in accordance 
with the ESRS;
￮ Obtained through inquiries a general understanding of the internal 
control environment, the Company's processes for gathering and 
reporting entity-related and value chain information, and for 
identifying the Company's activities, determining eligible and aligned 
economic activities and preparing the disclosures provided for in 
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation), the 
information systems and the Company's risk assessment process 
relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Statements; 
￮ Assessed the double materiality assessment process carried out by 
the Company and identified and assessed areas of the Sustainability 
Statements, including the disclosures provided for in Article 8 of 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation), where 
misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements, 
whether due to fraud or error, are likely to arise ('selected 
disclosures');
￮ Designed and performed further assurance procedures aimed at 
addressing risks of material misstatements within the sustainability 
statements responsive to this risk analysis, including making inquiries 
of management;
￮ Considered whether the description of the double materiality 
assessment process in the Sustainability Statements made by 
management appears consistent with the process carried out by 
Shell plc;
￮ Performed analytical procedures on quantitative information in the 
Sustainability Statements, including consideration of data and 
trends;
￮ Assessed whether Shell plc's methods for developing estimates are 
appropriate and have been consistently applied for the selected 
disclosures. We considered data and trends, however our 
procedures did not include testing the data on which the estimates 
are based or separately developing our own estimates against which 
to evaluate management's estimates;
￮ Analysed, on a limited sample basis, relevant internal and external 
documentation available to Shell plc (including publicly available 
information or information from participants throughout its value 
chain) for selected disclosures;
￮ Read the other information in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
identify material inconsistencies, if any, with the Sustainability 
Statements;
￮ Considered how the Company identified economic activities eligible 
under the Taxonomy Regulation for each of the environmental 
objectives, reconciled selected key performance indicators for 
eligible activities with the accounts, considered whether these were 
calculated in accordance with the Taxonomy reference framework, 
and assessed how the Company identified where the eligible 
economic activities meet the cumulative conditions to qualify as 
aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation;
￮ Read the disclosures provided to address the reporting requirements 
of the Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation for consistency; and
￮ Considered the overall presentation, structure and qualitative 
characteristics of sustainability information (relevance and faithful 
representation: complete, neutral and accurate) reported in the 
Sustainability Statements, including the reporting requirements 
provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy 
Regulation).
We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary 
in the circumstances.

Inherent limitations
Non-financial information is subject to more inherent limitations than 
financial information, given the characteristics of the underlying subject 
matter. Because there is not yet a large body of established practice 
upon which to base measurement and evaluation techniques, the 
methods used for measuring or evaluating non-financial information, 
including the precision of different techniques, can differ, yet be equally 
acceptable. This may affect the comparability between entities, and 
over time.
Comparative information included in the sustainability statements has 
not been part of our limited assurance engagement. Consequently, 
we do not provide any assurance on the comparative information and 
thereto related disclosures in the sustainability statements for Shell Plc. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Our conclusion is based on historical information and the projection of 
any information or conclusions in the sustainability statements report to 
any future periods would be inappropriate.
In reporting forward-looking information in accordance with the ESRS, 
Shell plc is required to prepare the forward-looking information on the 
basis of disclosed assumptions about events that may occur in the 
future and possible future actions by Shell plc. Forward looking 
information relates to events and actions that have not yet occurred 
and may never occur. The actual outcome is likely to be different since 
anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected. We do not 
provide assurance on the achievability of forward-looking information.
Use of our report
This report is produced in accordance with the terms of our 
engagement letter dated August 8, 2024, solely for the purpose 
of reporting to the directors of Shell plc in connection with the 
Sustainability Statements for the period ended 31 December 2024. 
Those terms permit disclosure on Shell plc's website, solely for the 
purpose of Shell plc showing that it has obtained an independent 
assurance report in connection with the Sustainability Statements. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's 
directors as a body, for the procedures performed, for this report, or for 
the conclusions we have formed. This engagement is separate to, and 
distinct from, our appointment as the auditor to the Company.

Shareholder information
Shell plc (the Company) was incorporated in England and Wales on 
February 5, 2002, as a private company under the Companies Act 
1985, as amended. On October 27, 2004, the Company was re-
registered as a public company limited by shares and changed its 
name from Forthdeal Limited to Royal Dutch Shell plc. On January 21, 
2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to 
Shell plc. The Company is registered at Companies House, Cardiff, 
under company number 4366849. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
issued by the London Stock Exchange is 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70. 
The business address for the Directors and Senior Management is 
Shell Centre, London, SE1 7NA.
On December 31, 2021, the Company became tax resident in the 
United Kingdom. Its primary objective is to carry on the business of a 
holding company. It is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by 
another corporation or by any government and does not know of any 
arrangements that may result in a change of control of the Company.
Nature of trading market
On January 29, 2022, the Company established one single line of 
ordinary shares, each having a nominal value of €0.07. All shares are 
listed and able to trade at Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock 
Exchange. Furthermore, all shares are transferable between these two 
markets. This makes both these exchanges primary exchanges for the 
ordinary shares. 
Ordinary shares are traded in registered form. 
The Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange [A]. A depositary receipt is a certificate 
that evidences ADSs. Depositary receipts are issued, cancelled and 
exchanged at the office of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 383 Madison 
Avenue, New York, New York 10179, USA, as depositary (the 
Depositary), under Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement 
and Amendment No. 1 thereto (Deposit Agreement) between the 
Company, the Depositary and the holders of ADSs. Each ADS is 
equivalent to two ordinary shares of Shell plc deposited under the 
Deposit Agreement. All ordinary shares are capable of being 
deposited with the Depository in exchange for the corresponding 
amount of ADSs which may be traded at the New York Stock 
Exchange. This makes the New York Stock Exchange the primary 
exchange for the Company's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). 
More information relating to ADSs is given on page 443.
[A] At March 4, 2025, 569,992,987 ADSs were outstanding, representing 18.86% of the 
ordinary share capital, held by holders of record with an address in the USA. In addition 
to holders of ADSs, at March 4, 2025, 865,294 ordinary shares of €0.07 each were 
outstanding, representing 0.0143% of the ordinary share capital, held by 2951 holders 
of record registered with an address in the USA.

Significant shareholdings
The Company's ordinary shares have voting rights on all matters that 
are subject to shareholder approval, including the election of directors. 
The Company's major shareholders do not have different voting rights.
Notification of major shareholdings 
The Company did not receive any notifications pursuant to Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 5 during the year and up to 
March 4, 2025, (being a date not more than one month prior to 
the date of the Company's Notice of Annual General Meeting). 
Designation of the Netherlands as EU Home Member 
State for regulatory purposes
Following the exit of the UK from the EU and the end of the transition 
period, the Company announced that the EU Home Member State of 
the Company for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive would 
be the Netherlands as from January 1, 2021. As a consequence, the 
Company files Transparency Directive and Market Abuse Regulation-
related regulatory information with the Netherlands Authority for the 
Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, or AFM). Major 
shareholders are required to report substantial holdings in Shell 
to the AFM in accordance with applicable Dutch law, in addition
to their ongoing disclosure obligations under the DTR.
Method of holding shares or an interest in shares
There are several ways in which Shell plc registered shares or an 
interest in these shares can be held, including:
￮directly as registered shares either in uncertificated form or in 
certificated form in a shareholder's own name;
￮ indirectly through Euroclear Nederland (in respect of which the 
Dutch Securities Giro Act (Wet giraal effectenverkeer) is applicable);
￮ through the Shell Corporate Nominee Service;
￮ through another third-party nominee or intermediary company; and 
￮ as a direct or indirect holder of either ADS with the Depositary.
American Depositary Shares
The Depositary is holding the shares underlying the ADSs and to the 
extent it is doing so directly via its UK nominee enjoys the rights of 
a shareholder under the Articles. Holders of ADSs will not have 
shareholder rights. The rights of the holder of an ADS are specified in 
the Deposit Agreement with the Depositary and are summarised below.
The Depositary will receive all cash dividends and other cash 
distributions made on the deposited shares underlying the ADSs 
and, where possible and on a reasonable basis, will distribute such 
dividends and distributions to holders of ADSs. Rights to purchase 
additional shares will also be made available to the Depositary 
who may make such rights available to holders of ADSs. All other 
distributions made on the Company's shares will be distributed by the 
Depositary in any means that the Depositary thinks is equitable and 
practical. The Depositary may deduct its fees and expenses and the 
amount of any taxes owed from any payments to holders and it may 
sell a holder's deposited shares to pay any taxes owed. The Depositary 
is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or impractical to make 
a distribution available to holders of ADSs.
The Depositary will notify holders of ADSs of shareholders' meetings
of the Company and will arrange to deliver voting materials to such 
holders of ADSs if requested by the Company. Upon request by a 
holder, the Depositary will endeavour to appoint such holder as proxy 
in respect of such holder's deposited shares entitling such holder 
to attend and vote at shareholders' meetings. Holders of ADSs may 
also instruct the Depositary to vote their deposited securities and the 
Depositary will try, as far as practical and lawful, to vote deposited 
shares in accordance with such instructions. The Company cannot 
ensure that holders will receive voting materials or otherwise learn 
of an upcoming shareholders' meeting in time to ensure that holders 
can instruct the Depositary to vote their shares.
Upon payment of appropriate fees, expenses and taxes: 
(i) shareholders may deposit their shares with the Depositary and 
receive the corresponding class and amount of ADSs; and (ii) holders 
of ADSs may surrender their ADSs to the Depositary and have the 
corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account.
Further, subject to certain limitations, holders may, at any time, cancel 
ADSs and withdraw their underlying shares or have the corresponding 
class and amount of shares credited to their account.
Fees paid by holders of ADSs 
The Depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs 
directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for 
the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. 
The Depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors 
by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling 
a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The Depositary 
may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees 
for those services are paid. See page 444.
Payments by Depositary to the Company 
J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Depositary, has agreed to share 
with the Company portions of certain fees collected, less ADS 
programme expenses paid by the Depositary. For example, these 
expenses include the Depositary's annual programme fees, transfer 
agency fees, custody fees, legal expenses, postage and envelopes for 
mailing annual and interim financial reports, printing and distributing 
dividend cheques, electronic filing of US federal tax information, 
mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimile and 
telephone calls and the standard out-of-pocket maintenance 
costs for the ADSs. From January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, 
the Company received $641,716.13 from the Depositary.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
Equiniti Financial Services Limited, part of the Equiniti group of 
companies, operates a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) which 
enables Shell plc shareholders to elect to have their dividend payments 
used to purchase Shell plc ordinary shares. More information can be 
found at shareview.co.uk/info/drip or by contacting Equiniti, the 
Company's UK Registrar.
ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. also operate 
dividend reinvestment options. More information can be found by 
contacting the relevant provider.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting 
security holders 
Other than restrictions affecting those individuals, entities, government 
bodies, corporations, or activities that are targeted by European Union 
(EU) or UK sanctions for example, regarding Syria, Russia or North 
Korea, etc. and the general EU prohibition to transfer funds to and from 
for example, North Korea or Iran and the EU and UK financial 
restrictions affecting Russia or Belarus, we are not aware of any other 
legislative or other legal provision currently in force in the UK, the 
Netherlands, the EU or arising under the Articles restricting remittances 
to holders of the Company's ordinary shares who are non-residents 
of the UK, or affecting the import or export of capital.
Taxation 
General
The Company is incorporated in England and Wales. The Company 
changed tax residence from the Netherlands to the UK on December 
31, 2021.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Sales or transfers of the Company's ordinary shares within a clearance 
service (such as Euroclear Nederland) or of the Company's ADSs within 
the ADS depositary receipts system will not give rise to a stamp duty 
reserve tax (SDRT) liability and should not in practice require the 
payment of UK stamp duty.
The transfer of the Company's ordinary shares to a clearance service 
(such as Euroclear Nederland) or to an issuer of depositary shares 
(such as ADSs) will generally give rise to a UK stamp duty or SDRT 
liability at the rate of 1.5% of consideration given or, if none, of the 
value of the shares. A sale of the Company's ordinary shares that are 
not held within a clearance service (for example, settled through the 
UK's CREST system of paperless transfers) will generally be subject 
to UK stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount of the 
consideration, normally paid by the purchaser.
Capital gains tax 
For the purposes of UK capital gains tax, the market values [A] of the shares of the former public parent companies of the Shell Group at the 
relevant dates were:

Shell plc) became the single parent company of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and of The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c., now The Shell Transport and Trading Company 
Limited, and one share in Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was exchanged for two Royal Dutch Shell plc A shares and one share in The "Shell" Transport and Trading Company, p.l.c. was 
exchanged for 0.287333066 Royal Dutch Shell plc B shares.

Non-GAAP measures reconciliations
These non-GAAP measures, also known as alternative performance measures, are financial measures other than those defined in International 
Financial Reporting Standards, that Shell considers provide useful information. 
Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis
Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings), which is the earnings measure used by the Chief Executive 
Officer for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. On this basis, the purchase price of volumes 
sold during the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period after making allowance for the tax effect. CCS earnings 
therefore exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts. The current cost of supplies adjustment does not impact 
cash flow from operating activities in the "Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows". For "Reconciliation of CCS earnings to income for the period", 
please refer to Note 7 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".
Adjusted Earnings per share
Adjusted Earnings per share is calculated as Adjusted Earnings (see below) divided by the weighted average number of shares used as the basis 
for basic earnings per share (see Note 31 to the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). Adjusted Earnings per share were 3.76 in 2024 (2024 
Adjusted Earnings: $23,716 million; 2024 weighted average number of shares 6,299.6 million) and $4.20 in 2023 (2023 Adjusted Earnings 
$28,250 million; 2023 weighted average number of shares: 6,733.5 million).
Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), and Cash flow 
from operating activities
The "Adjusted Earnings" measure is presented on a CCS basis and aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance 
from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items 
adjusted for current cost of supplies. These items are in some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or collectively, hinder 
the comparative understanding of Shell's financial results from period to period.
The "Adjusted EBITDA" measure is presented on a CCS basis and is used by management to evaluate Shell's performance in the period and 
over time. We define "Adjusted EBITDA" as "Income/(loss) for the period" adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/
(credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs; and net interest expense. All items include the non-controlling 
interest component.

 Identified items
The objective of identified items is to remove material impacts 
on net income/loss arising from transactions which are generally 
uncontrollable and unusual (infrequent or non-recurring) in nature 
or giving rise to a mismatch of accounting and economic results, 
or certain transactions that are generally excluded from underlying 
results in the industry.
Identified items comprise: divestment gains and losses, impairments, 
redundancy and restructuring, provisions for onerous contracts, fair 
value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas contracts, 
and the impact of exchange rate movements on certain deferred tax 
balances, and other items. Identified items in the table below are 
presented on a net basis.

The identified items categories above may include after-tax impacts 
of identified items of joint ventures and associates which are fully 
reported within "Share of profit of joint ventures and associates" in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income, and fully reported as identified 
items included in Income/(loss) before taxation in the table above. 
Identified items related to subsidiaries are consolidated and reported 
across appropriate lines of the Consolidated Statement of Income. 
Only pre-tax identified items reported by subsidiaries are taken into 
account in the calculation of underlying operating expenses.
Provisions for onerous contracts: Provisions for onerous contracts 
that relate to businesses that Shell has exited or to redundant assets 
or assets that cannot be used.
Fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and certain gas 
contracts: In the ordinary course of business, Shell enters into contracts 
to supply or purchase oil and gas products, power and environmental 
products. Shell also enters into contracts for tolling, pipeline and 
storage capacity. Derivative contracts are entered into for mitigation of 
resulting economic exposures (generally price exposure) and these 
derivative contracts are carried at period-end market price (fair value), 
with movements in fair value recognised in income for the period. 
Supply and purchase contracts entered into for operational purposes, 
as well as contracts for tolling, pipeline and storage capacity, are, by 
contrast, recognised when the transaction occurs; furthermore, 
inventory is carried at historical cost or net realisable value, whichever 
is lower. As a consequence, accounting mismatches occur because: (a) 
the supply or purchase transaction is recognised in a different period, 
or (b) the inventory is measured on a different basis. In addition, certain 
contracts are, due to pricing or delivery conditions, deemed to contain 
embedded derivatives or written options and are also required to be 
carried at fair value even though they are entered into for operational 
purposes. The accounting impacts are reported as identified items. 
Impacts of exchange rate movements on tax balances represent the 
impact on tax balances of exchange rate movements arising on (a) the 
conversion to dollars of the local currency tax base of non-monetary 
assets and liabilities, as well as losses (this primarily impacts the 
Upstream and Integrated Gas segments) and (b) the conversion of 
dollar-denominated inter-segment loans to local currency, leading to 
taxable exchange rate gains or losses (this primarily impacts the 
Corporate segment).
Other identified items represent other credits or charges that based on 
Shell management's assessment hinder the comparative understanding 
of Shell's financial results from period to period.
Cash capital expenditure 
Cash capital expenditure monitors investing activities on a cash basis, 
excluding items such as lease additions which do not necessarily result 
in cash outflows in the period. The measure comprises the following 
lines from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Capital 
expenditure, Investments in joint ventures and associates and 
Investments in equity securities. The reconciliation of "Capital 
expenditure" to "Cash capital expenditure" is presented in Note 7 
to the "Consolidated Financial Statements".
Operating expenses and underlying operating expenses
Operating expenses is a measure of Shell's cost management 
performance, comprising the following items from the "Consolidated 
Statement of Income": production and manufacturing expenses; selling, 
distribution and administrative expenses; and research and 
development expenses.See Note 7 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements" for reconciliation of total operating expenses. 
Underlying operating expenses is a measure aimed at facilitating 
a comparative understanding of performance from period to period 
by removing the effects of identified items, which, either individually 
or collectively, can cause volatility, in some cases driven by 
external factors.

Total spend on goods and services
Total spend on goods and services represents the amounts paid to our 
suppliers globally and is comprised of both Capital Expenditure and 
Operating Expenditure. Employee costs are excluded from Operating 
costs as these do not relate to third-party spend. 
The total spend on goods and services is used to demonstrate the 
company's societal contribution towards suppliers, contractors and 
communities where Shell operates.
The calculation of Total spend on goods and services was changed in 
2023, with data published in previous years being limited to spend for 
Operated assets that has been contracted with the support of the 
Contracting and Procurement team, calculated on a cash 
payments basis.

Structural cost reduction
The structural cost reduction target is used for the purpose of 
demonstrating how management drives cost discipline across the entire 
organisation, simplifying our processes and portfolio, and streamlining 
the way we work.
Structural cost reduction describes the decrease in underlying 
operating expenses as a result of operational efficiencies, divestments, 
workforce reductions and other cost-saving measures that are expected 
to be sustainable compared with 2022 levels.

The total change between periods in underlying operating expenses 
will reflect both structural cost reductions and other changes in spend, 
including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange 
impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated 
with new operations. 
Estimates of cumulative annual structural cost reduction may be revised 
depending on whether cost reductions realised in prior periods are 
determined to be sustainable compared with 2022 levels. Structural 
cost reductions are stewarded internally to support management's 
oversight of spending over time. The 2025 target reflects annualised 
saving achieved by end-2025.

Capital Employed 
Effective from 2024, the definition of capital employed has been 
amended to reflect the deduction of cash and cash equivalents.
Management believes that the updated methodology better reflects 
Shell's approach to managing capital employed, including the 
management of cash and cash equivalents alongside total debt and 
equity as part of the financial framework. Comparative information 
has been revised to reflect the updated definition.

Return on average capital employed
Return on average capital employed ("ROACE") measures the 
efficiency of Shell's utilisation of the capital that it employs. Shell 
uses two ROACE measures: ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings plus
Non-controlling interest (NCI) basis and LTIP ROACE.
ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings plus NCI basis relies on earnings on 
an Adjusted Earnings plus NCI basis excluding identified items adjusted 
for after-tax interest expense and after-tax interest income and is 
considered to be comparable with Shell's IFRS peers, who tend to 
adjust for similar items when calculating ROACE. The measure refers 
to Capital employed which consists of Total equity, current debt, 
and non-current debt, reduced by cash and cash equivalents.
In addition, the numerator applied to ROACE on an Adjusted Earnings 
plus NCI basis has been amended to remove interest on cash and cash 
equivalents for consistency with the revised capital employed definition.
LTIP (Long-Term Incentive Plan vesting) ROACE is a performance 
measure that is used for Long-Term Incentive Plan performance ranking 
and is defined as net income for the period as a percentage of the 
average capital employed for the period. The Capital Employed that 
is applied is different to the ROACE on an Adjusted earnings plus 
NCI basis in that it is not adjusted for Cash and cash equivalents.
ROACE on a Net Income basis has been discontinued, as this measure 
is no longer routinely used by management in assessing the efficiency 
of capital employed.

performance in the utilisation of the capital that the company employs. 
The exclusion of the impact of price effects provides a more 
comparable reflection of the underlying business performance.
This new measure will be calculated in the same manner as ROACE on 
an Adjusted Earnings plus NCI basis, with the only difference being the 
price-normalisation of Adjusted Earnings.
Price-normalisation refers to the process of removing the impact 
of macroeconomic price movements, so as to determine a more 
comparable basis for calculating the ROACE year on year. Shell 
believes this is a more meaningful basis for investors to be able to 
assess the Company's performance over time.
The normalised Adjusted Earnings will be determined by price-
normalising the adjusted earnings using a price set as published in 
Quarterly Databook for Brent, Henry Hub on a real term 2024 basis 
(and related gas markers) and Refining and Chemicals Margin to a 
price set as communicated during Capital Market Day 2025.
Net debt, Net debt excluding lease liabilities and gearing
Net debt is defined as the sum of current and non-current debt, less 
cash and cash equivalents, adjusted for the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange and interest 
rate risk relating to debt, and associated collateral balances. 
Management considers this adjustment useful because it reduces the 
volatility of net debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and 
interest rates, and eliminates the potential impact of related collateral 
payments or receipts. Debt-related derivative financial instruments are 
a subset of the derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities 
presented on the balance sheet. Collateral balances are reported 
under "Trade and other receivables" or "Trade and other payables" 
as appropriate. See also Note 20 to the "Consolidated Financial 
Statements". 
Net debt excluding lease liabilities is calculated by subtracting lease 
liabilities from Net Debt. 
Lease Liabilities are frequently long-term operational necessities rather 
than discretionary financing choices. Management believes that using 
Net debt excluding lease liabilities alongside Net debt gives better 
insight to the financial position by reflecting debt directly tied to 
financing activities, and improving comparability against peers 
with different asset ownership strategies or following different 
accounting standards.
Gearing is a measure of Shell's capital structure and is defined as 
net debt as a percentage of total capital (net debt plus total equity).

Cash flow from operating activities excluding working 
capital movements 
Working capital movements are defined as the sum of the following 
items in the Statement of Cash Flows: (increase) or decrease in 
inventories, (increase) or decrease in current receivables, and 
increase or (decrease) in current payables.
Cash flow from operating activities excluding working capital 
movements is a measure used by Shell to analyse its operating 
cash generation over time excluding the timing effects of changes 
in inventories and operating receivables and payables from period 
to period.

provisions are recognised in 'Decommissioning and other provisions' instead of 'Increase/
(decrease) in current payables'. Comparatives for 2023 and 2022 have been reclassified 
accordingly to conform with current period presentation.
Shareholder distribution and Shareholder distribution 
as percentage of CFFO
Shareholder distribution is used to evaluate the level of cash 
distribution to shareholders. It is defined as the sum of Cash dividends 
paid to Shell plc shareholders and Repurchases of shares. Both are 
reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
Shareholder distribution as a percentage of CFFO is used to measure 
the company's progress on increasing returns to shareholders. This 
measure is calculated by dividing the Shareholder distribution 
by the annual CFFO as presented in the Consolidated Statement 
of Cash Flows.

Price-normalised free cash flow growth and Price-
normalised free cash flow growth per share
Price-normalised free cash flow growth (of 6% average growth over the 
2022-2030 period) and Price-normalised free cash flow growth per share 
(of 10% average per annum over the 2022 - 2025 period) are business 
targets introduced during Capital Markets Day (CMD23) in 2023 for the 
purposes of demonstrating progress in value creation towards achieving 
our strategy, reported on an annual basis. 
Price-normalisation refers to the process of removing the impact 
of macroeconomic price movements, so as to determine a more 
comparable basis for calculating the growth in free cash flow year 
on year. Shell believes this is a more meaningful basis for investors 
to be able to assess the Company's performance over time.
Price-normalised cash flow from operating activities (CFFO) is 
determined by normalising the actual cash flow for the period by 
applying the price set communicated during CMD23 of: Brent, Henry 
Hub and related gas markers on a real-term 2022 basis, based on 
Operating Plan 2022 long-term price guidance until 2030 and, 
historical average Refining Margin $4-$6 per tonne (nominal) and 
historical average Chemicals Margin $150-$250 per tonne (nominal). 
The Price-normalised CFFO is added to Cash flow from Investments to 
achieve the Price-normalised free cash flow.
The Price-normalised free cash flow growth is determined by comparing 
the Price-normalised free cash flow of the current year to the previous year.
The Price-normalised free cash flow growth per share is calculated by 
first dividing the Price-normalised free cash flow for the year by the 
number of shares outstanding at the end of the period (the number of 
shares excludes shares held in trust), then comparing the current year 
Price-normalised free cash flow growth per share to the previous year.

Calculation of the price-normalisation
For each of the price markers shown in the table below, a comparison 
is made between the average prices for the period (published on our 
website Shell.com) against the price set shown below, which is based 
on the prices published at CMD23.
The price sensitivities shown in the table following, indicate the 
estimated impact in CFFO for the change in each price marker. 
The price sensitivities are applied to the price variance of each 
price marker to determine the impact on CFFO.
No price adjustments are made for Marketing and Renewables 
and Energy Solutions.

Normalised free cash flow growth per share
Normalised free cash flow growth per share is a new business target 
introduced during Capital Markets Day in 2025 for purposes of 
demonstrating progress in value creation towards achieving our strategy, 
reported on an annual basis. 
As from 2025 this new measure will replace the previous measures of 
Price-normalised free cash flow growth and Price-normalised free cash 
flow growth per share and will apply Organic free cash flow as the 
basis instead of Free cash flow, and also exclude the volatility of 
working capital and derivatives.
Price-normalised free cash flow will be determined by price-normalising 
the organic free cash flow using a price set as published in the 
Quarterly Databook for Brent, Henry Hub on a real term 2024 basis 
(and related gas markers) and Refining and Chemicals Margin to a 
price set as communicated during Capital Market Day 2025. This Price-
normalised organic free cash flow is then adjusted for the impact of 
working capital and derivatives.
Price-normalisation refers to the process of removing the impact 
of macroeconomic price movements, so as to determine a more 
comparable basis for calculating the growth in organic free cash flow 
year on year. Shell believes this is a more meaningful basis for investors 
to be able to assess the Company's performance over time.
The Normalised free cash flow per share is calculated by dividing the 
Normalised free cash flow (see above) by the number of shares 
outstanding at the end of the period (the number of shares excludes 
shares held in trust). 
The Normalised free cash flow growth per share is determined by 
comparing the Normalised free cash flow per share of the current year 
to the previous year. 
Taxes paid 
Taxes paid represents the taxes paid to governments and comprises 
Corporate income tax and government royalties.
This measure differs to prior years reporting in that taxes of excise 
duties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and products that are 
collected on behalf of the governments are no longer included. The 
removal of taxes collected which are not directly sourced from our 
systems is in line with our strategic simplification approach.

About this Report
The Shell plc Annual Report (this "Report") serves as the Annual Report 
and Accounts in accordance with UK requirements for the year ended 
December 31, 2024, for Shell plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries 
(collectively referred to as "Shell"). This Report presents the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Shell (pages 241-312) and the Parent Company 
Financial Statements of Shell (pages 333-339). Except for these Financial 
Statements, the numbers presented throughout this Report may not sum 
precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect 
the absolute figures due to rounding.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell plc and its subsidiaries 
contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with 
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements 
of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the "Act"), and therefore in accordance 
with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As applied to Shell, 
there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. IFRS as 
defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations 
Committee. Financial reporting terms used in this Report are in 
accordance with IFRS. 
This Report contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as 
cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a 
reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most 
comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information 
needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable 
GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which 
are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates 
and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the 
required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is 
extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable 
effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot 
be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are 
calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies 
applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. 
The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments 
are separate legal entities. In this report "Shell", "Shell Group" and 
"Group" are sometimes used for convenience to reference Shell plc and its 
subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words "we", "us" and "our" are also 
used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who 
work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is 
served by identifying the particular entity or entities. "Subsidiaries", "Shell 
subsidiaries" and "Shell companies" as used in this report refer to entities 
over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The terms 
"joint venture", "joint operations", "joint arrangements", and "associates" 
may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has 
a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term 
"Shell interest" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or 
indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated 
joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. 
As used in this Report, "Accountable" is intended to mean: required or 
expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not 
necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually 
carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the 
implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as 
required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies 
that the framework is operating effectively. "Responsible" is intended to 
mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell 
company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational 
performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, 
Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, 
and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the 
operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies 
and policies.
Shell's "net carbon intensity" referred to in this Report includes Shell's 
carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our 
suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production, 
and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the 
energy products we sell. Shell's NCI also includes the emissions 
associated with the production and use of energy products produced 
by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own 
emissions. The use of the terms Shell's "net carbon intensity" or NCI is for 
convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those 
of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.
Shell's operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three year period 
and 10-year period, respectively, and are updated every year. They 
reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably 
expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly, the outlook 
reflects our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next 10 years. 
However, Shell's operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-
zero emissions target, as this target is outside our planning period. Such 
future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our 
portfolio, efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and 
storage and carbon credits. In the future, as society moves towards net-
zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans and outlooks to reflect 
this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, 
there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. 
Except where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are 
in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling 
interest. However, the term "Shell share" is used for convenience to refer 
to the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold 
through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary's 
production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint 
operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 
100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, 
however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell's entitlement. In 
all cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share. 
Except where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in 
US dollars. As used herein all references to "dollars" or "$" are to the 
US currency.
