About 
This Report
1CAPITAL A BERHAD ANNUAL REPORT 2023
From the start, we have considered Asean our home ground, 
building sky bridges to connect not only major destinations 
but also second and third-tier cities that had no international 
connections before. We chose to do so because we realise 
the potential of tourism to stimulate economic growth. 
Today, as we grow our ecosystem into logistics, aviation 
services, a travel app and branding 
platform, we continue to champion 
Asean values, diversity and potential 
through partnerships, innovation 
and initiatives that promote regional 
unity, economic growth and cultural 
exchange. We seek to connect 
everyone in Asean to each other while 
bringing Asean to the world and the 
world to Asean.

Our Operating Environment
We monitor our operating 
environment because it necessarily 
has an impact on our operations 
and performance. In the following 
pages, we describe some of the key 
macro trends that contributed, either 
positively or negatively, to our five 
business verticals and all our lines of 
business (LOBs) in 2023.
Slowdown in the Economy 
The global economy continued on its path of deceleration 
from 3.2% in 2022 to an estimated 3.0% in 2023. This has 
been due to lingering effects of the pandemic, geopolitical 
tensions – particularly between Russia and Ukraine and in 
the Gaza Strip – as well as volatile commodity prices and 
tightening monetary policies to curb inflation. 
Nevertheless, growth in Asean exceeded the global average, 
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicting gross 
domestic product (GDP) expansion of 4.3% in 2023, which 
is to pick up further to 4.7% in 2024. Though on the higher 
end of the global spectrum, Asean’s growth in 2023 is 
lower than earlier predicted mainly because of the trade 
slowdown which impacted export-oriented markets such 
as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Growth remained stable 
in Singapore, at about 1.0%, due to strong services and 
construction sectors; and was the highest in the Philippines 
and Indonesia, at 5.7% and 5.0% respectively, driven by 
domestic demand. For the year 2024, ADB expects Asean’s 
GDP growth to pick up to 4.7%.
Volatile Jet Fuel Prices
Changes in supply and demand dynamics for oil resulted 
in volatilities in both the Brent crude oil index as well as jet 
fuel prices which move in tandem with it. Factors impacting 
demand included the ban by Europe on Russian petroleum 
products, slow economic recovery in China earlier in the 
year, global inflation and central bank interest rate rises. 
On the supply side, fluctuations were caused by conflicts 
in Ukraine and the Middle East; OPEC+ oil production cuts; 
and record-high US oil production. The Brent crude oil 
index swung from close to USD70 per barrel to a high of 
USD93/ barrel in September, ending the year at USD77/
barrel, roughly 6% lower than at the start of 2023.1
Chart 1: Brent crude oil historical and forecast price, USD/bbl
Source: S&P Capital IQ: US Energy Information Administration; IATA 
Sustainability and Economics
For the year as a whole, the Brent index averaged USD83/
barrel, 18% lower than USD101/barrel in 2022. Moving forward, 
steady supply from countries outside Opec+ and an uncertain 
economic outlook are expected to keep prices at USD70-
USD80/barrel in the short to mid-term, with the jet crack 
spread expected to narrow from 36% in 2023 to 30% in 2024.2
Pick Up in Air Travel
Air travel continued to gain momentum in 2023, especially in 
the Asia-Pacific region where pandemic-related restrictions 
were rescinded later than in more developed markets, i.e. the 
US and Europe. Globally, the industry grew 36.9% year on year 
(YoY) with revenue passenger-kilometre (RPK) reaching 94.1% 
of 2019 levels, significantly higher than 68.7% in 2022. The 
greatest YoY growth in RPK as well as capacity as measured 
by available seat kilometre (ASK) was seen in Asia-Pacific, at 
96.3% and 75.1% respectively. However, RPK and ASK in the 
region are still 14.0% and 12.3% short of pre-pandemic levels 
respectively, indicating potential for further growth in 2024 
and beyond.
Cargo Demand: From Low to Grow
Globally, the volume of cargo transported by air, measured 
by cargo tonne kilometre (CTK), contracted by 1.9% while 
capacity, measured by available CTK (ACTK), increased 
by 11.3%. This led to a 5.9 percentage point decrease in the 
cargo load factor which, together with relatively high jet fuel 
price throughout the year, saw cargo yields drop by 34% 
from historic highs in 2022. Nevertheless, they exceeded pre-
pandemic levels by 42%.

Capacity growth in the Asia-Pacific region surpassed the global 
average, at 28.5% YoY, and even exceeded pre-pandemic 
capacity by 6.7%.3 At the same time, there was a marked lag in 
demand which declined by 2.8% YoY. Optimistically, a pick-up 
was seen in the last quarter, boosted primarily by e-commerce. 
International freight tonne kilometres (FTK) increased by 8.2% 
YoY in 4Q 2023, peaking at 13.2% in December.4 The accelerating 
increase in demand from the third quarter indicates a positive 
trend in 2024.

Highlights of the four key e-economy areas 
High interest rates notwithstanding, people are making the most of the ability to 
apply for loans easily and conveniently online, while also gravitating towards buy-
now-pay-later (BNPL) services. Within the digital financial services space, lending is 
the highest revenue earner, growing at a CAGR of 46% to USD19 billion from 2019 
to 2023. Meanwhile, the digital insurance and wealth sectors hold much potential 
for growth as they are still in nascent stages. In insurance, AI-driven premium 
calculations help to optimise prices for consumers, making them more attractive 
as well as accessible and convenient to purchase. In the wealth space, more people 
from all segments are leveraging the convenience of self-service investment online.

Expanding Digital Economy
The digital economy continues to grow at a phenomenal 
rate in Asean, driven by increasing internet connectivity and 
subscription as well as relatively robust GDP growth. A key 
development in recent years has been a shift from attracting 
as many users as possible to monetisation as digital businesses 
seek to achieve profit targets. According to a Google, Temasek 
and Bain&Co report based on data collated from August to 
September 2023, the digital economy was expected to deliver 
USD100 billion in revenue in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 27% 
since 2021. At the same time, gross merchandise value (GMV) 
was expected to grow at 11% to USD218 billion in 2023, and to 
accelerate with a CAGR of 16% to hit USD295 billion by 2025.
e-Commerce: Revenue has outstripped 
GMV as players increase their take rates and 
venture into adjacent revenue streams such 
as logistics and advertising. Nevertheless, the 
influx of new players is keeping GMV high, 
and the grocery sector shows much potential 
for further growth given investments 
into overcoming logistics and economic 
challenges.
Transport: Revenue increased by a CAGR of 
47% YOY while GMV grew at 18% with demand 
exceeding pre-pandemic levels in most cities. 
Increasing productivity and accessibility, 
companies are adopting AI-powered routing 
and surge pricing as well as proprietary 
mapping. In the longer term, e-vehicles and 
autonomous driving will fuel further growth 
of this sector.
Travel: International travel is rapidly 
growing and surpassed domestic travel 
in 2023, with further expansion expected 
as more capacity opens up. At current 
rates, tourism and travel should exceed  
pre-pandemic levels in 2024.
Food delivery: While eating out is back in 
demand, consumers across Asean are still 
placing food orders, with revenue from 
this sector increasing by 60% to USD800 
million between 2022 and 2023. Adjacent 
revenue streams have emerged such as 
dine-in bookings, loyalty and subscription 
programmes, as well as advertising.

Key Risks and Mitigation
All businesses face risks arising from potential uncertainty around strategy, operations, compliance, environment and safety. 
Factors that could affect Capital A’s business include, but are not limited to, changes in economic conditions, government 
regulations, and competitive pressures within the industry, geopolitical tensions, changes in interest rates, etc.
The Board and Management of Capital A are committed to maintaining an appropriate risk culture premised on the drive towards 
effective management of risks at the Group. Some of the key risks experienced by Capital A are listed below, along with a residual 
risk rating (1-5 stars) according to their probability of occurrence and potential severity after adequate controls have been put 
in place (with 5 stars being the most severe).
STRATEGIC
OPERATIONAL
RISK MITIGATION
Climate 
Change
In the Group’s effort towards Net Zero by 
2050 there are challenges with increasing 
cost of compliance with new regulations 
and standards, operational disruptions 
due to adverse climate events as well as 
managing changing customer expectations 
and perception towards sustainability.
The Group has put together a Sustainability framework with strategic 
drivers to reduce our carbon footprint, minimise waste and innovate to 
raise the bar.
On the aviation front, the Group plans to step up green operating 
procedures, introducing SAF into the fuel mix and purchasing carbon 
offsets to achieve Net Zero by 2050.
Residual Risk Rating
Geopolitical 
Uncertainty
Political instability, market downturns, 
natural disasters, health epidemics and any 
other event outside of the Group’s control 
in geographical areas where the Group 
operates could affect business operations.
The Group mitigates this risk by constantly monitoring information relating 
to geographical areas with potential impact to its business operations. 
This pertinent information is used to reduce that impact by adjusting the 
asset allocations, capacity management and promotions.
The Group has also established Crisis Management Teams that will respond 
and reduce the impact of a crisis to its business operations.
Residual Risk Rating
Slow 
Business 
Growth
Intense competition in the marketplace 
arising from the entry of new players, 
expansion of competitors’ networks and 
price wars.
The different business entities within the Group have embarked on their 
respective business plans such as:
• Dynamic pricing, expanding capacity in high-yield routes and 
enhancing product offerings f
or aviation business;
• Hangar expansion in KLIA to bolster MRO capacity;
• Onboarding of third-party airlines and corporate clients f
or Santan;
• Strengthening of network and capacity for logistics business; and
• Enhancing features and offerings and broadening the inv
entory for the 
digital travel and lifestyle business.
Residual Risk Rating
RISK MITIGATION
Residual Risk Rating
System 
Outages
Outages of mission critical systems which 
are required for the continuity of operations.
The Group mitigates this risk by developing, implementing and testing 
specific backup and failover systems to reduce system outages.
The Group has also put in place alternative sites that exist in different 
geographical locations in the event these mission critical systems fail 
at any one location. A Business Continuity Plan with the relevant Crisis 
Management Plan has also been put in place.
Supply 
Chain 
Disruption
Supply chain risk resulting from the post 
pandemic economic downturn has many 
companies facing challenges in liquidity, 
manpower shortage and disruption in 
supply of raw materials.
Forward planning by increasing stock supply to cushion the stock supply 
lead time from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and working 
closely with vendors are some of the mitigation plans implemented by 
the Group.
Residual Risk Rating
Residual Risk Rating
Threat to 
Information 
Security
These arise from cyber attacks, malware, 
hackers resulting from the growing use 
of connected devices and systems. These 
threats can cause significant damage and 
losses to the Group.
The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining a strong cybersecurity 
posture by enhancing system configuration security. The Group adopts 
a robust information security system that revolves around the ISO/IEC 
27001 process and methodology to secure the information systems. 
Regular security assessments, penetration tests and source code reviews 
are performed on the systems to ensure cyber resilience.
Safety 
Threats
As the airline operations normalise post 
pandemic, the rapid growth in number of 
flights directly increases AirAsia’s exposure 
to operational hazards.

Post 
Pandemic 
Cash Flow
Management
Funding has been identified as a significant 
challenge during the pandemic for the 
Group. Though revenue generation saw an 
upward trend in both the aviation and non-
aviation businesses in 2023 as a result of 
normalisation of demand, there was also a 
significant reactivation cost involved.
The Group mitigates this risk by consolidating and simplifying its 
operations as well as diversifying and expanding new businesses to 
increase revenue source. The Group has also formulated regularisation 
plans which include restructuring of outstanding credit, sale & lease backs, 
negotiating concessions with vendors, etc.
Securing funds for non-aviation businesses (logistics, digital travel and 
lifestyle, MRO, etc), establishing strategic collaborations and creating 
commercial synergy within the ecosystem are amongst other measures 
initiated to improve cash flow.
Residual Risk Rating
Non-
Compliance 
with 
Regulatory
Requirements
Non-Compliance or breach of local 
laws, regulations, industry guidelines, or 
consumer authority requirements of multiple 
jurisdictions could lead to operational 
disruptions.
The Group has a Compliance function that has developed a master 
compliance repository to monitor compliance requirements. This risk 
is further addressed by maintaining high levels of engagement with 
regulators of each jurisdiction so that all regulatory requirements are 
adhered to consistently. The Group regularly monitors the landscape for 
new regulations or amendments that affect the Group.
Foreign 
Currency 
Fluctuations
Unexpected currency fluctuations could 
have a significant impact on the cost of 
financing and business operations. This 
holds particularly true of the exchange rate 
with the US Dollar.
The Group mitigates this risk by actively monitoring and managing its 
exposure to foreign currency volatility through natural hedging strategies. 
Group Treasury has a team that closely monitors these fluctuations.
Residual Risk Rating
Violation 
of Data 
Privacy
Violation of data privacy laws and regulations 
that could cause potential litigation and loss 
of customer confidence due to data breach.
The Group has a dedicated information security team that focuses 
on detecting, containing and remediating cyber threats. Robust IT 
infrastructure with adequate legal measures and regular awareness 
creation among employees to ensure data protection. Security 
assessments, penetration tests and source code reviews are also 
performed to ensure cyber resilience.

Chairman & Group CEO’s Statement
Performance Review
Yet… we made it. What’s more, unlike many airlines across East Asia, 
Europe and Australia, we survived with zero state support except for 
one RM300 million loan (USD63 million) from a development bank in 
Sabah. While getting the airlines off the ground, the team also worked 
extremely hard on building all our non-AirAsia businesses, laying solid 
foundations for future growth. Thanks to everyone’s commitment, we 
are today a low-cost, high-quality holistic aviation and travel services 
group made up of value-creating companies in aviation (AirAsia 
Group), aviation services (Capital A Aviation Services), logistics 
(Teleport) and branding/intellectual property (Capital A International) 
with our own travel platform (MOVE Digital, formerly airasia Digital) 
and venture capital arm (RedBeat Capital). 
As highlighted in the theme of this report, our focus is Asean. All our 
businesses are geared towards stimulating greater integration and 
economic growth in this region, which we have always considered 
our home. As we drive value for communities in Asean we are also 
laser-focused on realising the true value of all our companies for 
our shareholders. It is to this end that we are disposing of our airline 
business to AirAsia Group.
This disposal of Capital A’s aviation business is a deliberate and deeply 
considered move. It is not a response to COVID-19, but an effort that 
started in 2018. It came on the back of investors’ strong interest for 
a pure-play aviation company, and the vision of bringing together 
short-haul and long-haul airlines for the creation of the first low-cost 
carrier with a global network, akin to the successful models of Middle 
Eastern airlines, but with a unique anchor in the Asean region. This 
would set us apart as trailblazers in the aviation industry, something 
that is deeply ingrained in our corporate DNA.
The ultimate aim is for both airlines to have a converged fleet strategy 
operating on a single narrowbody family; AirAsia will upscale our 
Airbus A320 aircraft to the Airbus A321 and A321LR (Long Range) 
while AirAsia X downscales its widebody A330 to the narrowbody 
A321XLR (Extra Long Range). With the A321LR and A321XLR, our 
flight range would extend to between seven and 10 hours, effectively 
enabling us to connect to any destination anywhere in the world with 
just one stop. The choice of the A321 is based on various compelling 
factors. Most significantly, the aircraft have better fuel efficiency and 
larger capacity than the existing A320 which would result in lower 
cost per seat for every trip. They will also allow us to carry more 
guests to congested airports in the short-haul network, while opening 
up many more possibilities in the medium-haul segment as we will be 
able to fly to secondary and tertiary cities more efficiently. Given the 
weight advantage of the A321 over A330 aircraft, we can land them in 
more airports; plus we only need to fill 240 seats instead of 377 seats 
in the bigger A330 model. In addition, the A321 requires a shorter 
turnaround time than the A330, allowing for greater utilisation. The 
financial benefits seal the deal; by sticking to the same family, we save 
on the cost of maintenance and spare parts, as well as pilot training. 
Dear Shareholders
As paradoxical as it may seem, the year 2023 – with all its challenges – stands out as the year 
we are most proud of since the start of AirAsia and, now, Capital A. While much of the world 
carried on with a semblance of normalcy, for airlines with a focus on Asia, it marked a pivotal 
year in which international borders finally fully re-opened, catapulting us into the colossal task 
of building up our aviation businesses once again. In all sincerity, the endeavour proved to be 
much more daunting than when we started from scratch 22 years ago. Just reviving a single 
aircraft demands 40 worker hours; compound this by a factor of 41, which is the number of 
aircraft we eventually brought out of hibernation. What’s more, aircraft maintenance facilities 
in the region were severely restricted with high demand and supply chain bottlenecks 
everywhere. Beyond mere mechanical revival, we also had to bring in people, re-establish 
routes and jostle for limited airport slots amid a burgeoning and competitive landscape.  
Aviation
To capitalise on the strong rebound in international travel, we focused 
on reactivating our fleet – bringing back into service as many aircraft as 
possible, as quickly as possible. As mentioned above, it was an onerous 
task; nevertheless, we achieved significant success. MRO restrictions 
and other challenges aside, we brought 41 aircraft out of storage to 
end the year with 167 aircraft back in operations, with just 36 more 
to go. Although our seat capacity was only 74% of that pre-COVID, 
we flew 77% of our pre-COVID guest volume, achieving a higher load 
factor of 88% compared to 85% pre-COVID. We also worked intently 
on the groundwork for our latest AOC, AirAsia Cambodia, which will 
become operational by Q2 2024. 
Over the years, we have been fine-tuning the use of big data and data 
analysis to enhance our ancillary income. This year, along with the pick-
up in travel, we reaped the tangible benefits of personalised marketing 
and optimised pricing, with checked-in baggage, seats and inflight 
products enjoying robust take-up rates resulting in a substantial boost 
to revenue. In 2023, we recorded our highest ever ancillary income 
of RM2.4 billion with ancillary per pax at RM48, approaching our 
long-held goal of RM50. 
We have also completed the restructuring of contracts with Airbus, 
GE and lessors encompassing substantial sums in the billions, placing 
us closer to a regularisation plan that aligns with the expectations and 
needs of our stakeholders. On the topic of regularisation, the Aviation 
business bore the brunt of COVID-19, calling for the tough decision 
of having to let go a number of our valued Allstars. From the outset, 
we had promised to bring them back when circumstances improved. 
On 16 August 2023, we celebrated accomplishing this mission, which 
marked a meaningful milestone for our company and our dedicated 
team members.

Capital A Aviation Services
This business segment comprises all our aviation support service 
companies, namely MRO service provider Asia Digital Engineering 
(ADE), food services company Santan, Capital A Consultancy, and the 
newly-formed shared service centre DARTS. 
In 2023, ADE completed its 100th C-check, a remarkable milestone 
for an MRO only in its second year of operation. Further accelerating 
its growth, ADE secured USD100 million in funding from OCP Asia 
which is being used to add 14 lines to its current seven. Once these 
are completed in Q3 2024, ADE’s basic maintenance capacity will 
be significantly enhanced, enabling the team to grow its third-party 
client base. Meanwhile, its newly established digital marketplace 
AEROTRADE is now a thriving platform serving the needs of more 
than 150 airlines, MROs, distributors, OEMs, agents and stockists 
worldwide. ADE’s second groundbreaking digital solution, ELEVADE 
FLEET, is revolutionising aircraft maintenance with predictive and 
preventative capabilities.

Chairman & Group CEO’s Statement (cont’d)
Teleport
Teleport has undergone several business model iterations since 
its inception as a general sales agent (GSA). First, it consolidated 
the belly space of all AirAsia passenger aircraft across six AOCs 
to transport cargo. When the pandemic struck, it swiftly adapted, 
converting passenger aircraft into cargo carriers and establishing 
interlining partnerships with other airlines to boost capacity. Today, it 
is an integrated logistics solutions provider, operating a multi-modal, 
first- to last- mile network infrastructure -- its mid-mile comprises 
the largest air logistics network in Southeast Asia. Its air network 
combines a hybrid model of AirAsia’s belly space and over 30 partner 
airlines, as well as three new freighters, inducted in 2023. With 
expanded capacity, its total tonnage increased 88% YoY to nearly 
200,000 tonnes while parcel delivery surged by 275%, hitting close 
to 30 million parcels, leading Teleport to cement its position as the 
leading air logistics provider in Southeast Asia.
Santan has bounced back in tandem with AirAsia Aviation’s recovery, 
selling more than 19 million units of inflight meals, beverages, 
merchandise and duty-free, an increase of 114% year on year (YoY).  
It also expects to add third-party clients soon. We are especially 
optimistic about its ambient food technology which will significantly 
reduce wastage while opening up more revenue possibilities. Other 
than food, Santan is growing our inflight duty-free offerings with more 
Malaysian and eventually Asean brands, in line with our Asean-centric 
focus. 
Capital A Consultancy continues to provide advisory to a new low-
cost airline being set up in Bangladesh while marketing its services 
far and wide. DARTS was set up towards the end of 2023; however, it 
is not entirely new. It carries on the work of AirAsia SEA but now as 
a profit-making business in its own right. We believe that converting 
it into a business will help to increase efficiencies and reinforce our 
culture of minimising costs as far as practicable.
GTR is also experiencing significant growth along with increased 
flight and cargo traffic. Of note, it is ensuring this growth is green, 
introducing electric vehicles in klia2 for towing baggage and cargo. 
We are heartened to see small yet steady steps by our businesses that 
support the Group’s overall mission to reduce our emissions.
MOVE Digital
airasia digital rebranded to MOVE Digital and airasia Superapp to 
AirAsia MOVE to better reflect our commitment to moving people, 
funds and innovation forward within the travel space. During the 
pandemic, when air travel was curtailed and demand for delivery 
skyrocketed, we seized the opportunity to diversify into various online 
products and services, including even fresh fruit and seafood. With 
travel recovery, we are now refocused on evolving into a leading values-
driven online travel agency (OTA) in Asean underpinned by AirAsia’s 
vast network in the region. The results are evident, with significant 
growth in non-AirAsia flight and other bookings. As always, we aspire 
to be more than just another OTA; we want travellers to see AirAsia 
MOVE as an all-in-one travel platform where they can even research 
and plan the perfect holiday. Central to this vision is our Community 
where travellers can connect, share stories, and exchange tips for the 
best travel experiences.

Chairman & Group CEO’s Statement (cont’d)
Performance Review (cont’d)
Financial Performance
Financially, it has been a rewarding year, indicating we are on a firm path to full 
recovery. The Group’s revenue increased by 128% YoY to RM14.7 billion, and even 
surpassed our 2019 revenue by RM2.8 billion despite operating at only 79% of the 
number of aircraft flown in 2019. We also recorded a 39x increase in earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of RM1.9 billion.
The Aviation business contributed to RM13.7 billion of our revenue, or 91% of the total. 
This represents a 2.3x increase from RM6.4 billion in 2022 and, more hearteningly, a 
20.3% increase from revenue in 2019. Our strong performance was supported by a 
26% increase in average fares as well as 103% growth in the total number of guests 
carried. As mentioned earlier, ancillary income of RM2.4 billion was also significant. 
In addition, Aviation recorded RM1.5 billion in EBITDA (pre-elimination), marking 
285% growth YoY. The 15% drop in fuel price was a contributing factor, and helped 
to cushion a more than doubling of maintenance costs in line with the reactivation 
of aircraft.
ADE’s segmental revenue grew to RM574 million in 2023, doubling from the previous 
year. This growth was mirrored by a robust 136% YoY increase in EBITDA. Santan, 
meanwhile, celebrated an earnings rebound, recording a positive EBITDA of RM23 
million following a loss in 2022, fueled by 281% YoY surge in revenue.
Teleport saw its revenue increase by 56% YoY to RM731 million while posting an 
EBITDA of RM18 million, a significant improvement from making a loss in 2022. Its 
total capacity grew by 69% while tonnage increased by 88%, seeing its utilisation rate 
improve by two percentage points to 14%.
MOVE Digital recorded a 40% increase in revenue to RM379 million, of which AirAsia 
MOVE achieved a 71% increase in revenue driven by a surge in flights and hotels 
bookings - more than doubling compared to the previous year – while BigPay saw its 
segmental revenue increase by 42% YoY and its EBITDA loss narrowed by 44%.
Rebooting Our Culture
Having diversified rapidly into new business verticals 
over the last few years while managing to survive the 
pandemic, we have inevitably experienced the growing 
pains of expansion and restructuring. But we are 
determined to go back to our roots, reviving the unique 
culture that underlines AirAsia’s success, allowing us to 
get to where we are today. To bring back that distinctive 
entrepreneurial, dare to dream, can-do culture across 
the entire Group, we refreshed our eight core values at 
the start of 2024. They are the following: All for one, 
one for all; Dare to dream; Make a difference; Celebrate 
all individuals; Keep it simple; Be transparent; Have 
empathy and respect; and Safety is #1. Our people are 
our biggest asset and we will do all it takes to create the 
right environment that motivates them and encourages 
each one to realise his and her true potential. 
We have also always believed that happy Allstars make 
happy customers, which is another area we are focusing 
on today. It’s both amazing and humbling that we have 
won the World’s Best Low-Cost Airline award 14 years 
in a row. Yet, we know we can do better. As a result 
of our company-wide drive to enhance the customer 
experience, in December our on-time performance 
was close to 84%, which is extremely commendable. 
Additionally, our new and significantly improved AI 
chatbot AskBo has been elevating our customer service, 
helping us to answer more queries more efficiently.
Sustainability
Now that the pandemic has abated, the most pressing 
sustainability issue facing the world is climate change. 
The effects are incontrovertible; floods, typhoons, 
drought, forest fires and unusually hot temperatures 
are frequent reminders that everyone – governments, 
businesses, non-governmental and civil organisations 
as well as individuals – need to play our part in reducing 
carbon emissions.
We at Capital A have always prided ourselves on the 
most energy-efficient aviation operations, both for the 
cost as well as environmental benefits. The adoption of 
over 20 green operating procedures has allowed us to 
avoid thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions steadily 
year after year. In 2023, we achieved a reduction 
equivalent to the sequestration of more than two 
million trees, which is substantial. And we can do even 
better. However, some fuel-efficient manoeuvres require 
approval by the relevant authorities. For example, air 
traffic management could be enhanced to reduce the 
need to fly aircraft in a holding pattern while awaiting 
permission to land, as this is extremely fuel inefficient. 
In a strategic move, we have 
integrated our inclusive financial 
platform BigPay into AirAsia MOVE, 
allowing customers to access the 
financial services they need for 
travel and more. 
The initiative contributed to a 60% surge in the closed loop payment 
business YoY. Meanwhile, BigPay is rapidly becoming regional, enabling 
DuitNow QR payments in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. 
It has also launched a Thai operation and is partnering UnionDigital 
Bank in the Philippines to serve this market.  
Capital A International
While letting go of AirAsia the airlines, Capital A has plans to further 
build the brand and monetise it the way other IP-led companies such 
as Disney have done with their brands. This new business direction 
comes under the purview of Capital A International, our latest 
business, driven by AirAsia brand co. (Abc.), which was established 
in January 2023. The idea is to become a leading global brands and 
IP management powerhouse, leveraging our two-decade legacy of 
AirAsia brand assets and brand management expertise. While the lead 
brand is AirAsia, our portfolio extends from Santan to ADE and even 
BIG.
Our vision is to infuse our ethos of value, inclusivity and efficiency into 
diverse industries via ventures such as airasia academy, AirAsia Ride 
and, possibly in future, AirAsia Hotel and maybe even AirAsia Hospital. 
RedBeat Capital
RedBeat Capital currently supports two companies – airasia academy 
and ikhlas.com – both of which are growing from strength to strength. 
The academy’s platform has been used to replace the Workday 
Learning Management System across Capital A. Externally, the team is 
forming numerous partnerships with government agencies, especially 
in the area of technical training, and is looking into the possibility 
of creating a TVET marketplace linking institutions and industry. 
Meanwhile, along with travel recovery, IKHLAS Umrah packages have 
finally taken off, and the team is developing non-pilgrimage related 
Muslim-friendly travel packages to exciting destinations all over the 
world as it taps into the growing niche market.

Business Review
2023 Overview
The year 2023 saw a significant pick-up in the Aviation business along 
with a reopening of international borders and greater confidence 
among guests to travel – both domestically and to foreign destinations. 
The main challenge was to reactivate aircraft quickly enough to meet 
this surge in demand in the face of hangar unavailability at MRO 
facilities worldwide as well as a shortage of parts and components 
due to supply chain disruption. The turnaround time at MROs was also 
longer than usual because of prolonged aircraft hibernation. 
Nevertheless, we were able to increase our operating fleet size from 
126 aircraft at the beginning of the year to 167 aircraft at year end. 
Although total seat capacity was 74% of that in 2019, pre-pandemic, 
the number of guests flown was 77% of that in 2019 – because of the 
high load factor, which averaged 88% across all AOCs. Spurred by the 
removal of entry visa requirements for nationals from China and India 
by the Malaysian Government, and a reciprocal arrangement by the 
Beijing administration, there was marked increase in capacity to these 
two markets towards the end of 2023. 
Supporting our financial performance, airfares increased across the 
board due to decreased domestic competition in Malaysia and Thailand 
together with more rational behaviour, in part reflecting higher aircraft 
operating costs. Airfares were on average 14% higher YoY and 26% 
higher than in 2019, helping to boost the Aviation Group’s revenue to 
RM13.4 billion, marking a 141% increase vs 2022.
The group’s revenue uplift was fuelled substantially by ancillary income, 
which increased by 165% YoY, mainly as a result of pricing optimisation 
through big data and dynamic bundling, personalised offers based 
on guests’ purchase behaviour and the launch of innovative products 
like Fastpass enabling express immigration at selected airports, and 
ZoneUp allowing guests to bid for seat upgrades. During the year, 
we also launched an enhanced travel insurance package, AirAsia 
Comprehensive Travel PLUS. Notably, ancillary income hit RM48 
per pax, bringing the total ancillary income recorded in FY2023 to 
RM2.4 billion.
Although the cost of operations increased with the depreciation of 
the Ringgit against the US Dollar and increasing jet fuel prices in the 
second half of the year, the Aviation Group was able to deliver an 
285% increase in EBITDA from RM393 million in 2022 to RM1.5 billion.
Collectively known as AirAsia, the Aviation business represents not 
only the first successful low-cost airline in Asean, it is also widely 
acknowledged as being the best low-cost airline in the world, winning 
the Skytrax award 14 years running. Though badly affected by the 
pandemic, AirAsia survived the two-year flying hiatus, emerging in 
2022 as a leaner organisation having shed its AOCs in India and Japan. 
Currently, the Group aim to obtain Bursa Malaysia’s approval on the 
disposal of the Aviation Group to AirAsia Group in Q2 2024.

The Aviation business comprises all our airline operating companies under AirAsia 
Aviation Group Limited (AAAGL) and AirAsia Berhad (AAB), namely AirAsia Malaysia 
(MAA), AirAsia Thailand (TAA), AirAsia Indonesia (IAA), AirAsia Philippines (PAA) 
and, most recently, AirAsia Cambodia, which is to start commercial operations in 
2024.
Today, many are excited about the potential of sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF). We, too, are fully supportive of SAF and look forward to using it… 
so long as it is economically viable. The reality is that SAF is currently 
very expensive, and various challenges, including land use as well as 
feedstock shortage, need to be overcome if biofuel production is to 
reach the scale needed for commercial aviation use.
These challenges aside, we have committed to becoming a net-zero 
carbon organisation by 2050. While driving optimum fuel efficiencies 
through operational manoeuvres, we recognise this will not be enough. 
To aid us in our net-zero journey, we will be investing in carbon offsets 
funded by a soon-to-be-implemented carbon fee in our airfares. Our 
focus will be on carbon projects in Asean, to advance the carbon 
markets and enhance regional sustainability efforts in general.
In terms of creating social value, our business promise right from the 
start – “now everyone can fly” – was premised on a key sustainability 
principle of creating greater equity among people. Along the way, 
we started connecting second and third tier cities in our growing 
network, increasing tourism to these areas and promoting economic 
development. Then, in 2012, we set up the AirAsia Foundation which 
distributes seed grants to social enterprises across the region. To date, 
it has supported 32 enterprises directly impacting 3,375 beneficiaries 
and 12,206 families and communities. Going forward, we will be working 
with the Foundation towards promoting sustainable tourism, as this 
would create positive social as well as environmental outcomes.
Meanwhile, greater corporatisation of Capital A has necessitated added 
emphasis on good governance. Part of this is to establish greater 
independence on our boards for better checks and balances ensuring 
the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders are protected. 
Accordingly, when we set up AirAsia Aviation Group to house our 
aviation business, we elected as Chairman Tan Sri Jamaluddin Ibrahim, 
the former CEO of Axiata Group Bhd who has no previous ties with 
Capital A. Neither of us is on the board, nor will we be on the board of 
AirAsia Group post-disposal.
The Board of Capital A itself comprised 50% independent directors, 
meeting Bursa Malaysia’s stipulated minimum. On 31 January 2022, 
we appointed our newest (independent) Director, Surina binti Shukri, 
formerly the CEO of MDEC, a firm advocate of gender equality who 
brought with her many years of experience in the fields of finance and 
technology primarily in New York and Kuala Lumpur. Surina always 
lifted our discussions with her energy and fresh perspectives. It was 
with deep sadness that we heard of her passing on 29 February 2024 
following a long battle with cancer. We will remember her as a leader, 
a visionary and a friend, whose legacy will continue to guide us as we 
navigate the path she helped shine. 
Outlook
The year 2024 has started on a promising note despite ongoing 
geopolitical uncertainties. The prevailing consensus is that jet fuel prices 
will continue to decrease and that the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate 
cuts will lead to a favourable shift in the US dollar against key Asean 
currencies. This will be a significant boon for us given that 70% of our 
costs are denominated in US dollars.
While “revenge travel” was a prominent trend in the Western world in 
2022 and 2023, the phenomenon is gaining momentum in 2023 and 
2024 in Asian markets, which have been slower to open up. 
This will be further boosted by easing of tourist visa requirements, 
especially with regard to travel to/from the largest markets in the 
region, China and India. 
These factors collectively signal a positive outlook for our aviation 
and aviation-related businesses, the latter including Capital A Aviation 
Services, Teleport and MOVE Digital. Teleport, in particular, stands to 
benefit greatly from this optimistic outlook. As yields in the intra-Asean 
air cargo space are expected to outpace the global air cargo market’s 
projected 2%-3% growth in the first half of 2024, our cost-effective 
structure will be to Teleport’s advantage.
With the big picture above in mind, in 2024 we will continue the journey 
that we started in 2023, focusing on five strategic themes, namely:
• Operational excellence: A highly pr
oductive and efficient 
organisation dedicated to delivering best-in-class products that 
precisely meet customer needs. 
• Financial sustainability: Cost conscious and lowes
t cost in our 
operating spaces, financially disciplined and focused on delivering 
positive cashflow and getting the best returns.
• Data and tech driven: Data informed in all we do
, leveraging insights 
and analytics to make fast, precise decisions while leveraging AI and 
technology to stay true to our innovative DNA.
• Customer obsessed: Putting cust
omers at the heart of everything 
we do, and continuously delight and overdeliver by ensuring they 
are served by engaged and empowered Allstars.
• Fixing the organisation: Rejuvenate our people-firs
t and continuous 
improvement culture as an organisation and refocus on providing 
great customer experience.
At the same time, we seek to grow our four companies aggressively. 
Barring unforeseen circumstances, Capital A International will become 
the next big global brand/IP management company. As for the 
remaining businesses, the aim is to undertake corporate exercises to 
unlock their value subject to conducive market conditions and the 
requisite approvals. MOVE Digital, Teleport and Capital A Aviation 
Services may see possible spin-off listings or merger and acquisition 
exercises. The final business to remain will inherit the listing status of 
Capital A Berhad.
It promises to be another bustling year ahead, but one we are confident 
will create clarity on our business direction and demonstrate the 
intrinsic value of all our business verticals to our shareholders. We take 
this opportunity to express heartfelt gratitude to all our shareholders, 
indeed all our stakeholders, for your continued support, especially in 
these challenging few years. Unlocking value for you remains one of 
our top priorities, and we eagerly look forward to doing so as we move 
forward in 2024 and beyond.

Operational Highlights 2023 Key Statistics
AIRASIA THAILAND
TAA fully leveraged the increase in air travel demand in 2023 
to grow its capacity, as measured by available seat kilometres 
(ASK), by no less than 123% YoY. Reactivating its aircraft  faster 
than peers, it achieved significant growth in the domestic sector, 
increasing its market share to a record 35%. In the international 
sector,  following China’s opening to inbound and outbound travel, 
TAA quickly re-established routes into Asia’s biggest tourism hub, 
which remains a popular destination for Thais, and vice versa. 
Other than China, TAA made its first foray into Japan via Fukuoka, 
and maintained its competitiveness in India, where it currently 
serves nine destinations. 
AIRASIA PHILIPPINES
2023 was a year of several small yet important milestones for 
PAA which led to a doubling of its ASK with only a 40% increase 
in number of aircraft during the year. This was achieved through 
more efficient operations, strategic route planning (including 
the introduction of new sky bridges to Chengdu, China; and 
Tokyo, Japan), as well as concerted brand-building efforts post-
pandemic. The latter included active participation in 24 travel fairs 
nationwide organised by travel agency associations, banks and 
tourism boards, together with excellent media coverage. The shift 
of PAA’s domestic operations from Terminal 4 to the more spacious 
Terminal 2 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) was 
an added plus. To support its current and anticipated expansion, 
PAA hired 621 new Allstars for Ground and Flight Operations.
AIRASIA INDONESIA
With the opening of international borders in 2022, IAA quickly  
re-established its strength in this segment, transporting 1.4 million 
international passengers and capturing 11.15% of the market. This 
trend continued into 2023, with IAA’s international market share 
climbing to 13.0%. Supporting its growth, IAA worked diligently to 
rebuild its network of sky bridges, ending the year with 41 routes, 
just three short of the 44 it had pre-pandemic. This included seven 
new routes in 2023 – four domestic and three international. To 
create awareness and stimulate further demand for its routes, it 
organised its first Indonesia AirAsia Travel Fair post-COVID-and 
held four AirAsia Free Seats Campaigns throughout the year.
The year 2024 is looking promising, due to 
more operational aircraft, robust demand and 
lessening competition in domestic Malaysia and 
Thailand. We also look forward to integrating 
our operations with that of AirAsia X as this 
would instantly expand the size of our fleet, 
enabling better economies of scale and more 
flexibility on short and longer-haul routes, while 
growing our route network. We target to obtain 
Bursa Malaysia’s approval on the disposal of the 
Aviation Group to AirAsia Group in Q2 2024 
and, subsequently, our shareholders’ approval 
at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held 
in Q3 2024. 
Combining our short-haul and long-haul 
operations would sharpen our focus, optimise 
capital allocation, and enhance resource 
management within the group by eliminating 
redundancies and paving the way for synergies 
in pricing strategies, network consolidation, and 
operational efficiencies. This would place us on 
a stronger footing to capitalise on increasing 
demand for travel.
While cost pressures remain high, we have put 
in place control measures to ensure efficiencies, 
which will allow us to continue to offer the most 
attractive fares to our customers.
Our main priorities will be to ensure a smooth 
integration into our sister airline as we continue 
to build AirAsia, expanding our fleet, launching 
AirAsia Cambodia, and working with airports 
as well as industry partners for a seamless 
customer experience across every touch point. 
AskBo, our chatbot, has been upgraded and we 
will be launching an e-booklet on AirAsia MOVE 
to guide our guests on how they can make the 
most of the services available on the extended 
AirAsia ecosystem. 
We will also bring out of hibernation the rest of 
our existing fleet and add at least nine aircraft 
in 2024, ending the year with 221 Airbus A320 
and A321 aircraft. This will enable us to further 
expand our route network, bringing back 
popular destinations while introducing exciting 
new routes to not only meet but stimulate 
demand.
Looking Forward
AIRASIA MALAYSIA
As air travel began to normalise, MAA focused on bringing back 
into operations as many aircraft as possible, efficiently and 
sustainably. Along with an expanded fleet, it also continued to 
rebuild its network of sky bridges, focusing on the most popular 
and profitable routes. By year end, it was flying 71 aircraft across 
240 routes. Meanwhile, to mitigate the impact of volatile fuel prices 
and aircraft maintenance charges, added emphasis was placed on 
cost containment while a fuel surcharge fee was introduced. At 
the same time, MAA continued to excite travellers with numerous 
campaigns throughout the year including the ever-popular Five 
Million Free Seats and Fixed Fares promotion, the latter taking 
place during the festive seasons.

The latest industry forecasts suggest operators in Asia will generate the largest share of 
MRO demand in the near future, contributing slightly more than a third of the global total. 
According to Aviation Week, MRO spending in the region will grow at a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5% from USD36 billion in 2024 to USD48 billion in 2033. 
ADE is preparing to tap into this growth via facilities expansion as well as expansion 
geographically. Not only will our new 14-line hangar in KLIA significantly enhance our base 
maintenance capacity, its proximity to our warehouse will translate into quicker turnaround 
times. The new hangar will house workshops such as the seat shop, carpet shop, cabin 
shop and sheet metal and composite shop. With its capacity to accommodate wide-bodied 
aircraft, we will extend our maintenance services to include Airbus A330 aircraft.
Geographically, we seek to establish line maintenance operations in all of AirAsia’s home 
countries – ie Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Cambodia – and expect these to be up 
and running by 2024. We will not, however, restrict ourselves to AirAsia but will actively pursue 
a broader customer base, targeting at least 30% third-party airlines. Propelling ourselves 
further, we are looking at the prospects of entering into a partnership with a prominent MRO 
player in Asean and hope to be able to report on this next year.
In the meantime, ADE will focus on pioneering innovations and launching diverse products 
within our digital ecosystem. With these digital products and our exceptional MRO service 
delivery, we will continue to delight existing customers while attracting more third parties 
into our orbit.
Looking Forward
While developed markets reopened their 
borders in 2022, most of Asia followed 
suit only in 2023. This has led to a drastic 
influx of aircraft into operations after about 
two years of hibernation, requiring intense 
maintenance work. By the third quarter of 
the year, the number of aircraft flying across 
the Asia-Pacific region had almost reached 
pre-pandemic levels. Within AirAsia itself, 
no less than 41 aircraft were operationalised 
during the year. 
The aviation MRO sector in the region 
has therefore been extremely busy, with 
demand for service outstripping existing 
capacity. While all MRO players have stood 
to benefit in this environment, ADE has had 
an upper hand due to our quick turnaround 
time backed by strong aircraft maintenance 
predictive capabilities; the ability to anticipate 
component needs hence maintain strategic 
levels of inventory; as well as our highly 
trained and experienced engineers. Though 
attaining our licence for basic maintenance 
only two-and-a-half years ago, ADE is rapidly 
gaining a reputation for delivering the best 
value and efficiency at the lowest cost across 
the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
Key Initiatives Key Achievements
• On 18 January, we launched our new 5,000 
square metr
e hangar built on 107.4 acres 
at Senai Airport’s Free Industrial Zone 
(SAFIZ), the first MRO facility in Senai, and 
the third for ADE.
• In May, we launched two ground-breaking
 
digital solutions: AEROTRADE and 
ELEVADE FLEET:
- AEROTRADE, the first aviation 
marketplac
e in Asia, harnesses the 
latest technologies to simplify the 
buying and selling process. With over 
USD244 million worth of inventory for 
both Airbus and Boeing aircraft types, it 
is Asia’s first components marketplace. 
- ELEVADE FLEET offers condition 
monit
oring capabilities, advanced 
analytics, fleet tracking and cabin 
monitoring, among others. It is the first 
commercially available, full-fledged 
aircraft health management system of 
its kind in Asia.
• Signed a Letter-of-Intent (LOI) with 
Univ
ersiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) 
on research collaboration in the fields of 
Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
Robotics. 
• In December, we launched ELEVADE 
PEOPLE to r
eplace Workday’s time-
tracking module. The mobile-first 
application simplifies data-capturing and 
monitoring for attendance and overtime 
applications with its GPS-enabled 
geofencing capabilities, eliminating human 
error from the previously manual process.
• Secured USD100 million investment from 
OCP Asia L
td, which will be used for the 
construction and operationalisation of 
our 14-line state-of-the-art hangar facility 
in KLIA; and to fund business expansion in 
other verticals and geographical markets.
• Completed 100th C-Check in less than 
two-and-a-half y
ears, when most MROs 
take about five years. C-Checks are 
comprehensive inspections that ensure 
the airworthiness of aircraft and demand 
extensive tooling, test equipment, and 
special skill levels. 
• Attained EASA Part 145 approv
al from 
the European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency (EASA) complementing an 
extensive array of existing maintenance 
certifications and authorisations. 
• AEROTRADE has attracted more than 150 
airlines, MROs, distribut
ors, OEMs, agents 
and stockists worldwide, becoming an 
active, high-transaction marketplace. As 
at year end, it facilitated more than RM55 
million in transactions, with a growing 
number of transactions taking place 
between non-AirAsia parties.

Our primary focus in 2024 will be on sustainable growth 
across all facets of our business. Through targeted marketing 
efforts, strategic customer engagement and product/
service innovation, we aim to expand our market presence 
and enhance our competitive position. Supporting our 
business growth, we have allocated substantial capital for 
technology upgrades and infrastructure improvements as 
well as talent development – all aimed at further enhancing 
our operational capabilities. As we stay agile, innovative and 
customer centric, we will be well-positioned to capitalise on 
opportunities and drive further value for our stakeholders.
In 2024, Santan will be building on the momentum achieved in 2023 to further grow our business. We are looking to enter into more 
collaborations with local entrepreneurs, in Malaysia and Asean, as well as to fully leverage the potential for expansion within the Capital A 
ecosystem as well as outside of it. This includes growing our corporate catering services, now offered in RedQ, to other Capital A offices 
regionally while also offering our services to third-party airlines. Based on our success with ZUS Coffee and Penang Chendul, we seek to 
expand our retail business through a wider network encompassing partners such as TGV cinemas, Petronas’ Café Mesra, 7-Eleven and 
Jollibee, taking our brand beyond Malaysia to countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.
Looking Forward
Looking Forward
In 2023, both the number of passengers and 
volume of cargo transported in and out of as 
well as within Asia-Pacific grew substantially, 
requiring GTR to ramp up our operations. 
Prioritising punctuality and customer 
satisfaction, we intensified our partner 
collaborations while our Allstars stepped up 
to the mark ensuring a seamless journey for 
every traveller and cargo recipient. GTR’s 
dedication to continuous improvement and 
the delivery of an outstanding customer 
experience contributed to a 99% on-time 
performance (OTT) and the ability to manage 
significantly enhanced cargo throughput 
from Q4 onwards.
As travel picked up in 2023, so did Santan’s 
trajectory. During the year, we refreshed 
our inflight menu, adding an entire range 
of Santan Signature Blend coffee, made 
from 100% coffee beans with no additives; 
a refreshing yuzu series leveraging the zesty 
antioxidant-rich fruit from Japan; as well 
as the very local and very popular chendul. 
A great deal of emphasis was placed on 
building our beverages menu due to the high 
take-up of drinks onboard, as well as better 
margins. 
More than food, Santan has significantly 
enhanced our duty-free offerings with 
fashion and skincare items, fragrances, 
wellness foods and even pet food – all made 
in Malaysia – standing side by side with 
Calvin Klein, Elizabeth Arden, Lancome, 
Laneige, Kiehl’s and other conventional duty-
free inventory. Working closely with local 
entrepreneurs, we are revolutionising the 
concept of duty-free, taking the local global. 
This is part of the AirAsia story of elevating 
Asean not only as a tourist destination, but as 
a region rich in culture, cuisine and craft that 
has a place on the world map.
Key Initiatives
• Turned around more than 36,000 flights efficiently and effectively
, demonstrating the 
capability to manage large numbers of passengers and baggage.
• Handled 86,000 tonnes of cargo, underscoring our str
ength in logistics and cargo 
management.
• Introduced the use of electric vehicles in klia2 for towing baggage and car

has improved the overall standard of ground 
handling in Malaysia. Our Training Department collaborates closely with Sistem Latihan 
Dual Nasional, under the Ministry of Human Resources, to ensure accreditation for our 
trainers. This accreditation enables trainees to obtain a recognised Malaysian Skills Diploma 
(DKM).
•  Introduced the GTR Ambassador Programme
, underscoring our commitment to employee 
development and engagement.
Santan is Capital A’s food service 
business, launched to provide 
inflight catering services and 
evolving over the years to 
encompass all sales in the air, 
including duty-free, as well as 
food services on the ground. True 
to its all-Asean identity, Santan’s 
‘next big thing’ is to promote 
and help local brands grow 
through the AirAsia network. It 
is also rapidly expanding its food 
and beverage (F&B) offerings, 
creating an unparalleled shopping 
and dining experience 3,000 feet 
above land.
Key Initiatives
• Leveraged freez
e-dry technology (which allows coffee to dissolve in water at any 
temperature) to offer guests the robust flavour of freshly brewed coffee in capsule format, 
eliminating the need for inflight coffee machines. 
• Introduced plant-based Pak Nasser’s Nasi L

Business Review (cont’d)
Towards the end of 2023, we realigned the 
business model of AirAsia SEA, the shared 
services centre for our airlines, to become 
a profit-making business on its own. Now 
renamed DARTS, it provides an expanded 
range of corporate services to 77 entities 
across airlines and other verticals in Capital A, 
supporting more than 21,000 Allstars within 
the Capital A ecosystem, its fees based on 
individually agreed service level agreements 
(SLAs). By taking over support services, DARTS 
frees all Capital A entities to focus on their 
core businesses. Among others, DARTS offers: 
Finance Shared Services, Finance Centre of 
Excellence (COE), Customer Happiness, People 
Services, Procurement, Translation, Production, 
Facilities Management & Development, Duty 
Travel and Refund Operations.
In 2023, DARTS continued to cut costs through simplicity 
via digital solutions with the launch of AskBo offering 
a more proactive, attentive and hassle-free guest 
experience, as well as an Allstar self-service chatbot 
elevating the Allstar experience through instant HR-
related support, promoting convenience and efficiency. 
Going forward, DARTS will continue to further enhance 
AskBo capabilities and look into other avenues to create 
operational efficiencies thus minimise cost and boost 
productivity. In addition, it will explore the potential 
of extending its services to non-Capital A third-party 
customers.
As a relatively new startup, the year 2023 
saw Capital A Consultancy continue to build 
brand awareness of our service offerings 
while reaching out to and developing 
relationships with key industry players. 
Having been engaged in 2022 by a customer 
to develop Fly Dhaka, an LCC in Bangladesh, 
a significant amount of time and resources 
were channelled towards this project. In 
addition, we pitched our services to a number 
of new prospective clients; and are currently 
in negotiation with a few of them.  
Within the Group, Capital A Consultancy was 
involved in establishing AirAsia Cambodia, 
AirAsia’s new venture which is set to 
launch in Phnom Penh in 2024. Capital A 
Consultancy took the lead in the joint venture 
negotiations, conducted feasibility studies as 
well as developed a five-year business plan 
for AirAsia Cambodia.
In 2024, we seek to advance ongoing projects and extend the services currently offered 
to customers while translating proposals into new wins. At the same time, we will continue 
with our brand-building efforts by engaging with and pitching our services to new 
prospective clients. Internally, we will build our portfolio of products and services aligning 
these with changing industry needs. Among others, we seek to expand our award-winning 
Fuel Efficiency Programme to new airline clients as sustainability issues gain currency.

MOVE DIGITAL
Starting out as airasia Superapp in 2020 with a broad 
range of product lines, partly to meet the extensive need 
for digital services during the pandemic, in 2023 AirAsia 
MOVE became leaner and more efficient, focusing on 
areas where it has a clear competitive advantage: travel. 
The objective is to leverage AirAsia to offer the best value 
for travel and extend the airline’s well entrenched value-
creating DNA to hotels and fintech products.
Based on insights provided by guest/customer data, the 
team has been able to finetune its portfolio of offerings, 
bringing on board the right hotels and other service 
providers at the right price points that complement its 
customer profile. This has seen the super app take off as 
an online travel agency (OTA), with significant growth in 
non-AirAsia flight and other bookings. The team is now 
exploring more opportunities to disrupt the market by 
going deeper to fill identified gaps and creating even 
greater value for travellers across Asean. 
AirAsia Ride and AirAsia Rewards (together with 
Community) further enrich the super app ecosystem, 
the former connecting the dots for integrated journeys 
and the latter driving increasing value for customers 
while also stimulating greater demand for travel via the 
exchange of stories and experiences on the Community 
platform.
In 2023, along with Capital A’s 
business restructuring, the digital 
arm of Capital A, AirAsia Digital, 
was rebranded as MOVE Digital 
(MOVE) with two businesses 
under its fold – AirAsia MOVE 
(formerly airasia Superapp) 
and our fintech BigPay. The 
rebranding of the super app is in 
line with a pivot to focus more 
intently on travel, reiterating our 
commitment to moving people, 
ideas and innovation forward 
within the travel space.
Doubling down on its strengths in 2023 
and maturing into a full-fledged OTA that 
is laser-focused on its customers’ needs 
have been positive for AirAsia MOVE. While 
AirAsia-related revenue grew along with the 
pickup in travel during the year, there was 
also significant growth in revenue from non-
AirAsia related product offerings, specifically 
hotels, non-AirAsia flights and SNAP (ie hotel 
and flight bundles). 
Revenue was further boosted by AirAsia 
Ride, which benefited from increasing post-
pandemic demand as well as enhanced 
productivity of drivers resulting from various 
measures to create a win-win environment 
for Capital A, our drivers and passengers. 
Meanwhile, the AirAsia Rewards programme 
was expanded with more partners, and 
upgraded to make it easier to navigate. 
Coupled with Community, it is contributing 
to AirAsia MOVE becoming not only the most 
convenient app for travellers, seeing to their 
every travel-related need, but also the most 
rewarding (making it cheaper to travel the 
more they travel) and stimulating (enabling 
access to tips and recommendations from 
like-minded fellow travellers).
Overall, net revenue grew by 40% from 
RM239 million in 2022 to RM334 million with 
the number of monthly active users (MAU) 
increasing by a significant 42% to 15 million 
from 11 million in 2022; and the number of 
transactions increasing by 75% YoY. Most 
positively, the super app remained EBITDA 
positive for six consecutive quarters.

REWARDS/COMMUNITY
In 2024, the team at AirAsia MOVE will continue along the trajectory established in 2023, further enhancing its inventory and pricing to offer the 
best travel-related products and services at the best value to customers. Another brand refresh that is to unfold in January and be completed in 
March will reveal a greatly enhanced UI/UX with improved speed and simplicity. 
AirAsia Ride will focus on growing its airport presence across Malaysia, Bangkok and Bali – with emphasis on increased driver productivity and 
completion rates. It will also explore more partnerships to grow its markets. AirAsia Rewards is looking to implement blockchain to preserve the 
value of its rewards and gain greater credibility as a mode of payment, with the ultimate objective of becoming the best OTA loyalty programme. 
Meanwhile, AI will be incorporated into the Community platform to enhance peer-to-peer interaction.
Integrating BigPay into the super app, new fintech products will be introduced. Among others, the team is exploring the viability of offering loans 
and instalment programmes to guests to reduce the one-time burden of big trips. 
Overall, users can look forward to an enhanced experience with even better payment options and the ability to earn rewards easier. The team’s 
commitment is to enable customers to find better deals than ever before for all their travel needs within Asean and beyond.
Looking Forward
The finance app market is growing rapidly, 
with the digital economy poised to reach USD1 
trillion by 2030, and PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC) predicting a more than five-fold 
growth in e-wallet payments in Southeast 
Asia from USD22 billion in 2019 to over 
USD114 billion by 2025. This growth has 
been driven by and will continue to drive the 
emergence of an increasing number of digital 
financial services.
Being one of the earlier movers in Asean, 
where we have made our mark, BigPay is 
now focused on differentiating our services, 
including via closer collaboration with the 
Capital A ecosystem. On 10 October 2023, 
BigPay launched an exclusive embedded 
wallet solution for payments within AirAsia 
MOVE, bringing a seamless below-the-
surface payment experience for the super 
app users. This, together with a radical design 
uplift to simplify and make our financial 
services more accessible, and the launch of 
useful new features, has seen BigPay grow 
significantly and achieve a milestone. For 
the first time ever, we have cut through the 
red barrier by recording a gross profit in the 
fourth quarter of the financial year.
Key Initiatives
• Launched an embedded wallet version 
of BigPay in AirAsia MOVE, to be followed soon 
by a ‘Lite’ version that will not require AirAsia MOVE customers to download BigPay. Both 
products will facilitate payments and transactions while bringing significant cost savings 
and other upsides to the Capital A ecosystem.
• Unveiled a new redesign centring on easy visibility 
of transaction information via the core 
financial feed on the home screen, and the dedicated analytics screen. 
• Became one of the first e-wallets to launch cross-bor
der DuitNow QR capabilities enabling 
customers to top up their Malaysian wallet and pay using QR codes in China (through 
Alipay), Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.
• Made available a virtual version of our VISA card, complementing the DuitNo
w QR feature, 
so customers can sign up and start paying virtually for everything. 
• Obtained an e-wallet license in Thailand and launched BigPay T
hailand. 
• Partnering with UnionDigital Bank to 
serve the Philippines market with secure and 
frictionless financial services.
BigPay, founded in 2017, is a leading Southeast Asian financial services app. Developed within the Capital A ecosystem, it is imbued with the ethos of enhancing financial well-being in the region by providing approachable financial services digitally. From payments, international transfers, credit, micro-insurance and personal loans to money management, the goal is to provide the financial services that Southeast Asians need to better themselves, hence our mission of levelling up lives, one transaction at a time. 
Having already achieved gross profitability in the last quarter of 2023, the team is aiming to 
become EBITDA positive within 2024. This will be anchored on accelerating the development of 
differentiated mission-based features to level up lives in Asean. We plan to further enhance our 
lending product to deliver checkout financing, more purpose-led lending and novel repayment 
features through round-ups and/or top-ups. We are also looking to empower users and give them 
control of their financial well-being by building better money management and analytics features. 
In addition, the team will grow our remittance business, especially by helping migrant workers send 
money back to loved ones in simpler, cost-competitive ways.
At the same time, we will be enhancing the overall BigPay experience in AirAsia MOVE via the 
incorporation of more features that add value, like BigPay Lite. Among others, we may introduce 
a subscription product to maximise synergistic value for both users and the overall Capital A 
ecosystem.
A natural progression will be to go beyond the Capital A ecosystem to create a broader marketplace 
linking to third-party ecosystems and their products as well as services.
While expanding our offerings, we will continue to strengthen our technology and infrastructure 
for better system reliability while maintaining security and cost efficiencies. Along with Capital 
A, we will also expand geographically across Southeast Asia, Thailand being just the start of our 
journey.

We look forward to the year 2024, which promises to be more positive for cross-border 
logistics. The global air cargo sector is expected to grow by 4.5% based on a renewed pick 
up in trade, with IATA predicting that demand in Asia Pacific will rise by 3.6%. This outlook is 
positive for all air cargo players, and will be an even greater boost to Teleport. 
Teleport will focus our efforts on three key strategies anchored on growing our network, 
capacity and end-to-end operations to strengthen our next-day proposition. Firstly, we seek 
to grow our core network beyond AirAsia as we continue to collaborate with more strategic 
partner airlines. Secondly, we are looking to extend and strengthen our end-to-end operational 
capabilities with multi-modal, first-to-last-mile capabilities in key markets, to support the 
delivery promise of reliable, affordable, next-day cross-border logistics solutions in Southeast 
Asia. Lastly, we aim to develop a pioneering next-day e-commerce solution between China and 
Asean, and position Teleport as the first point of contact for e-commerce volumes moving into 
Asean.
This remains true to our mission - to move things across Southeast Asia better than anyone 
else - being faster, more affordable and reliable. Teleport it.
Looking Forward
The macro backdrop in 2023 was very 
challenging for global air cargo as full-year 
global volumes declined 5% year on year, 
mirroring 4% and 6% declines year on year 
in Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific volumes, 
respectively. The double-digit growth of belly 
capacity, particularly from Asia-Pacific as 
airlines recovered, led to a 40% contraction 
in overall industry yields. Jet fuel prices 
exceeded USD100/barrel for the second half 
of 2023, adding to continued inflation and 
cost pressures impacting overall e-commerce 
growth.
Despite this challenging backdrop, Teleport 
delivered its best year. We set out with a clear 
target and roadmap to be the market leader 
in Asean. By June 2023, we successfully 
achieved our No. 1 Asean air logistics position 
by moving the most intra-Asean volume in the 
region. Year on year, total tonnage grew 88% 
to 200,000 tonnes while our e-commerce 
segment surpassed daily delivery volumes of 
82,000 parcels. Cumulatively, we delivered a 
total of 30 million parcels in 2023, marking 
275% growth year on year.
This achievement was supported by the 
recovery and further strengthening of our 
network and capacity based on three key 
factors: one, the recovery of AirAsia flights, 
which saw 161 aircraft back in the air in 2023; 
two, the establishment of key partnerships 
with over 30 third-party partner airlines, 
which allowed us to extend our network and 
enhance capacity on key lanes; and, lastly, 
the injection of three Airbus A321 Freighters 
(A321F) into our fleet, giving us the added 
control to teleport larger, palletised and more 
types of cargo across the network. 
Key Initiatives Key Achievements
• Three Airbus A321 Freighters were 
induct
ed into our fleet to complement 
our extensive belly capacity network. All 
three freighters - ‘Awan’, ‘Pari’ and ‘Bei 
Long’ - arrived ahead of schedule and 
were successfully operationalised within 
the second half of 2023. 
• The first of three freighters, Aw
an, was 
officially unveiled by His Majesty Seri 
Paduka Baginda Yang Di-Pertuan Agong 
XVII Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-
Mustafa Billah Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan 
Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta’in Billah, as 
the Guest of Honour, at a launch event 
that took place in July 2023. 
• Teleport’s network and capacity were 
further s
trengthened with interlining 
agreements signed with over 30 airline 
partners including Emirates, Garuda 
Indonesia, SF Airlines and United Parcel 
Service (UPS) - to better connect Asean 
with Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world 
to Asean.
• The Teleport Way was introduc
ed – our 
four core values ( Aim to Pioneer, Move 
with Urgency, Do it with Intent, and Keep 
it Real) refreshed to bring all Teleporters 
across seven markets together with a 
single vision, drive and way of working.
• We are now Asean’s #1 air logistics service 
pr
ovider in terms of total volume moved 
within the region, and Top 10 within Asia 
Pacific overall.
• Bucking industry norms, Teleport has 
pro
ven that freighters can be operated 
profitably with Awan clocking a load 
factor of close to 60% within just four 
months of induction into the fleet.
• In 2023, we teleported 30 million 
e-commerc
e parcels, compared to 8 
million parcels in 2022, reflecting 275% 
growth year on year. This was achieved 
by actively growing our e-commerce 
business through the acquisition of new 
customers such as JD.com and Ninjavan 
and deepening our end-to-end offerings 
with existing customers such as Shopee 
and J&T. 
• Cargo volume delivered 
grew by 88% 
year on year, having uplifted 200,000 
tonnes in 2023 from 105,600 tonnes in 
2022.
• Revenue grew more than 50% y
ear 
on year to USD162 million, and we are 
profitable, generating USD3.4 million in 
full-year EBITDA.

Abc. was established with a forward-looking vision and is ready to see this vision unfold from 2024 onwards. Two top-most priorities are: 1) to 
expand from building brand equity in Asean to the global stage; and 2) to leverage the massive untapped potential in the IP licensing industry. 
Our focus over the next few years is as follows:
Brand: Develop brand messages that champion Asean, and sub-brands that strengthen brand equity in the travel sector to drive desirability for 
association. On top of this, we will strengthen the governance of brand use across the Group.
IP Development: Build traction for airasia buds while exploring the development of new entertainment IP leveraging multiple media touchpoints 
that drive the narrative of championing Asean. We will also pitch for funds from potential investors and partners for capital-intensive projects 
such as animation.
Licensing & Merchandising: Continue to introduce lifestyle-focused merchandise, prioritising both quality and affordability. Additionally, we 
will pursue collaborations and licensing opportunities with the AirAsia brand, expand our presence by bringing our intellectual property and 
merchandise into retail spaces, and actively engage in trade shows, industry publications, and strategic partnerships to connect with key players 
in the licensing industry to establish Abc. as a licensor.
Looking Forward
Since Abc. was established in January 2023, 
we have focused on strengthening and 
future-proofing our brand. A great deal of 
research has gone into how we can appeal 
to the current generation and connect with 
the next generation (Gen Z/Alpha) so they 
grow with us. At the same time, we have 
been working on tightening other aspects of 
Capital A branding, such as internal branding 
through Allstars. 
Other than branding, we have been building 
our character IP, airasia buds, with exciting 
plans in the pipeline for 2024. We have also 
revamped AirAsia’s merchandising strategy 
to focus on lifestyle products that resonate 
with our customers, offering exclusive 
collections every quarter and continuously 
refreshing our core merchandise line-up. 
All of this builds the overall AirAsia brand 
experience - strengthening our brand equity 
in the travel space and beyond as we venture 
into new industries. 
Key Initiatives Key Achievements
• The development of new brand identities 
for ne
w businesses under Capital A 
covering logos, creative guidelines, tone 
of voice and strategies on how the brand 
should be perceived.
• Reviewing and tightening existing 
br
ands through their guidelines with the 
objective of ensuring all brands under 
the Group are understood internally and 
represented well externally. 
• Development of brand visual directions 
for ke
y festivals such as Chinese New 
Year, Raya, Merdeka and Christmas, 
exploring the use of Generative AI in our 
first campaign for Merdeka/Malaysia Day. 
• Partnered with SEGA to host our 
first R
edGames Jam, leading to the 
development of our very own AirAsia 
game IP for AirAsia MOVE.
• Developed “NUMS by air
asia” as Capital 
A’s premier retail fast-moving consumer 
goods (FMCG) brand for airasia grocer, 
debuting with two ready-to-drink 
flavours, available for purchase onboard 
AirAsia flights and nationwide in Malaysia.
• Revamped AirAsia’s corpora
te identity 
(to be unveiled in 2024). 
• Revamped Allstars’ visual identity for all 
internal c
ommunications. 
• RedGames Jam hit the limit of 100 
participants within 48 hours, and 
resulted 
in the development of 30 original games. 
The winning game is being fine tuned and 
set to be launched in 2Q2024.

Business Review (cont’d)
Key Initiatives
• IKHLAS Umrah expanded its offerings with exclusiv
e umrah trips featuring influential key opinion 
leaders (KOLs) and celebrities targeting different segments of the umrah demographic. 
• IKHLAS Travel introduc
ed a Play & Stay golf package offering premium golfing experiences at 
affordable rates in Malaysia and the region. It also offered customised itineraries for small groups to 
any destination within the AirAsia network.
• Both IKHLAS Travel & Umrah es
tablished significant partnerships to improve the overall experience 
for Malaysians and other travellers from the region. This included a strategic partnership with Dar 
Al Eiman Investment Co (Dar Al Eiman) to guarantee accommodation for Umrah pilgrims. 
• Strengthening its contingency planning, especially during the peak umrah seasons, IKHLAS Umr
ah 
developed fast, low-risk solutions for ad-hoc logistics issues. 
• IKHLAS Zakat supported 
our non-seasonal revenue generation through products like Zakat and 
Aqiqah. 
• Following the occupation of Gaza, IKHLA
S Sadaqah reactivated the “IKHLAS for Palestine” 
humanitarian fund together with Malaysian Humanitarian Aid and Relief (MAHAR). 
Key Achievements
• IKHLAS Umrah has established 
a cost-effective approach with a strong Haramain network to ensure 
guaranteed transportation and accommodation for umrah pilgrims even during peak seasons. This 
includes Umrah Visas which allow two Raudhah slots (Tasreh & Nusuk) compared to only one slot 
(Nusuk) for Tourist Visa holders.
• IKHLAS Zakat has successfully bridged the gap betw
een the number of companies contributing 
to skim potongan gaji (SPG) and the collection of zakat. Additionally, the number of Qurban 
transactions also increased substantially.
• IKHLAS Travel 
saw increased demand for private tours from corporates, agencies and prominent 
brands such as Thermomix (Korea), Halo Telco (Batam) and Petite Moi (Japan) and will continue 
to cater for series and private departures in addition to ad hoc/MICE groups, offering flexible 
departures and customised itineraries for the smaller groups.
• To date, “IKHLAS for P
alestine” has collected and distributed RM170,000 worth of aid to more than 
2,000 families in Gaza. The aim is to collect RM1,000,000 to help more affected Palestinians.
Each business segment has clear strategies and goals for the coming year. IKHLAS Zakat targets to double its revenue by expanding its product 
offerings. IKHLAS Travel is set to offer Muslim travellers more than 30 new researched destinations across Asia and Europe, from Almaty to 
Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, IKHLAS Umrah plans to introduce more attractive packages across premium, economy and super economy categories 
to suit different budgets. Under its value-add Umrah Plus option, pilgrims can even stop over in exciting destinations such as Kazakhstan. The 
objective is to capture the interest of more pilgrims across Asean.
Looking Forward
Launched amid the pandemic in October 2020, 
ikhlas.com is a Shariah-compliant travel and lifestyle 
platform tailored as a conduit for Muslims to perform 
their religious obligations with ease. We have various 
segments catering to specific needs. IKHLAS Umrah 
offers umrah packages; IKHLAS Travel arranges 
Muslim-friendly holiday packages; and IKHLAS 
Zakat, Sadaqah, Aqiqah, Fidyah and Qurban support 
obligatory faith-based practices. IKHLAS Zakat 
is a licensed collection agent for six zakat bodies 
in Wilayah Persekutuan, Kedah, Negeri Sembilan, 
Terengganu, Selangor and Penang. All IKHLAS 
Umrah and Travel flights are offered in collaboration 
with AirAsia and sister airline, AirAsia X.
After increasing our brand awareness 
and gaining the trust of Muslims 
from a cross section of market 
segments, ikhlas.com leveraged the 
pick-up in travel to strengthen our 
position in the umrah travel sector in 
2023. Despite price hikes by hotels 
and logistics service providers in 
response to the substantial increase 
in demand, we stayed true to our 
mission of offering affordable options 
for pilgrims without compromising 
on comfort or convenience, even in 
our premium package options. At 
the same time, we capitalised on 
travel demand to introduce attractive 
holiday packages as we expanded 
our network of Muslim-friendly 
destinations. The pick-up in travel also 
spurred us to test the mechanics for 
inflight zakat services including zakat 
fitrah as Muslims flew home to their 
hometowns for Hari Raya Aidilfitri 
celebrations. 
Sustainability Statement
The focus this year is on championing the spirit of doing more with less to resonate with our practice of delivering 
positive sustainable action with the resources we have. In addition, we describe new initiatives introduced as well as 
the progress and achievements of existing initiatives throughout the year. 
This statement should be read along with our 2023 Sustainability Report for a more comprehensive disclosure on our 
sustainability performance.
Capital A Berhad is proud to present 
our first standalone Sustainability 
Report 2023 which provides an 
overview of the Group’s economic, 
environmental and social (EES) 
approach and achievements for the

Sustainability Approach
Our Sustainability Redbook was designed to complement the Group’s five-year business strategy, outlining a net zero roadmap 
as we progress towards our sustainability objectives. Under the economic, environmental and social pillars, we identified six 
strategic drivers to deliver outcomes categorised under 12 material topics. We have set internal time-bound targets for the short, 
medium and long term to track our progress towards our goals. 
As the sustainability landscape is dynamic, we will keep reviewing our goals and targets to improve the Sustainability Redbook 
and align our business objectives with the global sustainability agenda.

Sustainability Governance
Capital A’s Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s sustainability strategy and approach to climate change with the assistance 
of the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee (RMSC). The RMSC, which meets every quarter, is responsible for providing Board-level 
oversight and assessing the Group’s strategic direction, policies, principles and practices on sustainability and risk management matters.
The Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) is a collaborative body consisting of both members of the AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (AAAGL) 
board and independent expert advisors. Its primary role is to offer oversight and guidance on the development and execution of the sustainability 
strategy, as well as the management of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risks and opportunities. With three members of the AAAGL 
board serving on the BSC, regular updates on the progress of sustainability initiatives are communicated to the broader AAAGL board, which 
in turn shares pertinent information with the Capital A board where necessary. Additionally, the CSO is responsible for directly providing any 
significant sustainability updates to the Capital A board as needed.
The RMSC is supported by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) 
who leads the Sustainability Department and spearheads Capital A’s 
sustainability efforts through the Group’s sustainability strategies and 
initiatives. The Sustainability Department’s tasks include reporting, 
identifying key sustainability risks and opportunities, stakeholder 
engagement and implementation of sustainability initiatives. The CSO 
also provides regular updates on sustainability progress to the RMSC 
and Board of Directors, and supports the RMSC in making informed 
decisions that incorporate sustainability perspectives into business 
decisions.
The CSO also chairs the Sustainability Working Group (SWG), a 
cross-functional committee comprising heads of department and 
sustainability representatives from all LOBs. At quarterly SWG 
meetings, matters such as new reporting requirements, best practices 
and ongoing sustainability initiatives are discussed.
During the reporting year, the SWG and the RMSC convened to discuss 
the following matters:
• ESG assessment outcomes 
• Sustainability strategy, tar
gets and initiatives
• Sustainability performance and updates
For more information on our governance, please refer to page 96 of this 
Annual Report.
Introduction of Two Esteemed Sustainability Board Advisers 
Our Aviation arm, AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (AAAGL), has 
a standalone Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) to ensure 
board oversight and guidance specific to aviation sustainability. 
In the second quarter of 2023, we appointed two distinguished 
advisers Tan Sri Dr Jemilah Mahmood, professor of Planetary 
Health and member of advisory councils for Foreign Policy 
Malaysia, Health White Paper and Malaysian Red Crescent, and 
Dr Veerathai Santiprabhob, former Governor of the Bank of 
Thailand.
Their unwavering commitment to sustainability, coupled with 
their extensive expertise serving in public institutions position 
them as invaluable assets to our committee.

Material Matters
Materiality Assessment 
In 2023, we undertook a comprehensive materiality exercise to identify EES issues that are relevant to our business and stakeholders’ expectations. 
The assessment, involving a total of 1,101 key internal and external stakeholders, followed the following three steps:
1. Identify 2. Prioritise 3.  Validate
Following a review of our existing material 
matters, we researched potential material 
issues based on emerging risks, Bursa 
Malaysia’s common set of prescribed 
sustainability matters, international 
sustainability rankings and indices as well as 
peer companies’ sustainability disclosures. A 
total of 12 material matters were identified. 
An online materiality survey was distributed 
to all key stakeholders, inviting them to rank 
our 12 identified material matters according 
to the level of importance to them as well 
as our performance thus far. Results of the 
assessment were plotted in a materiality 
matrix graded from high to very high 
importance.
The final list of material matters, together 
with stakeholder feedback and the 
materiality matrix, were presented to the 
Board of Directors for review and validation.
2023 Materiality Assessment Updates 
• “Health & Safety” has become the most 
important material matt
er from the 
perspective of stakeholders.
• New inclusion of material matters: “Human 
Rights” and “Diversity & Inclusion”.
• “Guest Experience”, “Information Security” 
and “Corpor
ate Governance” continue to 
remain in the Top 5 material matters.
• “Supply Chain Management” has been 
renamed “Sustainable Supply Chain”.
• “Technology & Innovation” has been added 
as a separat
e material matter. 
Note:
In line with Bursa Malaysia’s enhanced sustainability 
requirements under the Listing Requirements on the 
common material matters:
1. “Anti Corruption” is cover
ed under “Corporate 
Governance” 
2. “Energy Management” and “Water” ar
e managed 
under “Climate Strategy” 
3. “Labour Practices and Standards” are managed 
under “Div
ersity & Inclusion” and “Human Rights”
Materiality assessments are integral to our sustainability strategy as they enable us to identify the environmental, 
economic and social (EES) issues that might affect our business and our stakeholders. To ensure that the EES issues 
remain relevant and aligned with current sustainability trends and regulatory shifts, we conduct a materiality assessment 
every two years, and review the material matters annually.

ethical standards and ensuring excellence in CG standards and practices throughout the Company. The Company will strive 
continuously to enhance its overall CG practices to reflect changing conditions and emerging sound principles, as appropriate.
The Board is pleased to present an overview of the Company’s CG practices during the financial year ended 31 December 2023

Principle A: Board Leadership and Effectiveness
1. Board Responsibilities
 The Board is responsible for governing, guiding and o
verseeing the overall management of the Group and retains full 
and effective control over the affairs of the Group. It reviews the Group’s policies and strategies, enforces standards of 
accountability, actively oversees the conduct, management and business affairs of Capital A, and monitors the senior 
management’s performance. The Board ensures the effective discharge of its fiduciary and leadership functions, as well as 
sustains long-term shareholder value while safeguarding the interests of all its stakeholders. It works closely with the senior 
management to ensure that the operations of the Company are conducted prudently within the framework of relevant laws 
and regulations.
 Directors have independent acces
s to the advice and services of the qualified and experienced Company Secretary to 
ensure effective functioning of the Board. The Directors may seek advice from senior management on issues pertaining to 
their respective jurisdiction, as well as independent professional advice in discharging their duties.
 The Board recognises that having clearly defined r
oles and responsibilities for the Board and senior management is 
important to strike a reasonable balance between the strategy foundation and policymaking, while conforming to the roles 
of executive supervision and accountability.

Board Leadership 
and Effectiveness;

Effective Audit and 
Risk Management; and
Principle C:

fiduciary duties. The Board Charter is reviewed as and when necessary and upon any new regulations or laws that may 
have an impact on the discharge of the Board’s responsibilities. The Board Charter is available on the Company’s corporate 
website at www.capitala.com.

Notes: Chairman
 Non-Member
During FYE 2023, the Board met eleven (11) times inclusive of special Boar
d meetings. The Directors complied with the 
MMLR of Bursa Malaysia in relation to meeting attendance. The Board is satisfied with the level of commitment given by its 
members towards fulfilling their duties and responsibilities. The Committees will continue to assist the Board of Capital A 
in discharging its duties.
2. Board Composition
During the financial year
, the Board had six (6) Directors – two (2) Executive Directors, three (3) Independent Non-Executive 
Directors and one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Director. The current size and composition provide an adequate mix 
of knowledge, skills and expertise which assists the Board in effectively discharging its stewardship and responsibilities.
The composition of the Board fulfilled the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia which requires at least two (2) Directors or one-third 
(1/3) of the Board members, whichever is higher, to be Independent Directors. In the event of any vacancy on the Board of 
Directors which results in non-compliance in the composition of the Board, the Board must fill the vacancy within three (3) 
months.
The Board has in place a policy which limits the tenure of an Independent Director to nine (9) years in line with Practice 5.3 
of the MCCG. If the Board intends to retain an Independent Director beyond nine (9) years, it should provide justification and 
seek shareholders’ approval through a two-tier voting process. As of the date of this statement, none of the Independent 
Directors has served the Board for more than nine (9) years.
The Company has implemented procedures for the nomination and election of Directors through the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (NRC). The NRC is responsible for assessing the performance of the Board and Committees, as 
well as making recommendations on the nomination policy, succession planning framework, talent management, training 
programmes and any related matters for the Directors and senior management.
The NRC assesses candidates based on the leadership skills, gender, digital savviness, entrepreneurial mindset, knowledge 
and experience required by Capital A. The Company recognises the benefits of having a diverse Board. 
In line with its Board Diversity Policy, selection of candidates to join the Board is in part dependent on the pool of candidates 
with the necessary skills, knowledge and experience. The NRC will review the nominees for directorship and membership of 
committees by going through their profiles; and will interview the shortlisted candidates to ensure they are suitable and of 
sufficient calibre for recommendation to the Board for approval.
Capital A’s diverse Board includes and makes good use of differences in skills, regional and industry experience, background, 
race, ethnicity, age and other attributes of the Directors. The Board had a composition of 50% independent directors during 
FYE 2023.
The Board has established a Directors’ Fit and Proper Policy which sets out the fit and proper criteria for the appointment 
and re-appointment of Directors to the Boards of the Group. The policy serves as a guide for the NRC and the Board in their 
review and assessment of candidates proposed for appointment to the Board as well as assessment of Directors seeking 
re-election.
The Directors’ Fit and Proper Policy is made available on Capital A’s website at www.capitala.com.
During the year, the Board, through the NRC, conducted the annual assessment on the effectiveness of the Board as a 
whole, the Board Committees, the individual Directors and the term of office and performance of the Audit Committee 
and its members. The NRC reviewed the summary results thereof and recommended proposed improvement(s) to the 
Board for approval. Each Director undertook an evaluation of the Board in terms of its mix and composition, quality of 
information and decision-making, boardroom activities, Board’s relationship with the management, and environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) parameters.
The NRC was satisfied that the Board and Board Committees comprised the right composition of members and provided 
useful recommendations in assisting the Board in its decision-making. Consequently, the conduct of Board meetings was 
efficient and effective. The individual Directors have been good and effective in the overall discharge of functions and 
duties.
An evaluation of the independence of the Independent Directors was also carried out to assess their competency to 
continue in office as independent directors on a self-assessment basis.  It was concluded that each Independent Director 
has fulfilled the criteria for “independent directors” as set out under the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia and are able to carry out 
their duties independently. 
In addition, the NRC also reviewed and recommended to the Board the annual re-election of Directors who are to retire 
pursuant to the Company’s Constitution for shareholders’ approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the 
Company. 
The Constitution of Capital A provides that at least one-third of the Directors are subject to retirement by rotation at each 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company. Each Director must retire from office once every three (3) years and is 
eligible to offer him/herself for re-election or re-appointment. The Constitution of Capital A also provides that a Director 
who is appointed during the year will be subject to re-election at the next AGM following his/her appointment. 
In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, the NRC considers the fit and proper criteria of Character 
and Integrity, Experience and Competence as well as Time and Commitment as outlined in the Directors’ Fit and Proper 
Policy of the Company. 
In compliance with Paragraph 15.08 of the MMLR of Bursa Malaysia, the Directors recognise the importance and value of 
continuous professional development to keep abreast with changes in the aviation and digital industries, as well as new 
statutory and regulatory requirements.

3.1. Remuneration and Succession Planning
 The Company places strong emphasis on the de
velopment and growth of its staff, fondly known as Allstars. This is evidenced 
by Capital A’s continuous commitment to grooming successors across the Group, in the spirit of One AirAsia. A Group Talent 
Policy and Succession Planning Framework have been instituted to identify and build a robust Group talent pipeline. Talent 
reviews are conducted with senior management to calibrate and map talent needs across the Group’s different locations 
and identify future leaders.
 The Group Talent function oversees structur
ed talent entry and development initiatives, including leadership development 
programmes, coaching, cross-functional and cross-country assignments.
Principle B: Effective Audit and Risk Management
1. Audit Committee 
 
 The Audit Committee 
(AC) of the Company comprises two (2) Independent Non-Executive Directors and one (1) Non-
Independent Non-Executive Director. The AC is chaired by Dato’ Mohamed Khadar bin Merican, who is an Independent 
Non-Executive Director of the Company. The chairman of the AC is not the chairman of the Board. 
 The AC comprises members from diverse backgr
ounds with a wide range of qualifications, skills and experience necessary 
to discharge their duties. The Company has a policy that requires a former key audit partner to observe a cooling-off period 
of at least three (3) years before qualifying for appointment to the AC. None of the current members of the AC is a former 
key audit partner of the Group’s auditors.
 A summary of the work done by the AC during the financial year is set out in the Audit Committ
ee Report in the Annual 
Report.
2. Risk Management and Internal Control Framework
 The Board has established a Risk Management and Sustainability Committee (RMSC) t
o oversee the risk management 
framework, policies and sustainability initiatives of the Group. As at FYE 2023, the RMSC of the Company comprises three 
(3) Non-Executive Directors, a majority of whom are Independent Directors. It is chaired by Dato’ Abdel Aziz @ Abdul Aziz 
bin Abu Bakar, who is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company. 
 The RMSC enables the Board to identify, evalua
te and manage key areas of risk exposures and sustainability performance 
to safeguard the Company’s assets, and meet the expectations of its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. 
 In fulfilling its responsibilities in risk management and sustainability, the RMSC is assisted b
y the Risk Management 
Department and Group Sustainability Department, respectively.
 A management-level risk committee (MRC) was established in 20
19 to increase the participation of senior management in 
risk management processes. The MRC is tasked with reviewing the key risks of Capital A prior to submission to the RMSC 
every quarter.
 Similarly, sustainability concerns are driven b
y a Sustainability Working Group (SWG), headed by the Chief Sustainability 
officer and assisted by the respective heads of department. 
 The SWG submits the Company’s pr
ogress to the RMSC on a quarterly basis, following which the RMSC reports to the 
Board. 
 Further information on the risk management and internal controls within the Group is set out in the S
tatement of Risk 
Management and Internal Control in the Annual Report.
Principle C: Integrity in Corporate Reporting and Meaningful Relationship with Stakeholders

egularly and effectively with shareholders and investors. Information on 
the Group’s business activities and financial performance is disseminated through various mediums including the general 
meetings, annual reports, quarterly announcements on financial results, relevant announcements and circulars to Bursa 
Malaysia and through the Company’s website at www.capitala.com.

elations team which supports the senior management in their active participation 
in investor relations activities, including road shows, conferences and quarterly investor briefings with financial analysts,

s Corporate Governance Guidelines with regards 
to the handling and disclosure of material information to the public. All disclosures of material corporate information are 
disseminated in an accurate, clear and timely manner via Bursa Malaysia announcements. 
2. Conduct of General Meetings

provides an opportunity for shareholders to seek clarification on any queries they may have and to better understand the 
Group’s performance, financial position and other matters of concern. Shareholders are encouraged to actively participate 
in the question and answer (“Q&A”) session.
 The AGM in 2023 was conducted on a fully virtual basis thr

the proceedings of the AGM and posed questions to the Board via real-time submission of typed text and also cast their 
votes online via RPV. All the Directors, Chief Financial Officer, management team and external auditors were in attendance 
at the AGM and responded to shareholders’ questions during the meeting.
 The Company will continue to lev
erage technology to conduct the upcoming AGM virtually through live streaming and 
online remote voting via the RPV. This will enable shareholders to participate fully in the AGM without the need to be 
physically present at the venue.
 Pursuant to Paragr
aph 8.29A of the Listing Requirements, all the resolutions set out in the notice of AGM of the Company 
will be put to vote by poll and an independent scrutineer will be appointed to validate the votes cast at the AGM. The

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION 
The Group has a well-established in-house GIAD to assist the AC in carrying out its functions. The GIAD maintains its independence through 
reporting directly to the AC. The GIAD plans and supervises internal audit services across all subsidiaries and associated companies in the Group, 
including the various Airline Operating Companies (AOCs). The internal audit teams in the respective AOCs have a reporting line to the Head of 
Group Internal Audit. The GIAD reviews and compiles their reports in the form of a Group Internal Audit Report to be submitted and presented 
to the AC for its review and deliberation. 
The GIAD is guided by its IAC which provides independence and reflects the roles, responsibilities, accountability and scope of work of the 
department and is aligned with the International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) on Internal Auditing issued by the Institute of Internal 
Auditors. The Head of Group Internal Audit reports functionally to the AC and administratively to the GCFO of Capital A. 
The principal responsibility of the GIAD is to undertake regular and systematic reviews of the systems of internal controls so as to provide 
reasonable assurance that the systems continue to operate efficiently and effectively. The GIAD adopts a risk-based audit methodology with 
reference to the five elements of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), i.e. control environment, 
risk assessment, control activity, information and communication as well as monitoring, to develop its audit plans by determining the priorities 
of the internal audit activities, consistent with the strategies of the Group. Based on risk assessments performed, greater focus and appropriate 
review intervals are set for higher risk activities, and material internal controls, including compliance with Capital A’s policies, procedures and 
regulatory responsibilities. 
The audits cover the review of the adequacy of risk management, the strength and effectiveness of the internal controls, compliance with both 
internal and statutory requirements, governance and management efficiency, among others. The audit reports are submitted to the AC for 
review. Key control issues and agreed action plans are highlighted to enable the AC to execute its oversight function. The agreed action plans are 
also forwarded to the Management for their attention and further action. The Management is responsible for the implementation of corrective 
actions within the required time frame. 
On 11 January 2024, GIAD confirmed its organisational independence to the AC, with the Head of Group Internal Audit and all internal auditors 
signing the Annual Code of Ethics and Conflict of Interest Declaration for the financial year indicating they were and had been independent, 
objective and in compliance with the Code of Ethics and Conflict of Interest as per IPPF in carrying out their duties for the financial year. 
The AC reviews and approves the human resources requirements of GIAD and IADs in other AOCs to ensure the function is adequately resourced 
with competent and proficient internal auditors.
The total costs incurred by GIAD in discharging its functions and responsibilities during the financial year amounted to RM1,882,963 compared 
to RM1,963,812 in the financial year ended 31 December 2022.
Further information on the resources and the name and qualifications of the Head of Group Internal Audit are provided in the CG Report in 
accordance with Practice 11.2 of the MCCG. 
INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR 
The GIAD implements a risk-based methodology in establishing its strategic and annual audit plan, which determines the areas or units to be 
audited. During the Financial Year, the AC reviewed, challenged and approved the audit plans for the GIAD and the respective IADs. In doing so, 
the AC ensured, among others, consistency in the audit methodology deployed, as well as robustness in the audit planning process.
The GIAD remains committed to equipping our internal auditors with adequate knowledge and proficiency. About RM15,836 was spent on 
training in the areas of auditing skills, technical skills and personal development via inhouse, online and external training during the Financial Year. 
Each staff attended an average of ten (10) training days for the year.
Further information on the resources, objectivity and independence of the Head of Group Internal Audit and internal auditors are provided in the 
Corporate Governance Report in accordance with Practice 11.2 of the MCCG.
During the financial year, audit reviews were conducted based on the internal audit plan approved by the AC. The GIAD and IADs in other AOCs 
completed and reported on 69 audit assignments, including ad-hoc requests, which were requested by the Board, AC or Senior Management, 
and those which arose from reports pursuant to the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy. The audits covered a wide range of areas, including balance 
sheet reviews of the aviation entities, credit card chargeback processes, reviews of staff claims, duty travel and the leave process, vendor 
payment process, expenses reviews, reviews of outsourcing readiness, engineering, inflight operations, export and import finance processes, 
guest services, ramp and ground support equipment, fuel management, contract management, e-commerce business, cargo, corporate safety, 
finance and accounting and legal processes. They also encompassed key systems such as the Navitaire, Warehouse Management System (WMS) 
and the super app software development methodology.
The Head of Group Internal Audit, together with the respective team leaders, attended the AC meetings to brief the AC on audit results and 
significant matters raised in the detailed GIAD report, including findings provided by the respective IADs. 
Internal audit reports detailing audit findings are provided to Management who respond to the actions to be taken. Monthly follow-ups are 
carried out to monitor the progress of corrective actions until they are completed and closed off. The GIAD submits audit reports to the AC 
every quarter on the status of audit plans, audit findings, and agreed actions to be taken by Management on the findings. The GIAD’s reports and 
follow-up actions are also presented to the relevant Board Committees and CEOs of the AOCs and other Lines of Business (LOBs). 
GIAD digitalisation and data initiatives 
GIAD embraces digitalisation in line with the Group strategy to drive continuous improvement through automation. In Quarter 3 of 2023, 
dashboards to support the continuous auditing of stations were completed. GIAD also introduced the usage of data analytics on engagements 
to increase assurance levels and enhance the efficiency of the audit processes.

KEY RISKS AND MITIGATION

risk culture via engagements and workshops. The focus was also to 
strengthen governance by enhancing the ERM policy to be robust and 
enable a systematic approach in managing risk as the Group moved 
up in the risk maturity path. The policy also incorporated ESG risk 
categories to manage material ESG risks within the Group.
A key initiative in 2023 was to institutionalise an adequate risk 
management process towards driving the right risk culture within the 
Group. The Risk Culture is being driven by a strong tone from the top, 
strengthened/echoed by the middle and executed at the bottom to 
implant the expected values of good risk management behaviour at 
all levels of the organisation.
Group Risk also continued to support the Crisis Management Teams 
across the Group to respond to events affecting business continuity 
and conducted BCP exercises for key systems, functions and stations 
to minimise significant operational disruptions in the event of a crisis 
across the Group. 
The Group’s significant risks and mitigating actions are as highlighted 
in the Key Risks and Mitigation section from pages 48 to 50 of this 
Annual Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Key Internal Control Structure in place to assist the Board to 
maintain a proper internal control system are:
• The Board of Capital A has established four (4) committees, 
namely the A
C, RMSC, Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
(NRC) and Safety Review Board (SRB) to assist it in executing its 
governance responsibilities. Further information on the various 
Committees of the Board is provided in the Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement from pages 96 to 103 of this Annual Report.
• Regular management and operations 
meetings are conducted by 
Senior Management of the various Lines of Business within the 
Group.
• The authority delineates authorisation 
limits for various levels 
of management and matters reserved for collective decision by 
the Board to ensure proper identification of accountabilities and 
segregation of duties.
• Internal policies, procedures and proces
ses are documented, 
periodically reviewed and readily made available to employees 
across the Group.
• A detailed budgeting process has been established. In addition, 
the Group has a reporting s
ystem on actual performance against 
the approved budgets, which requires explanations for significant 
variances and plans by Management to address such variances.
• The Safety Department with oversight of the SRB and Group 
Safety
, provides strategic high-level decisions and guidance to 
ensure the risks of aviation and operational activities are reduced 
and controlled to a safe and efficient level. Full compliance with 
regular health and safety audits, as well as IATA Operational 
Safety Audit (IOSA) certification ensures effective safety risk 
management in the Group.
• People and Culture policies and procedures are in plac e to 
govern recruitment, appointment, performance management, 
compensation, reward mechanisms, discipline, termination and 
dismissal of employees and ensure compliance of the same with 
all applicable laws and regulations.
• The Group maintains adequate insurance and ph
ysical safeguards 
on assets to ensure these are sufficiently covered against any 
incident that could result in material losses.
• Information and Data Sec
urity systems, policies, standards, 
procedures, guidelines, organisation structures and processes 
have been established to ensure confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of information.
• The Group has a Code of Conduct (the Code) tha
t sets out the 
standards and ethics that everyone in Capital A is expected to 
adhere to. The Code also sets out the circumstances in which an 
employee, officer or director would be deemed to have breached 
the Code, after due inquiry, and disciplinary actions that can be 
taken against them if proven guilty.
• The Whistleblowing Policy pr
ovides a platform for employees and 
third parties to report instances of unethical behaviour, actual 
or suspected fraud or dishonesty, or a violation of the Code in 
a safe and confidential manner through the Whistleblowing 
Channel (www.capitala.com/whistleblowing_channel.html). The 
Group expects its employees to act in the Group’s best interest 
and maintain high principles and ethical values. The Group will 
not tolerate any irresponsible or unethical behaviour that would 
jeopardise its good standing and reputation.
CONCLUSION
Adequacy and Effectiveness of the Group’s Risk Management and 
Internal Control Systems
The Board has received assurance from the Group Chief Executive 
Officer (GCEO), Presidents and Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO) 
of Capital A that the Group’s risk management and internal control 
system are operating adequately and effectively in all material 
aspects. For areas which require improvement, action plans are 
being developed with implementation dates being monitored by the 
respective Heads of Department. The Board also receives quarterly 
updates on key risk management and internal control matters through 
its Board Committees. Based on assurance received from Management 
and updates from the Board Committees, the Board is of the view 
that the Group risk management and internal control systems were 
operating adequately and effectively during the financial year under

The disclosure in this statement does not include the risk management 
and internal control practices of Capital A’s material joint ventures.

STATUTORY INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(a) Before the income statements, statements of comprehensive income and statements of financial position of the Group and 
of the Company were made out, the directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of 
allowance for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that 
adequate allowance had been made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to realise their value as shown in the accounting records in 
the ordinary course of business had been written down to an amount which they might be expected to realise.
(b) At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances which would render:
(i) the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; and
(ii) the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
(c) At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances which may have arisen which would render 
adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of  the Group and of the Company misleading or 
inappropriate.
(d) At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the financial statements 
misleading.

Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d.)
Going Concern Assessment (cont’d.)
Management has prepared a cash flow forecast as part of the assessment on whether the Group and the Company will be able 
to continue as a going concern. The going concern assessment was highly subjective as it is largely based on expectations of, 
and estimates made by the Directors. Critical to the going concern assessment are the Directors’ expectations of a succesful 
implementation of a Revenue Bond program, continuous support from the Group’s lessors, and the Directors’ estimates of revenue 
forecast and major operating costs (such as fuel costs and wages) as well as the impact from foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, 
we identified going concern assessment as an area requiring audit focus.
In addressing this area of audit focus, we performed amongst others, the following procedures:
• We held discussions with the management to understand their business plans to respond to the evolving business environment;
• We evaluated the stage of completion of the Revenue Bond program by assessing the confirmed subscribers to the Bond, 
held discussion with the manager of the program and assessed the likelihood of a successful implementation;
• We evaluated the estimates made by the Directors in respect of the revenue forecasts against the historical trend, latest 
quoted prevailing flight ticket prices and available capacity;
• We evaluated the estimates made by the Directors in respect of major operating costs such as fuel costs and wages against 
the Group’s business plans, historical results and external data on the expectation of future prices;
• We evaluated the estimates made by the Directors in respect of foreign exchange rates against external data on the 
expectation of future foreign exchange rates;
• We evaluated the Directors’ expectation of continuous support from the Group’s lessors by assessing the past conduct of the
 
Group’s lessors in allowing payment flexibilities and reviewing payment deferral letters from certain lessors; and 
• We evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures on this matter.
Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. We have determined that there are no key audit 
matters to communicate in our report on the financial statements of the Company. The key audit matters for the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group are described below. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these 
matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section 
of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to 
respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying 
financial statements.
Going Concern Assessment
The Group reported a loss for the year of RM96 million whilst the Company reported a loss for the year of RM1,960 million, for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The Group and the Company reported net operating cash inflows of RM1,413 million 
and RM72 million respectively. As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by RM12,669 
million. In addition, as at 31 December 2023, the Group reported a negative shareholders’ funds of RM8,762 million.

Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d.)
Impairment assessment on financial assets
(a) Impairment assessment of right-of-use assets (“ROU”) and property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
 Refer to Note 3.1, Note 11 and Note 31 to the financial statements.
 At 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of ROU and PPE of the Group are RM12,460 million and RM1,575 million 
respectively. 
 The Group is required to assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be 
impaired or reversal of impairment may be required. If any such indication exists, the Group shall estimate the recoverable 
amount of the asset.
 The Directors have prepared a set of cash flow projections to evaluate the recoverable amounts of ROU and PPE. The 
estimates and assumptions used in the cash flow projections which form the basis of the recoverable amounts attributable 
to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) require significant judgement. These judgements require estimates to be made over 
areas including those relating to future revenues, operating costs, growth rates, projected aircraft usage, aircraft capital 
expenditure, foreign exchange rates and discount rates. As a result, the Group recognised a reversal of impairment on PPE 
of RM11.2 million during the financial year.
 Due to the significant amount of reversal and high degree of estimation and judgement involved, this is a key area of focus 
for our audit.
(b) Impairment assessment of intangible assets
 Refer to Note 3.5 and Note 17 to the financial statements.
 As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s intangible assets included an aggregate goodwill of RM2,169 million relating to 
several subsidiaries, namely, Asia Aviation Public Company Limited (“AAV”) and Velox Technology (Thailand) Company 
Limited (“Velox”). Intangible assets also included 
landing rights of AAV, PT Indonesia AirAsia and Philippines AirAsia Inc. 
of RM2,431 million.
Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d.)
Impairment assessment on financial assets (cont’d.)
(b) Impairment assessment of intangible assets (cont’d.)
 The Group is required to perform annual impairment test of CGUs to which intangible assets have been allocated. The 
Group estimated the recoverable amount of its CGUs based on the value-in-use (“VIU”) model. Estimating the VIU of CGUs 
involves estimating the future cash flows from the CGUs, and discounting them at an appropriate rate. Arising from the 
impairment review, the Group impaired goodwill of RM161 million relating to AAV.
 We focused on the impairment assessment of the intangible assets due to the magnitude of the balance and the subjectivity 
involved. Specifically, we focused on the assumptions applied in respect of revenue growth, cost escalation rates, terminal 
value and discount rates.
In addressing this area of audit focus, we performed amongst others, the following procedures:
• Held discussions with senior management to understand 
the basis of the assumptions used in forming the estimates 
underpinning the assessment of the recoverable amount of the CGUs. These estimates include those relating, future 
revenues, operating costs, growth rates, projected aircraft usage, aircraft capital expenditure, foreign exchange rates, 
discount rates and terminal value, as applicable;
• Assessed the key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based, including, and where relevant, comparing 
them against financial and non-financial historical trends, and external data, as applicable;
• Assessed the arithmetical accuracy of the computations used in assessing the recoverable amount of the CGUs;
• Involved our internal specialists to assess the appropriateness of the discount rates applied in the respective discounted 
cash flow projections; and
• Evaluated the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures of key assumptions used in estimations.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d.)
Aircraft maintenance provisions and liabilities
Refer to Note 3.4 and Note 28 to the financial statements.
 
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s aircraft maintenance provisions and liabilities amounted to RM7,193 million. 
 
The Group operates aircraft that are either owned or held under operating lease arrangements. For the aircraft held under 
operating lease arrangements, the Group is contractually obligated to maintain the aircraft during the lease period and to 
redeliver the aircraft to the lessors at the end of the lease term in certain pre-agreed conditions. Therefore, the Group estimates 
the aircraft maintenance costs required to fulfil these obligations at the end of the lease period and recognises a provision for 
these costs at each reporting date. 
Given the nature of provisions, they are inherently more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position. 
The estimates of the outcome and financial effects are determined by management’s judgement, supplemented by experience 
from similar transactions. Due to the significant magnitude of the provision and the significant judgement involved in estimating 
the cost to be incurred and timing of cash outflows, we consider this to be an area of audit focus.
In addressing this area of audit focus, we performed amongst others, the following procedures:
• Reviewed a sample of the lease agreements to determine the Group’s contractual obligations in respect of aircraft 
maintenance;
• Evaluated the significant assumptions on cost to 
be incurred and applied by the Group in estimating the aircraft maintenance 
provision costs by comparing these assumptions to past industry experience, considered changes to maintenance program 
agreed with service provider, actual billings or quotations by supplier and supplemented by expectations of the future 
economic conditions; and
• Performed arithmetic testing on the accuracy of the computation of the aircraft maintenance provisions as at the reporting 
date.
Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Key Audit Matters (cont’d.)
Recognition of revenue from passenger seat sales and sales in advance
Refer to Note 4(a) to the financial statements for revenue and statement of financial position for sales in advance.
 
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, revenue from passenger seat sales accounted for 75% of the Group’s total 
revenue, as compared to 72% for the financial year ended 31 December 2022. The Group relies on an integrated information 
technology system, which includes the flight reservation system, to process large volumes of data comprising low-value 
transactions from passenger seat sales. The flight reservation system is managed by a third party vendor.
The accounting for revenue from passenger seat sales is susceptible to management override through the posting of manual 
journal entries either in the underlying ledgers or as a consolidation journal.
Due to these factors, there is an increased risk of material misstatement arising from the timing and amount of revenue recognised 
from passenger seat sales. As a result, revenue recognition has been identified as an area of audit focus.
In addressing this area of audit focus, we performed amongst others, the following procedures:
• Obtained an understanding and assessed the Group’s information technology systems and key controls that affect the 
recording of revenue from passenger seat sales. 
As the flight reservation system is managed by a third-party vendor, we 
obtained and assessed the external expert’s report on the operating effectiveness of the key controls over the system;
• Involved our information technology specialists to test the effectiveness of the automated controls of the key modules of the 
information technology system;
• Tested the non-automated controls in place to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenue recognised, including 
timely updating of approved changes to base fares and ancillary fares;
• Conducted data analytics to reconcile the revenue recognised in respect of passenger seat sales and the amount of sales in 
advance to payments received from passengers;
• Corroborated the occurrence of revenue by tracing samples of revenue recognised to settlement reports from financial 
institutions;
• Tested the reconciliation of data between the flight reservation system and the general ledger to ensure the completeness of 
revenue; and
• Performed procedures to verify that revenue from passenger seat sales is recorded in the appropriate accounting period.

Independent Auditors’ Report (cont’d.)
to the members of Capital A Berhad (Incorporated in Malaysia) 
Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; 
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s internal control;
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Directors;
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ 
use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on 
the Group’s and of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the 
Company to cease to continue as a going concern; 
Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ 
report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, and the 2023 annual report, which is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report. 
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not 
and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information identified above and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing 
to report in this regard. 
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate 
the matter to the Directors of the Company and take appropriate action. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
 
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal 
control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using 
the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease 
operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Report on the audit of the financial statements (cont’d.)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and 
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. 
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have 
not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements. 
Other matters
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.1 Basis of preparation (cont’d.)
 These conditions may affect the ability of the Group and the Company to meet their financial obligations as and 
when they fall due.
 The Group and the Company have undertaken the following actions to mitigate this risk as disclosed below:
1. Funding
 The Group is currently engaging in discussion with lenders at different stages for debt and equity 
fundraising, with an estimated amount of RM3 billion. As at the date of this report, the Group has received 
commitment from investors for a Revenue Bond Program of up to USD365 million (equivalent to RM1.68 
billion). The Revenue Bond program entails 
the conversion of outstanding lease payments of USD240 
million (approximately RM1.1 billion) into bond (Tranche 1) and cash inflow of approximately USD125 
million (approximately RM575 million) (Tranche 2) to finance working capital, maintenance cost and lease 
rentals. The revenue bond will be secured against passenger seat sales from identified routes and shares in 
a subsidiary. Tranche 1 of the Revenue Bond has a tenure of 2.5 years whereas Tranche 2 has a tenure of 4 
years. The bond is expected to be issued by mid of 2024.
2. Capacity and Network Management
 For the first quarter of 2024, the Group is implementing all possible measures to return the grounded fleet 
to service, with an estimated completion by mid of 2024.
 This is based on the Directors’ cash flow projections with major assumptions being the Directors’ expectations of 
the recovery in passenger numbers arising from the resumption of domestic and international travel, the volatility 
of major operating costs and the continuous support of the Group’s aircraft lessors as well as the debt raise under 
Revenue Bond Program. The Directors believe that the Group will continue to receive support from its lessors and 
complete the implementation of the Revenue Bond Program. Based on the cash flow forecast which incorporates 
the actions taken to date, the Directors concluded that there is no material uncertainty on the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as going concerns. The Directors have accordingly prepared the financial statements 
of the Group and the Company on a going concern basis.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.1 Basis of preparation (cont’d.)
 By 31 December 2023, the Group had successfully restructured 161 aircraft leases and was in discussions with 
lessors to restructure the remaining leases, seeking to waive the lease rentals in arrears and to reduce future lease 
rates while extending lease terms where appropriate. 
2.2 Standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations that are effective
 The Group and the Company have applied the following amendments for the first time for the financial year 
beginning on 1 January 2023:
 MFRS 101: Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendment to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2)
 MFRS 108: Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendment to MFRS 108)
 MFRS 17: Insurance Contracts - Initial Application of MFRS 17 and MFRS 9 - Comparative Information
 (Amendment to MFRS 17)
 MFRS 112: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction
 (Amendments to MFRS 112) 
 MFRS 112: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendment to MFRS 112)
 The adoption of these new amendments, standards and interpretations did not have any material effect on the 
financial performance or position of the Group and of the Company, except for:
 MFRS 101: Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendment to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2)
 The amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance and examples to help entities apply 
materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting 
policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their “significant” 
accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their “material” accounting policies and adding guidance on how 
entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.
 The amendments have had an impact on Group’s and the Company’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on 
the measurement, recognition or presentation of any 
items in the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.

2.3 Standards issued but not yet effective 
 The amendments, standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of 
the Group’s and of the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to 
adopt these amendments, standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. 
Description
Effective for
annual periods
beginning on
or after
MFRS 101: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to MFRS 101) 1 January 2024
MFRS 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to MFRS 16) 1 January 2024

MFRS 10 and MFRS 128: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate 
or Joint Venture (Amendments to MFRS 10 and MFRS 128) Deferred
 The directors expect that the adoption of the above amendments, standards and interpretations will have no 
material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application.
2.4  Basis of consolidation
2.4.1  Subsidiaries
 A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has all the following:
 Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:  
•  Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant 
activities of the investee)  
•  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee  
•  The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns  
 In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 
impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their 
carrying amounts is included in profit or loss.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.4  Basis of consolidation (cont’d.)
2.4.1  Subsidiaries (cont’d.)
 Generally, there is a presumption that a 
majority of voting rights results in control. To support this 
presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the 
Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, 
including:  
•  The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee
•  Rights arising from other contractual arrangements  
•  The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
 The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there 
are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when 
the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included 
in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group 
ceases to control the subsidiary.
 Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) are attributed to the equity 
holders of the parent of the Group 
and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies. All 
intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between 
members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
 A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity 
transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including 
goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components 
of equity, while any resultant gain or 
loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.4  Basis of consolidation (cont’d.)
2.4.1  Subsidiaries (cont’d.)
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured 
as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects 
whether to measure 
the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included in 
administrative expenses.
 The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include 
an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. 
The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, 
and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience 
to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is 
considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to 
continue producing outputs.
 When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate 
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and 
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in 
host contracts by the acquiree.
 Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at 
fair value at the 
acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent 
settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is 
a financial instrument and within the scope of MFRS 9 Financial Instruments, is measured at fair value with 
the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with MFRS 9. Other 
contingent consideration that is not within the scope of MFRS 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting 
date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

 Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and 
the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held over the net identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the 
aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the 
assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net 
assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
 After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, 
allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
 Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation within that 
unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances 
is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
2.4.2  Associates and joint ventures
 An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to 
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control 
over those policies.
 A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement 
have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control 
of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.4  Basis of consolidation (cont’d.)
2.4.2  Associates and joint ventures (cont’d.)
 The considerations made in determining significant influence or 
joint control are similar to those necessary to 
determine control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investment in its associate and joint venture are accounted 
for using the equity method.
 The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face 
of the statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-
controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.
 Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. 
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net asset 
of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint 
venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately. 
Thus, reversals of impairments may effectively include reversal of goodwill impairments. Impairments and 
reversals are presented within ‘Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture’ in the statement of profit 
or loss.
 The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate or 
joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, 
when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group 
recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
 The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face 
of the statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-
controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.
 The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the 
Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the 
Group.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.4  Basis of consolidation (cont’d.)
2.4.2  Associates and joint ventures (cont’d.)
 After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group 
determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is 
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between 
the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss 
within ‘Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture’ in the statement of profit or loss.
 Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group 
measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying 
amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value 
of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
2.4.3  Reverse acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business 
 At the time of reverse acquisition, the 
Group considers whether each reverse acquisition represents the 
reverse acquisition of a business or the reverse acquisition of an asset. Where the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed do not constitute a business as defined under MFRS 3, the transaction is accounted as an 
asset acquisition.
 In such cases, the Group identifies and recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired (including 
intangible assets) and liabilities assumed. The cost 
of acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable 
assets and liabilities based upon their relative fair value at the date of purchase, and no goodwill or deferred 
tax is recognised.
 The legal subsidiary is regarded as the accounting acquirer while the legal parent is regarded as the accounting 
acquiree. The accounting acquirer is deemed to have issued equity shares as purchase consideration for 
the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquiree using the accounting principles of MFRS 2. The fair 
value of issued equity shares is determined based on the market value of the accounting acquiree which is 
represented by the quoted and trade price of its shares right before the reverse acquisition. The difference 
between the purchase consideration and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
will be recognised in the income statement as acquisition cost arising from the reverse acquisition.

2.4  Basis of consolidation (cont’d.)
2.4.4  Internal reorganisation
 Acquisition of entities under an internal reorganisation scheme does not result in any change in economic 
substance. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Company is a continuation of the 
acquired entities and is accounted for as follows:
(a) The results of entities are presented as if the internal reorganisation occurred from the beginning of 
the earliest period presented in the financial statements;
(b) The Company will consolidate the assets and 
liabilities of the acquired entities at their pre-
combination carrying amounts. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new 
assets or liabilities, at the date of the internal reorganisation that would otherwise be done under the 
acquisition method; and
(c) No new goodwill is recognised as a result of the internal reorganisation. The only goodwill that is 
recognised is the existing goodwill relating to the combining entities. Any difference between the 
consideration paid/transferred and the equity acquired is reflected within equity as merger reserve 
or deficit.
2.5  Property, plant and equipment
 Property, plant and equipment except for freehold 
land are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment initially recognised includes 
its purchase price and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Costs also include borrowing 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (refer to 
accounting policy Note 2.19 on borrowing costs).  
 Where significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the 
Group recognises such parts in the carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as a replacement when 
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the parts will flow to the Group and the cost of the 
parts can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognised. All other repairs and 
maintenance are recognised as expenses in profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.5  Property, plant and equipment (cont’d.)
 Freehold land is not depreciated. Significant parts of other item of property, plant and equipment are depreciated 
separately over their estimated useful lives in accordance with the principle in MFRS 116 ‘Property, Plant and 
Equipment’. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line 
method to write-off the cost of the assets to their 
residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Aircraft
- engines, airframes and spare engines excluding service potential 25 years
- service potential of engines 8 years
- service potential of airframes 13 years
- service potential of spare engines 11 years
Aircraft spares 10 years
Aircraft fixtures and fittings Useful life of aircraft or remaining lease 
term of aircraft, whichever is shorter
Buildings 28.75 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Office equipment, furniture and fittings 5 years
Office renovation 5 years
Simulator equipment 25 years
Operating plant and ground equipment 5 years
In-flight equipment 5 years
Training equipment 5 years
 Service potential of 8 years represents the period over which the expected cost of the first major aircraft engine 
overhaul is depreciated. Subsequent to the engine overhaul, the actual cost incurred is capitalised and depreciated 
over the subsequent 8 years.
 Service potential of 13 years for airframes represents the period over which the expected cost of the first major 
airframe check is depreciated. Subsequent to the airframe check, the actual cost incurred is capitalised and 
depreciated over the subsequent 13 years.
 Assets not yet in operation are stated at cost and are not depreciated until the assets are ready for their intended 
use. Useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at the balance sheet date.
 Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date 
for equivalent aged assets and depreciation rates are adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.5  Property, plant and equipment (cont’d.)
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such an 
indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. 
A write down is made if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. See accounting policy Note 2.8 on 
impairment of non-financial assets.
 Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and are included 
in profit or loss.
 Deposits on aircraft purchase are recognised as deposits and subsequently included as part of the cost of the 
aircraft and are depreciated from the date that aircraft is ready for its intended use.
2.6  Intangible assets
2.6.1  Other intangible assets
 Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in 
a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial acquisition, intangible 
assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
 Intangible assets with finite useful lives are 
amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end.  Changes in the 
expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the 
asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated 
as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is 
recognised in profit or loss.  
 Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, 
or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either 
individually or at the cash generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of 
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life 
assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on 
a prospective basis. 
 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when 
the asset is derecognised. 
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.6  Intangible assets (cont’d.)
2.6.1  Other intangible assets (cont’d.)
(i) Research and development – internally developed software
 Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when incurred. Costs incurred on development 
projects (relating to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognised as 
intangible assets when the following criteria are fulfilled:
- it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or 
sale;
- management intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
- there is an ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
- it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic 
benefits;
- adequate technical, financial and other resources to 
complete the development and to use or 
sell the intangible asset are available; and,
- the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably 
measured.
 Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense 
when incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an 
asset in subsequent period.
 Capitalised development costs recognised as intangible assets are amortised from the point 
at which the asset is ready for use on a straight-line basis over its useful life which is between 
3 - 7 years.
(ii) Landing rights
 Landing rights relate to traffic rights and landing slots for destinations operated by the Group’s 
airline operating centres and are recorded at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Landing 
rights are allocated to CGUs and are not amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite 
useful life and are tested annually for impairment.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.7  Investment properties
 Investment properties is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and allowance for loss on impairment (if any).
 Depreciation of buildings classified as investment properties is calculated by reference to their costs on the 
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of 5 to 29 years, and included in determining income. No depreciation 
is provided on land and buildings under construction.
 On disposal of investment properties, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the period when the asset is derecognised.
2.8  Impairment of non-financial assets
 Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually, 
or as and when events or circumstances occur indicating that an impairment may exist. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of 
the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs 
of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for 
which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
(CGUs). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an 
impairment are reviewed for possible reversal at each reporting date.
 Any impairment loss is charged to profit or loss 
unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged to 
the revaluation surplus. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In respect of other assets, any subsequent 
increase in recoverable amount is recognised in profit or loss unless it reverses an impairment loss on a revalued 
asset in which case it is taken to revaluation surplus.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.9  Maintenance and overhaul
 Owned aircraft
 The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned aircraft 
is described in accounting policy Note 2.5 on property, plant and equipment.
 Leased aircraft
 Where the Group has a commitment to maintain aircraft held under operating leases, provision is made during the 
lease term for the rectification obligations contained within the lease agreements. The provisions are based on 
estimated future costs of major maintenance checks and one-off costs incurred at the end of the lease by making 
appropriate charges to the income statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated 
during the financial year.
2.10 Leases
 The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. 
 Group as a lessee
 The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases 
and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and ROU assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets. 
(i) ROU assets
 The Group recognises ROU assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying 
asset is available for use). ROU assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of ROU assets include 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before 
the commencement date less any lease incentives received. ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: 
Aircraft and spare engines 2 - 19 years
Land and building 2 - 20 years

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.10 Leases (cont’d.)
 Group as a lessee (cont’d.)
(i) ROU assets (cont’d.)
 If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the 
exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.
 The ROU assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to the accounting policies in Note 2.8 impairment of 
non-financial assets. 
(ii) Lease liabilities
 At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments 
(including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that 
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. 
 The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are 
recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event 
or condition that triggers the payment occurs.  
 In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because the 
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After 
the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and 
reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured 
if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a 
change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. Lease modifications that are not 
accounted for as separate leases are accounted as adjustments to the carrying value of the lease liability 
with a corresponding impact to the related right-of-use asset.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.10 Leases (cont’d.)
 Group as a lessee (cont’d.)
(iii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
 The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment 
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets 
are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
 Group as a lessor
 As a lessor, the Group determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To 
classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the 
risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee.
(i) Finance leases
 The Group classifies a lease as a finance lease if the lease 
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.
 The Group derecognises the underlying asset and recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the 
net investment in a finance lease.  Net investment in a finance lease is measured at an amount equal to 
the sum of the present value of lease payments from lessee and the unguaranteed residual value of the 
underlying asset. Initial direct costs are also included in the initial measurement of the net investment. The 
net investments is subject to MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (refer to Note 2.12.4) on impairment of financial 
assets. In addition, the Group reviews regularly the estimated unguaranteed residual value.
 Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method so as to reflect a 
constant periodic rate of return. The Group revises the lease income allocation if there is a reduction in the 
estimated unguaranteed residual value.

2.10 Leases (cont’d.)
 Group as a lessor (cont’d.)
(ii) Operating leases
 The Group classifies a lease as an operating lease if the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.
 The Group recognises lease payments received under operating lease as lease income on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
(iii) Sublease classification 
 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, 
it assesses the lease classification of a sublease with reference 
to the ROU asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is 
short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sublease 
as an operating lease.
 The Group as an intermediate lessor accounts for the sublease as follows:
- If the sublease is classified as an operating lease, 
the original lessee continues to account for the lease 
liability and ROU asset on the head lease.
- If the sublease is classified as a finance lease, the original lessee derecognises the ROU asset on the 
head lease at the sublease commencement date and continues to account for the original lease liability. 
The original lessee, as the sublessor, recognises a net investment in the sublease and evaluates it for 
impairment.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.11 Inventories
 Inventories which comprise consumables used internally for repairs and maintenance are stated at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value.
 Cost is determined on the weighted average basis, and comprises the purchase price and incidentals incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
 Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all applicable 
variable selling expenses. In arriving at net realisable value, due allowance is made for all damaged, obsolete and 
slow-moving items.
2.12 Financial assets
2.12.1 Initial recognition and measurement
 Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.
 The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash 
flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied 
the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are 
measured at the transaction price.
 In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal 
amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to 
as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. 
Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or 
loss, irrespective of the business model.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.12 Financial assets (cont’d.)
2.12.1 Initial recognition and measurement (cont’d.)
 The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in 
order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting 
contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at 
amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held 
within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.
 Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by 
regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the 
date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
2.12.2 Subsequent measurement
 For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
• Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);
•  Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt 
instruments);
• Financial assets designated at fair value through 
OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); or
• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair 
value with net changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity 
instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under MFRS 
132 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an 
instrument-by-instrument basis.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.12 Financial assets (cont’d.)
2.12.2 Subsequent measurement (cont’d.)
 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (cont’d.)
 Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised 
as other income in the statement of 
profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except 
when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in 
which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not 
subject to impairment assessment.
 The Group elected to classify irrevocably its non-listed equity investments under this category.
 Amortised costs 
 Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently 
measured using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) 
method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is 
derecognised, modified or impaired.
2.12.3 Derecognition
 A financial asset (or, where applicable, a 
part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) 
is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:
•  The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;
•  The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation 
to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ 
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, 
but has transferred control of the asset.
 When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its 
continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset 
and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has 
retained.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.12 Financial assets (cont’d.)
2.12.3 Derecognition (cont’d.)
 Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower 
of the original carrying amount of the 
asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could 
be required to repay.
2.12.4  Impairment 
 The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at 
fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due 
in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an 
approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the 
sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
 ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that 
are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses 
expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
 For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its 
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic 
environment.
 For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every 
reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using 
all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that 
evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group
 
considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual payments are more than 
30 days past due.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.12 Financial assets (cont’d.)
2.12.4 Impairment (cont’d.)
 The Group’s debt instruments at fair value 
through OCI comprise solely of quoted bonds that are graded in 
the top investment category (Very Good and Good) by the Good Credit Rating Agency and, therefore, are 
considered to be low credit risk investments. It is the Group’s policy to measure ECLs on such instruments 
on a 12-month basis. However, when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, 
the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL. The Group uses the ratings from the Good Credit Rating 
Agency both to determine whether the debt instrument has significantly increased in credit risk and to 
estimate ECLs.
 The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. 
However,in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or 
external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the 
outstanding contractual amounts in 
full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off 
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
2.13 Financial liabilities
2.13.1 Classification and measurement
 The Group classifies its financial liabilities in the following category: other financial liabilities. Management 
determines the classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition.
 The Group does not hold any financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss (except for 
derivative financial instruments). See accounting policy Note 2.15 on derivative financial instruments and 
hedging activities.
 Other financial liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial 
liabilities are initially recognised 
at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial liability 
and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Changes in the carrying 
value of these liabilities are recognised in the income statements.
 The Group’s other financial liabilities comprise payables (including intercompanies and related parties’ 
balances), borrowings and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position. Financial liabilities are 
classified as current liabilities; except for maturities 
greater than 12 months after the reporting date, in which 
case they are classified as non-current liabilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.12 Financial assets (cont’d.)
2.13.1 Classification and measurement (cont’d.)  
 Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is either discharged, cancelled, expired or has been 
restructured with substantially different terms.
 Derecognition 
 A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or 
expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially 
different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. 
2.14  Offsetting financial instruments
 Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, 
or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.15  Derivatives and hedge accounting
 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value.
 The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument, and the nature of the item being hedged. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are 
classified as held for trading and accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2.12. The 
Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or 
a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge).
 At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to 
which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.15  Derivatives and hedge accounting (cont’d.)
 The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk 
being hedged and how the Group will 
assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness 
requirements (including analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). 
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:
(a) There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
(b) The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship. 
(c) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged 
item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually 
uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.
 Designation of a risk component of a hedged item is permitted when it is a separable identifiable component of the 
item, and the changes in the cash flows or the fair value of the item attributable to changes in the risk component 
is reliably measured.
 The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 21. The full fair 
value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining hedged item is more 
than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 
months.
 Cash flow hedge
 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain 
or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement within ‘net fair value (loss)/gain on derivatives’ (Note 8(d)).

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.15  Derivatives and hedge accounting (cont’d.)
 Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit 
or loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective 
portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss and presented 
separately after net operating profit.
 When the forecast transaction that is hedged 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, 
inventory or property, plant and equipment), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred 
from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately 
recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory, or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and 
equipment.
 When a hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, 
any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast 
transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, 
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement within 
‘net fair value (loss)/gain on derivatives’ (Note 8(d)).
2.16  Cash and cash equivalents
 For the purpose of the statements of cash flow, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank balances, 
demand deposits and other short term, highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
less bank overdrafts. Deposits held as pledged securities for banking facilities granted to the Group are not included 
as cash and cash equivalents.
2.17  Provisions
 Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as 
a result of a past event, it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Where the Group 
and the Company expect a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but 
only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the 
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense in profit or loss. 
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.17  Provisions (cont’d.)
 Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed in the 
notes to consolidated financial statements, unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits is remote. Contingent assets are not recognised but disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial 
statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. If it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic 
benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
2.18  Redeemable Convertible Unsecured Islamic Debt Securities
 Redeemable convertible unsecured islamic debt securities (“”RCUIDS””) issued by the Company are separated into 
liability and equity components.
 On issuance of the RCUIDS, the fair 
value of the liability component is determined using a market rate for an 
equivalent non-convertible instrument.  The amount is classified as a financial liability measured at amortised cost 
(net of transaction costs) until it is extinguished on conversion or redemption.
 The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included in equity.  
Transaction costs are deducted from equity, net of associated income tax.  The carrying amount of the conversion 
option is not remeasured in subsequent years.
 Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the RCUIDS, based on the 
allocation of proceeds to the liability and equity components when the instruments are initially recognised.
2.19  Borrowings costs
 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the 
asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest 
and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
2.20 Current and deferred income tax
 The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case 
the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax 
charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period 
in the countries where the Group’s subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates operate and generate taxable income.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.20 Current and deferred income tax (cont’d.)
 Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected 
to be paid to the tax authorities. This 
liability is measured using the single best estimate of the most likely outcome.
 Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts 
attributed to assets and liabilities for tax 
purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, 
deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other 
than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits including unused investment tax 
allowance can be utilised.
 Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with  investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures or associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally the 
Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates and joint ventures. Only where 
there is an agreement in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference, 
a deferred tax liability is not recognised.
 Deferred and income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied 
by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention 
to settle the balances on a net basis.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.21 Employee benefits
2.21.1 Short term employee benefits
 Wages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the 
financial year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees of the Group.
2.21.2 Defined contribution retirement plan
 The Group’s contributions to the Employees’ Provident Fund are charged to income statement in the financial 
year to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further obligations. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future 
payments is available.
2.21.3 Defined benefit plan
 The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in Indonesia and Philippines, which require contributions 
to be made to separately administered funds. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan 
is determined using the projected unit credit method.
 Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in the statement 
of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in 
which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:
- The date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and
- The date that the Group recognises related restructuring costs.
 Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The 
Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under ‘staff costs’ in the 
income statements:
- Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments 
and non-routine settlements; and
- Net interest expense or income.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.21 Employee benefits (cont’d.)
2.21.4 Share-based payments
 Employees of the Company and certain subsidiary companies of the Group receive remuneration in the form 
of share options as consideration for services rendered.  The cost of these equity-settled transactions with 
employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options at the date of grant.  This cost is 
recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in the employee share option reserves over the 
vesting period.  The cumulative expense recognised 
at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects 
the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s and the Group’s best estimate of 
the number of share options that will ultimately vest.  The charge or credit to profit or loss for a period 
represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of the period. 
 No expense is recognised for share options that do not ultimately vest because market performance and/
or service conditions have not been met.  The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction 
costs and the employee share option reserve relating to the vested options are transferred to share capital 
when the share options are exercised.
2.22 Revenue and other income
 Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and exclude amounts 
collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when or as it transfers control over a product or 
service to customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of the asset.
2.22.1 Passenger revenue
 Passenger revenue relates to scheduled passenger flight and charter flight income and is recorded net 
of discounts and includes the related ancillary 
revenue (including airport and insurance surcharges, 
administrative fees, baggage fee, assigned seat, cancellation, documentation and other fees, and on-
board sale of meals and merchandise). The Group initially recognises all ticket sales as ‘sales in advance’ 
which is presented as current liabilities in line with MFRS 15. Passenger revenue is recorded when the air 
transportation service is provided (i.e. recognised at a point in time).
2.22.2 Aircraft operating leases
 Revenue from aircraft operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.22 Revenue and other income (cont’d.)
2.22.3 Freight services
 Freight revenue is a distinct performance obligation and recognised upon the completion of services 
rendered net of discounts.
2.22.4  Rental income and brand license
 Rental income and brand license fees are recognised on an accrual basis.
2.22.5  Interest income
 Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
2.22.6  Sale of loyalty points
 The Group operates a frequent flyer programme where members accumulate points for purchases made 
which entitle them to discounts on future purchases. Revenue from the award points is recognised as 
deferred revenue (included in trade and other payables) upon issuing the points, and recognised upon 
redemption of loyalty points by members. The amount of revenue recognised is computed based on the 
number of points redeemed and the redemption value of each point which is calculated on a weighted 
average basis. Award points issued 
before 1 June 2019 will expire by 36 months upon date of issuance 
and points issued after 1 June 2019 will expire 24 months upon date of issuance. Revenue associated with 
the sale of points to merchant partners under the customer loyalty programme is recognised when the 
obligation is completed. 
 Included in trade and other payables is the deferred breakage. Breakage represents the estimated loyalty 
points that are not expected to be redeemed by members. The amount of revenue recognised related to 
deferred breakage is based on the number of loyalty points redeemed in a period in relation to the total 
number expected to be redeemed, which factors in the Group estimate for the breakage. Breakage is 
estimated by management based on the terms and conditions of membership and historical accumulation 
and redemption patterns, as adjusted for changes to any terms and conditions that may affect members’ 
redemption practices.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.22 Revenue and other income (cont’d.)
2.22.7 Contract balances
 Trade receivables
 A receivable is recognised if an amount of consideration that is unconditional is due from the customer (i.e., 
only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). 
 Contract liabilities
 A contract liability is recognised if a payment is received or a payment is due (whichever is earlier) from 
a customer before the Group transfers the 
related goods or services. Contract liabilities are recognised 
as revenue when the Group performs under the contract (i.e., upon completion of services rendered to 
customer).
2.23 Foreign currencies
2.23.1 Functional and presentation currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company’s functional and presentation 
currency.
2.23.2 Transactions and balances
 Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional 
currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
 Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting date.
 Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with 
the exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment 
in a foreign operation. These are recognised in OCI until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, 
the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange 
differences on those monetary items are also recognised in OCI.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.23 Foreign currencies (cont’d.)
2.23.2 Transactions and balances (cont’d.)
 Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The 
gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the 
recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items 
whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, 
respectively).
 In determining the spot exchange rate to 
use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income 
(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognises the non-
monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple 
payments or receipts in advance, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of 
advance consideration.
2.23.3 Group companies
 On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into RM at the rate of exchange 
prevailing at the reporting date and their 
statements of profit or loss are translated at exchange rates 
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation 
are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular 
foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.
 Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on 
the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.
2.24  Segment reporting
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing 
performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Board of Directors that makes strategic decisions.

2.25  Maintenance reserve funds
 Maintenance reserve funds relate to payments made by the lessee for maintenance activities undertaken during 
the lease period. The Group will reimburse the lessee for agreed maintenance work done as and when incurred. 
The Group records the amounts received as maintenance reserve funds. At the expiry of the lease term, excess 
maintenance reserve is recognised in the profit and loss account.
2.26  Current versus non-current classification
 The Group presents assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position based on current/non-current 
classification. An asset is current when it is:
(i) expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
(ii) held primarily for the purpose of trading;
(iii) expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or
(iv) cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting period.
 All other assets are classified as non-current.
 A liability is current when:
(i) it is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
(ii) it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
(iii) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
(iv) there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
 The terms of the liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity 
instruments do not affect its classification.
 The Group classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
2.27  Fair value measurement
 The Group measures financial instruments such as derivatives, and non-financial assets, at fair value at each 
reporting date.
2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
2.27  Fair value measurement (cont’d.)
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
(i) In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
(ii) In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
 The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
 A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
 The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data 
are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of 
unobservable inputs.
 All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole:
(i) Level 1  :  Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
(ii) Level 2 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
  measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
(iii) Level 3 : Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
  measurement is unobservable.
 For assets and liabilities that are recognised 
in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group 
determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting 
period.
 For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of 
the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy, as explained 
above.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
 Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by the directors and are based on historical experience and other 
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, 
rarely equal the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are 
anticipated to have a material impact to the Group’s results and financial position are tested for sensitivity to changes in 
the underlying parameters. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are explained below.
3.1 Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets
 The Group is required to assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset 
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the 
entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. This 
requires an estimation of the value in use of the airline cash generating units.
 When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from 
the asset or cash generating unit and 
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. 
 There is a high degree of estimation 
uncertainty inherent in estimating the duration and severity of the economic 
downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pattern of expected recovery. As a result, the estimates 
and assumptions used in the cash flow projections which form the basis of the recoverable amounts attributable 
to the CGUs require significant judgement. These judgements require estimates to be made over areas including 
those relating to the timing of recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, future revenues, operating costs, growth rates, 
projected aircraft usage, aircraft capital expenditure, foreign exchange rates and discount rates.
 Further details of the carrying value, the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of property, plant 
and equipment and right-of-use assets are disclosed in Notes 11 and 31.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT’D.)
3.2 Impairment assessment of financial assets
 The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected 
loss allowance (“ECL”) for all receivables (including intercompanies and related parties’ balances). 
 The Group assesses the credit risk at each reporting date, whether there have been significant increases in credit 
risk since initial recognition. The impairment allowances for receivables are based on assumptions about risk of 
default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting inputs 
to the impairment calculation, based on the Group’s past history, existing market conditions as well as forward-
looking estimates specific to the debtors at the end of each reporting period.
3.3 Deferred tax assets
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which temporary differences can be utilised. Estimating the future taxable profits involves significant 
assumptions, especially in respect of regulatory approvals for prospective routes, aircraft delivery, fares, load 
factor, fuel price, maintenance costs and currency movements. These assumptions have been built based on 
expected 
future performance and taxable profits which have been adjusted for non-recurring circumstances and a 
reasonable growth rate.
3.4  Provision for aircraft maintenance and overhaul costs
 The Group operates aircraft which are either owned or held under operating lease arrangement. In respect of the 
aircraft held under operating lease arrangements, the Group is contractually obligated to maintain the aircraft 
during the lease period and to redeliver the aircraft 
to the lessors at the end of the lease term, in certain pre-agreed 
conditions. Accordingly, the Group estimates the aircraft maintenance costs required to fulfil these obligations at 
the end of the lease period and recognise a provision for these costs at each reporting date. 
 A provision by its nature is more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position. The estimates 
of the outcome and financial effects are determined by the judgement of the management, supplemented by 
experience from similar transactions.  Any revision in assumptions and estimations that causes a material effect to 
the provision would be adjusted prospectively in the financial statements.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONT’D.)
3.5  Impairment assessment of intangible assets
 Goodwill, landing rights and other indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually and at other times 
when such indicators exist. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which 
goodwill and landing rights are allocated.
 When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from 
the asset or cash generating unit and 
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those 
cash flows. Further details of the carrying value and the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of 
goodwill and landing rights are given in Note 17.
3.6  Impairment assessment of interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures
 The Group’s and the Company’s interests in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are tested for impairment 
by comparing the carrying amounts with the value in use. Estimating the value in use requires the Group and 
the Company to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the operation of the subsidiaries, the 
associates and the joint ventures, and to apply a suitable discount rate and growth rate in order to calculate the 
present value of those cash flows.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
10. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE
 Basic
 The basic earnings/(loss) per share for the financial year is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit/(loss) attributable to 
owners of the parent, divided by the weighted average number of shares, calculated as follows:
Group
 2023  2022 
Net profit/(loss) for the financial year attributable to owners of the parent (RM’000)  336,789  (3,238,029)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (‘000)  4,187,400  4,053,123 
Basic earnings/(loss) per share (sen)  8.0  (79.9)
 Diluted
 The diluted earnings/(loss) per share for the financial year is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit/(loss) attributable to 
owners of the parent, divided by the weighted average number of shares that would have been in issue upon full exercise 
of the options under the RCUIDS, warrants and ESOS granted, calculated as follows:
Group
 2023  2022 
Net profit/(loss) for the financial year attributable to owners of the parent (RM’000)  336,789  (3,238,029)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (‘000)  4,187,400  4,053,123 
Effect of conversion of RCUIDS (‘000)  942,827  1,035,611 
Effect of conversion of warrants (‘000)  649,670  649,675

 Landing rights
 Landing rights relate to traffic rights and landing slots for destinations operated by IAA, AAV and PAA. As explained in 
Note 2.6.1(ii), the useful life of these landing rights is estimated to be indefinite.
 Impairment testing for goodwill and landing rights
 The carrying amounts of goodwill and landing 
rights allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (“CGUs”) are as follows:

 2,168,759  273,466  2,430,840  443,900 
 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have 
been measured based on their value in use which is based on calculations 
using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year period. The discount 
rates applied to the cash flow projections and the forecasted growth rates used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the  
five-year period are as follows:
Growth rates Discount rates

AAV 1% - 13%  - 
Velox 1% 2% 15% 15%
17.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONT’D.)
 Impairment testing for goodwill and landing rights (cont’d.)
 The calculation of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:
Growth rates: The forecasted growth rate is based on published industry research and do not exceed the long term 
average growth rate for the industries relevant to the CGU.
Discount rates: Discount rate reflects management’s estimate of the risks specific to this entity. In determining 
appropriate discount rate, consideration has been given to the applicable weighted average cost of 
capital.
 The recoverable amount of the IAA, PAA, TAA, BIG and Velox CGU is within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The 
following table summarises the quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in level 3 fair value 
measurement:
Description Unobservable inputs* Inputs Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value
IAA Discount rate 18% Increased discount rate of 1% would decrease fair value by 
RM54,000,000
Long-term growth rate per annum 3% Decreased long-term growth rate by 1% would decrease 
the fair value by RM24,000,000
Velox Discount rate 15% Increased discount rate of 1% would decrease fair value by 
RM5,000,000
Long-term growth rate per annum 1% Decreased long-term growth rate by 1% would decrease 
the fair value by RM3,000,000
AAV Discount rate 13% Increased discount rate of 1% would decrease fair value by 
RM290,000,000
Long-term growth rate per annum 1% Decreased long-term growth rate by 1% would decrease 
the fair value by RM164,000,000
PAA Discount rate 18% Increased discount rate of 1% would decrease fair value by 
RM41,000,000
Long-term growth rate per annum 3% Decreased long-term growth rate by 1% would decrease 
the fair value by RM17,000,000
BIG Discount rate 18% Increased discount rate of 1% would decrease fair value by 
RM9,000,000
* There were no significant inter-relationships between unobservable inputs that materially affect the fair value.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
17.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONT’D.)
 Based on the assessments performed, there is no impairment of goodwill landing rights attributable to the CGUs. The 
management believes that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions disclosed above used to determine the 
CGUs’ recoverable amounts, including goodwill, would cause its carrying amounts to materially exceed its recoverable 
amounts.
 The calculation of recoverable amounts of the CGUs which have been measured based on their value in use as described 
above has been made based on conditions existing at 31 December 2023. There is a significant risk that the assumptions 
on revenue per passenger, load factor, discount rates and growth rate applied in the goodwill impairment assessment 
would need to be revised, depending on industry developments which may result in a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of the goodwill.
18.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS/(LIABILITIES)
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and when deferred taxes relate to the same tax authority. The following amounts, determined after 
appropriate offsetting, are shown in the statements of financial position:

 2022 
 RM’000 
Provisions and others  1,496,272  1,204,289

Unutilised investment tax allowances  4,729,037  2,876,050 
 11,258,778  10,375,605 
 The recognised deferred tax assets are able to be utilised against future taxable profits of the subsidiaries. The deferred tax 
assets in respect of the above items, which have not been recognised, arose from subsidiaries, as it is expected that it will 
not be utilised against future taxable profits.
 As disclosed in Note 3.3 in respect of critical accounting estimates and judgments, the deferred tax assets are recognised 
on the basis of the Group’s previous history of recording profits, and to the extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised. Estimating the future taxable profits involves 
significant assumptions, especially in respect of fares, load factor, fuel price, maintenance costs and currency movements. 
These assumptions have been built based on expected future performance 
and taxable profits which have been adjusted 
for non-recurring circumstances and a reasonable growth rate.

 The fair values of the floating rate borrowings approximate their carrying amounts, as the impact of discounting is 
not significant.
 The fair values of the fixed rate borrowings are based on cash flows discounted using borrowing rates that are 
reflective of the Group’s credit risk at the balance sheet date, at 2.90% to 13.50% (2022: 5.52% to 11.75%) per annum. 
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings are within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
31. LEASES (CONT’D.)
 Group as a lessee (cont’d.)
 In 2022, modifications represent change in lease terms and consideration of aircraft lease agreements from certain lessors. 
These modifications were negotiated by the Group to provide flexibility in managing the leased-asset portfolio and align 
with the Group’s business needs.
 Reversal of impairment for right-of-use assets
 In the previous financial year, the reversal of impairment loss amounting to RM552.3 million relates to certain right-of-use 
assets due to the recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was recognised in the income statement as other operating 
income.
 The recoverable amount of the ROU of RM12,383 million was derived using estimated value in use and determined at the 
level of the CGUs of the airline 
operating centres in the respective countries that the Group is operating in. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs have been measured based on cash flow projections approved by the management. The airline CGU 
comprise right-of-use assets and aircraft related property, plant and equipment.
 The discount rates applied to the cash flow projections averaged from 13.5%. The assumptions used to determine the 
recoverable amounts include revenue per passenger, load factor, fuel cost, passengers charges and growth rate which 
may change significantly depending on the recovery of the aviation industry in the respective countries, regionally and 
internationally.
 Group as a lessor - finance lease
 The Group has classified most of its aircraft subleases as finance leases because the sublease is for the whole of the 
remaining term of the head lease. During the financial year, the movement on the finance lease receivables are as follows:
 2023

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
34.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
 Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”)
 On 2 August 2021, the Company implemented a LTIS comprising an Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) and a 
Share Grant Scheme. The establishment of the LTIS, which involves up to 10% of the total number of issued shares of the 
Company at any point in time throughout the duration of the LTIS, is for the employees and directors of the Group who are 
eligible in accordance with the By-Laws governing the LTIS. The LTIS is administered by a committee appointed and duly 
authorised by the Board in accordance with the By-Laws.
 The LTIS will be in force for a period of six (6) years commencing from 2 August 2021 and may be extended for a further 
period of up to 4 years immediately from the expiry of the first six years.
 ESOS
 On 3 August 2021, the Company granted 159,400,000 share options (“ESOS”) pursuant to the LTIS to selected eligible 
employees and directors of the Group. The ESOS will be vested on a 3 year-cliff vesting, i.e. 100% will be vested on 31 
August 2024, subject to the Company’s share price performance. Employees must remain in service for a period of 3 years 
from the date of grant up to vesting date. The fair value of the ESOS is estimated at the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo 
simulation model blended with Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions on which the ESOS were 
granted. The model simulates the share price 
and takes into account historical and expected dividends, risk-free rate, and 
the share price volatility of the Company so as to predict the share performance.
 The exercise price of the ESOS is RM0.74 which is equal to the 5-day Volume-weighted average market price (“VWAP”) 
of the shares immediately preceding the date of the ESOS award, with a discount of not more than ten per cent (10%). The 
vesting period and exercise period of the 
ESOS will be limited to the duration that the LTIS is in force. There is no cash 
settlement alternatives for the employees. The Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these awards.
 The expense recognised for employee services received during the year are as follows:

 There were no cancellations or modifications to the award in 2023.

 Movements during the year
 The following table illustrates the number of, and movements in, ESOS during the year.
 2023

Outstanding at 1 January  126,200  151,600 
Forfeited during the year  (27,300)  (25,400)
Outstanding at 31 December  98,900  126,200 
 The fair value of options granted during the year was RM0.282. The exercise price for ESOS outstanding at the end of the 
financial year was RM0.7425.
 The following table list the inputs to the model used for the ESOS for the financial year ended 31 December 2021:
 Share options granted on 
 3 Aug 2021 
Fair value at the measurement date (RM)  0.282 
Expected volatility (%)  53.874 
Risk-free interest rate per annum (%)  2.242 
Expected life of ESOS (years)  6 
Model used
 Monte-Carlo blended with 
Black-Scholes 
 The expected life of the share options 
is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative 
of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative 
of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
35.  MERGER DEFICIT
 Group 
 2023 
 RM’000 
 2022 
 RM’000 
As at 1 January and 31 December  (5,507,594)  (5,507,594)
 On 16 April 2018, the Company completed the internal reorganisation. Consequently, the merger deficit represents the 
difference between the purchase consideration to acquire AAB and the share capital of AAB.
 Further, the Company has accounted for the acquisition of AAB Group as a continuation of the acquired entity. Therefore, 
the share capital of AAB is reflected as a merger reserve since the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

38.  SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reporting provided to the Board 
of Directors. On 27 January 2022, the shareholders have approved the change of the Company name to Capital A Berhad. 
The change of name offers a better reflection of the Group’s core business and its future undertakings in tandem with its 
rapid transformation as it has gone beyond its beginnings as an airline into a digital travel and lifestyle services group which 
continues to gain strong momentum. This structural change would help facilitate strong projected growth in the Group’s 
portfolio businesses. It will also set the tone of the Group as it expands into new horizons and allay concerns of being a 
group that was intrinsically an airline.
 Consequently, the segmental information provided to the Board of Directors of 
the Company had been improved to reflect 
the focus on portfolio of businesses. The comparative segmental information have been restated to reflect the current 
classification.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES
 The Group is exposed to market risk (including fuel price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group uses financial instruments such as fuel swaps, interest rate swaps and caps, and foreign currency 
forwards to mitigate its financial risks.
 The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial risk management for 
the Group. The management team then establishes detailed policies such as risk identification and measurement, exposure 
limits and risk management strategies. Financial risk management policies and procedures are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in the market condition and the Group’s activities.
 The Group also seeks to ensure that the financial resources that are available for the development of the Group’s businesses 
are constantly monitored and managed vis-a-vis its ongoing exposure to fuel price, interest rate, foreign currency, credit, 
liquidity and cash flow risks.
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows:
(a) Market risk
 Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters while optimising the 
return on risk.
(i) Interest rate risk
 Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
 Interest rate exposure arises from the Group’s floating rate borrowings and is managed by entering into 
derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used, as far as possible and where 
appropriate, to generate the desired fixed interest rate profile. Surplus funds are placed with reputable 
financial institutions.
 The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by entering into a number of immediate interest rate 
swap contracts and cross currency swap contracts 
that effectively converts its existing long-term floating 
rate debt facilities into fixed rate debt (Note 21). All swap positions were closed off by 31 December 2023.
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(a) Market risk (cont’d.)
(i) Interest rate risk (cont’d.)
 If interest rate on borrowings at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 had been 60 basis points higher 
or lower with all other variables held constant, the impact on the post-tax profits for the year and equity 
arising from the cash flow interest rate risk would be minimal when considered with the hedging of the 
floating rate loans (Note 21).
 If interest rate on borrowings at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 had been 60 basis points higher 
or lower with all other variables held constant, the impact on the post-tax profits for the financial year and 
equity, as a result of an increase 
or decrease in the interest expense on floating borrowings are tabulated 
below. The impact on posttax loss are as follows:
 2023  2022 
 Impact on post-tax loss  Impact on post-tax loss 
 +60bps 
 RM’000 
 -60bps 
 RM’000

 RM’000 
 -60bps 
 RM’000 
Increase/(decrease)  26,657  (26,657)  17,620  (17,620)
(ii) Foreign currency risk
 The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. These exposures are managed, to the extent 
possible, by natural hedges that arise when payments for foreign currency payables are matched against 
receivables denominated in the same foreign currency or whenever possible, by intragroup arrangements 
and settlements.
 The Group is exposed mainly to fluctuation in USD as lease payments and fuel cost are denominated in 
USD. Increase in USD rate versus RM will result in lower profitability and cause corresponding impact in 
cashflows.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(a) Market risk (cont’d.)
(ii) Foreign currency risk (cont’d.)
 As at 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group has not hedged any of its USD denominated borrowings.
 The Group’s currency exposure profile of financial instruments denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency is presented in the respective financial asset and financial liabilities notes.
(b) Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or a counter party to a financial 
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from 
customers, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets.
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risks or the risk of counterparties defaulting arises mainly from 
various deposits and bank balances, receivables, deposits for aircraft purchase and derivative financial instruments. 
As the Group and the 
Company do not hold collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risks is represented by the 
total carrying amount of these financial assets in the balance sheet. Prepayment for engine maintenance to the 
service provider are also deemed by the Group as having credit risk in the event counterparties do not fulfill the 
obligation.
 Credit risks are controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit risks 
are minimised by monitoring receivables regularly. In addition, credit risks are also controlled as majority of the 
Group’s deposits and bank balances and derivative financial instruments are placed or transacted with major 
financial institutions and reputable parties. The Directors are of the view that the possibility of non-performance 
by the majority of these financial institutions is remote on the basis of their financial strength and support of their 
respective governments.
 The Group generally has no concentration of credit risk arising from trade receivables.
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(c) Liquidity and cash flow risk
 The Group’s and the Company’s policy on 
liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient cash and cash 
equivalents and to have available funding through adequate amounts of committed credit facilities and credit lines 
for working capital requirements.
 The management will continue to monitor liquidity 
reserves and rolling cash flow forecasts throughout the year 
based on the measures put in place and also potential impact from events outside the Group’s control.
 The table below analyses the Group’s payables, non-derivative financial liabilities, gross-settled and net-settled 
derivative financial liabilities and the Company’s payables into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining 
period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table below are the 
contractual undiscounted cash flows.

41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(d) Capital risk management
 The Group’s and the Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s and the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
 In order to optimise the capital structure, or the capital allocation amongst the Group’s and the Company’s various 
businesses, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares, take on new debts or sell assets to reduce debt.
 The Group’s and the Company’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2019.
 Consistent with others in the industry, the Group and the Company monitors capital utilisation on the basis of the 
net gearing ratio. This net gearing ratio 
is calculated as net debts divided by total equity. Net debts are calculated 
as total borrowings (including “short-term and long-term borrowings” as shown in the Group’s and the Company’s 
balance sheet) add lease liabilities less deposit, cash and bank balances.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(e) Fair value measurement
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current assets, and trade and other liabilities 
approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 
The fair values of other classes of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in the respective notes to financial 
statements.
 Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy
 The Group’s financial instruments are measured in the statement of financial position at fair value. Disclosure of fair 
value measurements are by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
- Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);
- Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2);
- Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) 
(level 3).
 The following table presents the Group’s and Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.

Notes to the Financial Statements (cont’d.)
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023
41.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D.)
 The policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are as follows: (cont’d.)
(e) Fair value measurement (cont’d.)
 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are 
valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted 
prices are readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active 
market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on 
an on-going basis. These would include actively traded listed equities and actively exchange-traded derivatives.
 Where fair value is determined using unquoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar 
assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classified as Level 2. In cases where quoted prices are generally 
not available, the Group and Company then determine fair value based upon valuation techniques that use as inputs, 
market parameters including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority 
of valuation techniques employ only observable market data and so reliability of the fair value measurement is 
high. These would include certain bonds, government bonds, corporate debt securities, repurchase and reverse 
purchase agreements, loans, credit derivatives, certain issued notes and the Group’s and Company’s over the 
counter (“OTC”) derivatives. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:
• The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
based on observable yield curves;
• The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the 
balance sheet date, with the resulting value discounted back to present value;
• The fair value of fuel swap contracts is determined using forward fuel price at the balance sheet date, with 
the resulting value discounted back to present value.
 Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs). Such inputs are generally determined based on observable inputs of 
a similar nature, historical observations on the level of the input or other analytical techniques, including discounted 
cash flow projections.
42.  UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES
 The Group has set up Merah entities, special purpose companies (“SPC”) pursuant to aircraft related borrowings obtained 
from various financial institutions. Under the arrangement, the Group 
enters into an Aircraft Instalment Sale Agreement 
with the SPC, permitting the Group to possess and operate each of the Airbus A320 aircraft financed under the facility.
 The SPC are orphan trust companies in which the Group has no equity interest. The SPC do not incur any losses or earn 
any income during the financial year ended 
31 December 2023. The aircraft and the corresponding term loans and finance 
costs associated with the SPC have been recognised by the Group upon the purchase of the aircraft.
 The Group does not provide any financial support to the SPC or have any contractual obligation to make good the losses, 
if any.
 The details of the Merah entities are as follows:

44.  OTHER MATTERS
 Litigation involving AirAsia Digital Sdn Bhd, AirAsia Berhad, Big Pay Pte Ltd.
 On 18 November 2021, arbitration proceedings were commenced against AAB and AAD in the Singapore International 
Arbitration Centre. The claimants are seeking for a buyout of their shares in Big Pay Pte. Ltd. for an amount to be determined. 
The arbitration proceedings remain pending. The evidentiary hearing concluded on 13 October 2023, and an award is 
expected to be issued sometime in 2024. The solicitors are of the view that AAD and AAB have reasonable prospects of 
successfully defending the claim.
45.  SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
(i) Setting up Airasia Cambodia
 On 9 December 2022, the Group announced that AirAsia Aviation Group Limited (“AAGL”), the aviation arm of the 
Group, signed a Joint Venture (“JV”) agreement with Sivilai Asia to establish AirAsia Cambodia. On 3 April 2023,
