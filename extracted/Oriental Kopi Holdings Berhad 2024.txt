to the operations of its business among others including: the Enviro nmental Public Health Act 
1987 in relation to food establishment licences; the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene)

personal data collection and protection.
Please refer to Section 6.18.2.1 of this Prospectus for details of the joint venture in relation to 
Paradise Oriental, as well as Section 8.1.9 of this Prospectus in relation to the risks associated

6. 2 5 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE 
We recognise the importance of ensuring environmentally responsible operations, providing a 
conducive workplace for our employees and adopting a high standard of corporate governance in 
shaping our Group’s future growth and development. Our Group’s sustainability efforts are guided by 
our sustainability policy. We have implemented and are in the midst of implementing the following 
practices:
(i) Environmental
Our Group aims to integrate sustainable practices into our business operations to minimise our 
impact on the environment. The measures that we have taken or plan to take including the 
following:
(a) we are embracing recycling initiatives by gradually phasing out single - use plastics. 
Currently, we use recyclable and/or reusable packaging, such as paper food containers 
and packaging for takeaway and online sales. Additionally, we have introduced 
reusable bags for eligible customers to reduce reliance on single - use bags. We also 
encourage customers to bring their own containers and use recyclable and/or reusable 
bags. 
(b) we have actively participated in environmental campaigns and initiatives organised by 
mall management for our caf e s located in shopping malls such as Mid Valley Megamall 
and Pavilion Bukit Jalil Mall. Our cafe employees separate leftover food from customers 
and food waste from preparation, and deliver it to designated locations identified by the 
mall management, where it is converted into organic waste. The respective mall 
management treats this organic food waste to produce fertili s er.
(c) we recogni s e that a high concentration of oil and grease in wastewater accelerates the 
buildup of sullage in the drainage system, potentially leading to river pollution. When 
solid food is not separated during dishwashing, it is flushed down along with the 
sullage. T o comply with local authorities' requirements and reduce pollution, we have 
installed oil and grease (FOG) traps in all our caf e s. These traps help prevent sullage 
from clogging sewers and affecting the performance of sewage treatment systems.

(d) recycling used cooking oil safeguards against improper disposal, which could 
otherwise result in environmental pollution. Our caf e employees diligently collect the 
used cooking oil and arrange for its proper handling and repurposing, effectively 
reducing our environmental impact.
(ii) Social

and health risks at our workplace to create a healthy and productive environment. As part of 
our social initiatives and within our workplace, we are committed to:
(a) establishing a safe, healthy, and nurturing work environment for our employees ;

discrimination based on individual differences, discriminatory or sexual harassment,

characteristic ;
(d) upholding fundamental workers' rights by eradicating all forms of child labour and 
forced labour ;
(e) e mpowering our workforce by facilitating their personal development ; and

3. PERFORMANCE OF THE F&B SERVICES INDUSTRY 
• GDP measures the gross value added to the output of goods and services in a country or 
sector during a specified period. Real GDP is a measure of “real” changes in output over time, 
due to changes in the quantity of goods and services produced, rather than changes in their 
prices due to inflation or deflation.  Nominal GDP is the value without any adjustments.
• F&B services encompass activities relating to food services, catering services and 
beverage services. Be tween 2021 and 2023, the real GDP of F&B services grew at a CAGR 
of 11. 9 %. Growth in 2022 was in part due to the recovery in domestic demand following the 
reopening of economy, while growth in 202 3 was mainly attributed to the partial recovery 
in tourism spending (Source: Vital Factor analysis ) . Despite the growth, the real GDP of 
F&B services remained below its pre - COVID - 19 levels in 2019. In the first nine months of 
( 9M) 2024, the real GDP of F&B services continued to grow by 3. 7 % compared to 9M 2023

5. DEMAND DEPENDENCIES
5 .1 Economic conditions , household income and inflation
• The overall health of the economy has 
an impact on disposable income and 
consequently, the demand for both
F&B services and products . As the 
economy grows, employment levels 
and consumer confidence will 
increase, leading to higher levels of
household spending. In addition, 
growth in household income will drive 
discretionary spending, such as food
away from home, dining out at
restaurants or purchasing takeaway 
meals from F&B outlets.
• The real GDP of Malaysia is estimated 
to grow between 4. 8 % and 5. 3 % in 
2024, supported by robust domestic demand and recovery in exports (Source: Ministry of 
Finance (MOF)) . In 9M 2024, the real GDP of Malaysia grew by 5 .2% compared to 9M 2023,
mainly driven by higher household spending, improvement s in exports and stronger 
investment activities. (Source: DOSM and BNM ) .

• In terms of household income, the average monthly household disposable income 
experienced a CAGR of 1.7% between 2019 and 2022 , based on the latest available data
(Source: DOSM ) . This provides opportunities for operators involved in F&B services.
• Nevertheless, the inflation rate , as measured by the annual percentage change in the 
consumer price index (CPI), may weigh on consumer spending . Higher inflation rate reduces 
consumers’ purchasing power, which results in lower consumer confidence and decreased 
discretionary spending. 
• Between 2021 and 2023, the CPI of food and non - alcoholic beverages increased at a CAGR 
of 5.3% and 3.5% respectively. Within the food segment, the CPI of food away from home
increased at a higher CAGR of 6.7% compared to that of food at home , which increased at a 
CAGR of 4.4% , between 2021 and 2023.
5.2 Tourist arrivals
• Tourist arrivals can contribute to the demand 
for F&B services as they often seek out local 
cuisine and various dining experiences, 
especially in areas with high tourism activit ies .
• Between 2021 and 2023, the number of tourist 
arrivals in Malaysia experienced a CAGR of 
1144.7% due to the recovery in the tourism 
sector. This corresponded with the CAGR of 
1623.6% in tourist receipts during the same 
period. The reopening of China’s international 
borders provided further impetus to tourism 
activitiesin Malaysia (Source: BNM) . The 
recovery in tourism activities will support 
consumer - related sectors including F&B services .
• In 9M 2024, the number of tourist arrivals in Malaysia grew by 27.0% to 18.4 million tourists ,
compared to 9M 2023 . In terms of tourist receipts, there was a 50.8% growth to RM45.4 b illion

6. SUPPLY DEPENDENCIES
6.1 Cost of ingredients
• As an operator of cafe chain, the food ingredients used by Oriental Kopi Group include ,
among many others, fresh meat and seafood products, milk and other dairy products , and 
eggs . As such, t he cost of these ingredients will directly impact the overall cost of F&B 
services of Oriental Kopi Group as well as other operators of F&B services .
• Between 2021 and 2023, the CPI for meat, fish and other seafood , as well as milk , other 
dairy products and eggs experienced increases . Particularly, the segments of meat , as 
well as milk , other dairy products and eggs , noted higher CAGR of 7.0% and 6.3% 
respectively, compared to that of fish and other seafood which gre w at a CAGR of 2.7% 
during the period .
• In 2022, the prices of chicken and eggs increased mainly due to global supply disruptions 
caused by the Russia - Ukraine war, leading to high chicken feed costs . In response, the 
government of Malaysia implemented a price control scheme and subsidies for chicken 
and eggs from February 2022 onwards . Subsequently, t he price controls and subsidies on 
chicken were removed in November 2023 as prices stabilised .
• In addition, other measures introduced by the Government to stabilise prices include d ,
among others, the abolishment of the Approved Permit (AP) requirement for whole chicken 
and chicken parts on 18 May 2022 to allow the import of day - old chick or fertile eggs from 
New Zealand and Australia to ensure adequate replacement stocks for hens, and 
permitting the importation of chicken eggs from a new source country namely, Thailand.

• Oriental Kopi Group’s products and services include coffee beverages served in its cafes ,
as well as distribution and retail of consumer - branded packaged coffee . T he fluctuations 
in coffee bean prices will thus impact Oriental Kopi Group and other similar operators .
• In terms of global coffee bean prices, Arabica coffee beans experienced an upward trend
since January 2021 primarily attributed to the production shortfall in Brazil , before 
decreasing in the fourth quarter of 2022 amid expectations of an increase in production.

T he continued decline in the global 
price of Arabica coffee beans in 2023 
reflected favourable supply conditions 
in Brazi l and Colombia . In 2024, the 
global price of Arabica coffee beans 
has been increas ing to USD6.72 /kg in 
Novem ber 2024. This was mainly 
attributed to unfavourable weather 
conditions in Brazil which disrupted 
coffee bean production . (Source: Vital 
Factor analysis)
• As for Robusta coffee beans , the 
global price experienced a CAGR of 
15.1% between 2021 and 2023. The 
increas e in 2021 was mainly attributed to dry weather conditions and mobility restrictions 
imposed in Vietnam , which is a major Robusta coffee bean producer . After some 
fluctuations in 202 2, the global price of Robusta coffee beans further increased in 2023
due to a decline in Indonesia and Uganda’s production . In 2024, the global price of Robusta 
coffee beans has been increas in g to USD4.98/kg in November 2024. This was mainly 
attributed to supply shortfall s from Vietnam amid adverse weather conditions . (Source: 
Vital Factor analysis)
6.2 Labour cost and supply
• S alaries and wages typically 
represent a significant proportion of 
F&B services . Between 20 20 and 
2022 , being the latest available 
information, the average salary and 
wages paid per person engaged in the 
F&B services industry declined at a n
average annual rate of 2.8 % .
• Effective February 202 5 , the minimum 
monthly wage in Malaysia will 
increase from RM1, 5 00 to RM1, 7 00
for employers with 5 or more 
employees. For employers with fewer 
than 5 employees, the increase will 
take effect from August 202 5 onwards 
(Source: MOF ) . The expected increase in the minimum wage will result in higher 
operational cost s for F&B service operators .
• P olicies relating to the supply of foreign workers in Malaysia will also impact the availability 
of labour for F&B service operators . Since March 2023, there has been a freeze on foreign 
worker application s and approval s, which is still in effect as of the report date .

8.3 Barriers to entry
• The barriers to entry for the F&B services industry are low as demonstrated by the large 
number of operators amounting to 2 7 ,448 food premises registered with the Ministry of Health 
(MoH) of Malaysia, of which 2 3 ,681 were food outlet premises in Malaysia in 202 3 . Operators 
are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including requirements on proper 
food handling, storage, sanitation, registration of food premises with the MoH of Malaysi a, as 
well as other licensing requirements. The Halal certification from the Department of Islamic 
Development Malaysia (JAKIM) also serves as a barrier to entry for businesses targeting 
Muslim clientele. In addition, initial capital investment is also required for setting up various 
aspects of food premises, such as leasing suitable location s , renovation, and purchasing 
kitchen equipment. 
9. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS
Consideration factors
• Growth in the economic performance of Malaysia including its services industry, driven 
mainly by domestic demand, will provide opportunities for operators in the F&B services and 
distribution and retailing of consumer - branded packaged food in dustries. In 202 5 , the 
Malaysian economy is forecasted to grow between 4 .5 % to 5 .5 %, with the services sector 
forecas ted to grow by 5.5%. Growth in the Malaysian economy will be driven by resilient 
external sector and robust domestic demand. Nevertheless, domestic growth remains subject 
to downside risks from among others, escalation of geopolitical tensions, supply chain 
disruptions and volatility in financial market conditions . (Source: MOF )
• An improvement in household spending will also drive demand for F&B services and 
distribution and retailing of consumer - branded packaged food in dustries. In 202 5 , household 
spending is projected to expand at 5. 9 % compared to an estimated growth of 5.5 % in 202 4 .
Growth in 2024 h a s b e e n supported by higher disposable income arising from favourable 
domestic economic activities , continued improv e ments in labour market conditions and
targeted government assistance . (Source: BNM)
• The supply and demand conditions of the F&B services and distribution of consumer -
branded packaged food industries w ill continue to be impacted by inflation . In 202 5 , headline 
inflation is forecas ted to ra n g e between 2 .0 % and 3.5% . (Source: MOF )
• Government policies including subsidies and taxes , will impact the demand and supply 
dynamics of F&B industry . Subsidy rationalisation on food items and fuel , and removal of price 
controls may increase operational costs for F&B product and services , who may subsequently 
pass on the se cost s to consumers through higher prices .
• Further recovery in international travel will improve tourist arrival and spending in Malaysia,
which bodes well for operators in the F&B industry . In 2024, Tourism Malaysia targets 27.3 
million tourist arrivals and RM102.7 billion in tourism receipts . This will be driven by flight 
connectivity and government measures such as promotion al activities abroad and the 30 - day 
visa - free travel for nationals from China and India (Source s : Ministry of Tourism, Arts and 
Culture, Malaysia and BNM) .
• Price increases in key ingredients will affect menu offerings and profitability of F&B service 
operators , and distributors and retailers of consumer - branded packaged food s . Nevertheless,
some essential food items including sugar, wheat flour and cooking oil, are classified as 
controlled goods, where their prices are regulated.

8. RISK FACTORS 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROSPECTS OF OUR GROUP AS OUTLINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, 
YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS (WHICH MAY OCCUR 
EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION, AT THE SAME TIME OR AROUND THE SAME 
TIME) THAT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE . YOU 
SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS AND INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS SET OUT 
BELOW ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE YOU 
MAKE YOUR INVESTMENT DECISION.IF YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT AS TO THE IN FORMATION 
CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. 
8.1 RISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF OUR GROUP 
8.1.1 We are reliant on third - party suppliers to produce ingredients for our cafe operations and 
our brands of packaged food products
All of our F&B ingredients are sourced from third - party suppliers for our ready - to - cook and ready -
to - mix/blend food for our cafes, and ready - to - eat packaged foods . There is a risk that o ur third -
party suppliers may face disruptions including, among others, fire, flood , prolonged interruptions in 
the supply of water, power , and input materials, government containment measures and 
shutdowns due to non - compliance to regulatory matters or other matters , or ceasing of operations 
due to bankruptcy, legal actions or voluntary closure . Any one of the se events may cause 
disruptions in the supply of ingredients for our caf e operations and/or our brands of packaged foods 
and this may adversely affect our financial performance.
While we may have alternative third - party suppliers for other general F&B ingredients and 
consumable items, we rely on a limited number of third - party suppliers for our ready - to - cook, ready -
to - mix/blend and ready - to - eat products where one third - party supplier may be responsible for 
several menu items or products. As we own the recipes for all our F&B products, we are able to 
switch third - party suppliers , however it will take some time for us to select new third - party suppliers
as replacement s . The time taken to qualify new third - party suppliers as replacement s may cause 
temporary disruption s to our cafe operation s or sales of our brands of packaged foods. In addition, 
if the taste differ s from the original taste, we may lose some of our existing customers.
T here is no assurance that any disruptions in the supply of ready - to - cook and ready - to - mix/blend 
food for our cafes, and ready - to - eat packaged foods from third - party suppliers w ill not adversely 
affect our business operations and financial performance in the future.
8.1.2 We operate within the consumer industry , making our business susceptible to changes 
in consumer behaviour, trends, brand preferences a s well as negative actions
As a consumer - based product and service provider, we face the risks of negative actions and 
changes in consumer behaviour, trends, and brand preferences. The demand for F&B services 
is dependent on discretionary spending as all consumers have the option of eating at home.  As 
such, the sustainability and success of our business rely on our ability to consistently adapt to 
changing consumer behaviour, trends, and brand preferences, supported by our brand equity.
The performance of our business as a cafe chain operator require s us to take into consideration, 
among others, shifts in culinary trends such as international or local cuisine influences; dietary 
shifts such as preference towards plant- based foods or healthy ingredients; religious or cultural 
considerations; and food innovatio ns providing new or unique tastes or dining experiences.
In addition, branding plays an important role in consumer products and services. As such, the 
sustainability and growth of our business depend on continuously building our brand equity 
including awareness, loyalty, trust and image to retain existing and securing new customers. 
Building brand equity also includes enhancing and sustaining brand relevance in the minds of 
target customer groups as the brand matures over time.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
Consumer changes in behaviour, trends and brand preferences may al s o arise from tastes, 
influences from social media, social trends, health trends , food security , religious and 
environmental considerations. We are also vulnerable to negative publicity or actions stemming 
from factors such as consumer boycotts, dissemination of negative information, fake news, 
sabotage and/or issues regarding quality, hygiene, and food safety. A ny of these events , if they 
eventuate, may adversely affect our operation s and financial performance. 
In this regard, there is no assurance that the market reception of our products, services, and 
brands will remain positive and relevant. Failure to align our offerings with consumer 
requirements and expectations could potentially harm our reputation and impact the results of 
our operations and financial performance.
8.1.3 We may not be able to sustain the same level of growth rate and financial performance 
for our business in the future
Our revenue grew from RM5. 02 million in FYE 2021 to RM 277.28 million in FYE 202 4 ,
representing a CAGR of 280.89 %. Our gross profit grew from RM0.26 million in FYE 2021 to 
RM 82.79 million in FYE 202 4 , representing a CAGR of 586.40 % .  
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve similar growth rates and financial 
performance in the future due to internal and/or external factors. Some of the potential internal 
factors include, among others, the inability or delays in expand ing our cafe chain operations 
and distribution of our brands of packaged foods domestically and in foreign countries, 
operational and management issues, issues associated with our third - party suppliers , and 
quality of products and services. Potential external factors include, among others, economic, 
social, and regulatory conditions, competition, changes in consumer tastes, preferences, 
spending habits, and brand relevance, and deterioration of performances of the shopping mall,
commercial facilities and areas where our cafes are located.
8.1.4 Inflationary pressure or other cost increases may ne cessitate price increase s for our 
products and services which may adversely affect our business performance
As a consumer - based business, our products and services are subject to inflationary pressure 
which impacts our costs of goods and services, which we eventually will have to pass the 
increased costs to our customers to at least maintain our margins. Inflationary pressure may 
arise directly from the cost of goods such as all the food products and ingredients, and 
consumables as well as indirectly arising from the increase in, among others, utilities, fuel, 
logistics, rental and labour.
Between 2021 and 2023 , the consumer price index (“CPI ”) of food and non - alcoholic beverages 
increased at a CAGR of 5.3% and 3.5% respectively. Within the food segment, the CPI of food 
away from home increased at a higher CAGR of 6.7% compared to that of food at home, which 
increased at a CAGR of 4.4%, between 2021 and 2023. (Source: IMR Report)   
There is no certainty that we will be able to pass on increased costs due to inflation or any other 
factors, to our customers in future which may negatively impact our financial performance. 
Alternatively, if we pass all the increased costs to our customer s, we may lose some of our existing 
customers and attract fewer potential customers. If any of these situations occur, it may negatively 
affect our operations and financial performance.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
8.1.5 Our operations may be affected by adverse changes in the terms and conditions of our 
rental agreements, the performance of shopping malls and commercial areas, or the foot 
traffic where our cafes are located
As at the LPD, we have 1 6 cafes located in shopping malls, 2 cafes located in shop lots and 2 
cafes located in airport retail mall. For the FYE 202 4 , we operated 1 7 cafes, all of which 
individually contributed less than 10.00% of our total revenue for FYE 202 4 .
Any adverse changes in the conditions and performance of the overall shopping mall s and 
multi- tenanted buildings or facilities where our cafes are located including, among others, cease 
or disruption in operations, changes in tenancy mix, poor maintenance and declining foot traffic 
may negatively affect our cafe operations located in suc h premises. Similarly, for our shop lot 
cafes, changes in the general area such as increased traffic congestion which may discourage 
visitors to the area, significant loss of parking facilities, loss of main attractions and changes in 
tenancy mix in nearby shop lots may also affect the performance of our cafes located at shop 
lots in commercial areas.
Furthermore, as all of our cafes operate in rented premises, we are dependent on the respective 
landlords and are subject to rental rates and tenancy periods imposed by the respective 
landlords. Upon expiry of the rental agreement, landlords have the right to change the terms 
and conditions of the rental agreement including increases in rental rates or non - renewal of our 
rental agreements. In addition, we are subject to rental terms and conditions such as liquidated 
ascertained damages in the event of failu re to commence and/or complete fit - out works, or 
delay in commencement of our cafe operations as per period stipulated in the rental agreement. 
In the event of any unfavourable changes in the conditions of rental agreement , performance 
of shopping malls and commercial areas, or the foot traffic where our cafes are located , this 
may negatively affect our business operations and financial performance. 
For the Financial Years Under Review, the rental expenses for our cafes (comprising 
depreciation of ROU assets, variable lease payments and interest on lease liabilities) 
accounted for 8.87%, 8.37%, 11.24% , and 1 1.11% of our total revenue for FYE 2021, FYE 
2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 respectively. 
For the Financial Years under Review and up to the LPD, none of the shopping malls where 
our cafes are located has ceased operations or encountered material interruption s .
Nevertheless, moving forward, there is no assurance that there will not be any adverse changes 
in the terms and conditions of our rental agreement. In addition, there can be no assurance that 
there will be no adverse changes in the performance of the sho pping malls and commercial 
areas where our cafes are located which may adversely affec t our operations and financial 
performance.
8.1.6 Our business is exposed to product and public liability risks related to our products and 
the provision of food services in our cafes, as well as risks associated with legal matters, 
employment, consumer claims, and other dispute
We operate a chain of cafes offering F&B services, distribute our brands of packaged foods 
through resellers including wholesalers and retailers such as supermarkets, minimarkets, and 
health and beauty stores, as well as retail our brands of packaged foods through third - party e -
commerce platforms and our website and specialty store. We may be subject to various legal 
and other disputes arising from our business operations from time to time.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
As we are principally providing F&B services and distribution and retailing of our brands of 
packaged products, we may face product liability risks, which could subject us to various 
punitive actions such as legal actions by affected consumers, fines by regulatory bodies, 
product recall, temporary closure of cafes , or withdrawal of business licences or other 
certifications. Our product liability could arise from, among others, product contamination during 
manufacturing, processing or storage and handling of foods and ingredients, unintentional use 
of unsafe or banned ingredients, sabotage and product mislabelling. We may also be subject 
to consumer claims arising from unsatisfactory quality of our F&B services.
Notwithstanding that we practice quality standards at our cafe s , insist that our third- party 
suppliers comply with various quality, hygiene and food safety standards, and ensure as much 
as possible that our other third- party suppliers practice quality, hygiene and food safety 
standards, the occurrence of such product liability claims may negatively affect our market 
reputation, consumers’ trust in our brand, and our operational and financial performance.  
In addition, in the operation of our cafes and the distribution and retailing of our brands of 
packaged products, we may be subject to risks of food contamination, poor hygiene and food 
safety practices, which are inherent risks to operators within the F&B sector. In the event of any 
occurrences, this may result in an inspection of premises by the local authorities which may 
result in monetary fines, withdrawal of permits and/or directives to temporarily close operations 
for cleaning purposes. This would have an impact on our reputation as well as our financial 
performance.
For example, in September 2023, there was an inspection by the MOH at our KLIA 2 Retail Mall 
(arrival level) cafe which resulted in a temporary closure from 26 September 2023 to 30 
September 2023 of the affected cafe for cleaning purposes and compounds from the MOH of 
a total of RM2,750, due to, among others, deficiencies in maintaining food storage standards, 
and general cleanliness. The cafe recommenced operations on 1 October 2023. For our KLIA 
2 Retail Mall (departure level) caf e , we were issued compounds amounting to RM2,000 by MOH 
(in October 2023) and MPS (in September 2023) for among others, deficiencies in maintaining 
food storage standards and general cleanliness. 
We had upon occurrence of the above incidences promptly taken steps to clean and tidy up the 
cafe premises in accordance with the MOH’s and MPS’s requirements, as well as implemented 
more stringent controls across all our cafe s. Please see Section 6. 2 0 of this Prospectus for 
further details of the above incidences and the rectification and control measures implemented 
by our Group. Although the temporary closure of our KLIA2 Retail Mall (arrival level) cafe 
caused a temporary loss of business for five (5) days, we extended the operation hours for the 
KLIA 2 Retail Mall (departure level) cafe to address the revenue shortfall arising from the 
closure, we did not experience material impact to our business and financial performance 
arising from the incidences a bove.
In addition, there was an incident on 13 July 2024 where the Immigration Department inspected 
4 of our cafes in JohorBahru at The Mall, Mid V alley Southkey , Johor Bahru City Square Mall, 
AEON Mall Tebrau City and Taman Johor Jaya and a total of 145 foreign workers (including 65 
foreign workers that were employed by the Cleaning Service Provider ) were detained by the 
Immigration Department. After further investigation by the Immigration Department, the 
Cleaning Service Provider was compounded for providing 27 cleaning service foreign workers 
without valid pass. W e had, via our appointed solicitors for the Incident , received a confirmation 
letter from the Immig ration Department dated 28 August 2024 confirming there is no case 
against us and the investigation has been completed by the Enforcement Division of 
Immigration Department of Johor. There were no penalty and/or compound issued to our Group 
and we did not experience any material adverse impact on our Group’s business operations 
and financial conditions in relation to the Incident. Please refer to Section 6.19 of this 
Prospectus for further details on the Incident.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
As we operate cafes and retail stores, we are subject to the risk of public liability arising from 
our products, services and/or premises. We may face legal actions by consumers from, among 
others, negligence by our staff in serving our customers and/or co nditions of our premises that 
cause accidents that harm our customers. For the Financial Years Under Review, we have not 
been subjected to any claims from customers pertaining to accidents at our premises, except 
for a minor claim from a customer who fell at one of our cafes , which was covered by our 
insurance .
In the course of carrying out our brand advertising and marketing functions to gain increased 
brand awareness from consumers, we may also be subject to risks of legal claims arising from 
the contents of promotional advertisements (whether via print, electronic or social media) 
regarding our products or services, such as if such advertisements contain inaccurate 
information or claims, infringe third party copyright s or trademarks or information which require 
third party consents. For example, in 2023, we rec eived a letter from a third party requesting 
us to rectify an inaccurate representation of our products on our social media posting in 2023 
and for compensation towards alleged losses and damages suffered due to such 
representation. Arising therefrom, we h ave settled the compensation and have removed all 
such representations from our social media postings and third - party online e - commerce 
platforms as well as notified relevant third parties to do the same. 
Dispute resolution processes arising from any legal or other disputes arising from our business 
operations may be costly and time consuming. Due to the uncertainties of dispute resolution 
proceedings, we are also unable to guarantee that the outcome of any such dispute resolution 
will be in our favour. If the outcome of dispute resolution is against us, such negative outcome 
may affect our market reputation, consumers’trust in our brand, and our financial performance.  
We are unable to assure that such incidents/events will not arise in the future and that they will 
not materially and negatively affect our reputation, business operations and financial 
performance. Also, there is no assurance that any insurance compensati on will be adequate to 
cover all potential claims. Additionally, claims may result in an increase in our insurance 
premiums affecting our financial performance.
8.1.7 We are subject to operational risks including shortage of labour, disruptions in power 
supply and other adverse events which may cause interruptions to our business
We are subject to operational risks including but not limited to shortage of labour and disruptions 
of power supply which may cause interruptions to our business operations. 
We are dependent on labour for our day - to - day cafe operations, which includes service staff, 
kitchen personnel, cashiers and general workers. As a result, a stable workforce is crucial in 
ensuring our operations run smoothly. Our labour costs accounted for 17.81% (RM0.85 million), 
19.01% (RM6.26 million), 18.7 8 % (RM17.65 million) , and RM35.79 million (18.40%) of our total 
cost of sales for FYE 2021, FYE 2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 respectively. 
As at the LPD, we have a total of 921 employees for our cafe chain operations comprising 664
domestic employees and 25 7 foreign workers for our cafe operations. We may experience a 
shortage of workers from time to time due to various factors including, among others, changes in 
government policies and regulations on the supply of foreign labour such as a freeze on hiring 
foreign labour which is beyond our control, higher salaries and remuneration package from 
competing industries, and lack of domestic workers. In the event of a shortfall in the labour supply 
for our operations, and our inability to maintain a stable workforceby replacing or hiring new 
workers promptly, this would adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.  
Furthermore, in the event of a labour shortage, we may not be able to execute our expansion plans 
to open additional cafes effectively and promptly, which may adversely affect our future business 
growth and financial prospects.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
For the Financial Years Under Review and up to the LPD, we have not experienced any material 
shortage in labour supply as a result of the changes in government policies and regulations which 
affected our business operations.
The operation of our cafes including front - of - house dine - in area, POS system, and in - store retail 
of our brands of packaged foods, and back - of - house areas, which include the kitchen, chillers, 
freezers, and storage areas, as well as the operation of relevant equipment and appliances, are all 
dependent on a consistent power supply. In the event of prolonged power outage s or intermittent 
disruptions in power supply or other events such as bomb scares, fire, flood and pest infestations, 
they w ould adversely affect our business operations.  
For the Financial Years Under Review and up to the LPD, there were incidents of power outages 
in shopping malls in the Klang Valley and a bomb scare incident in a shopping mall in Johor, which 
affected our cafe operations for a few hours and up to a day.  Save as disclosed the said incidents, 
we have not encountered any material power interruptions or events that adversely affect our 
business operations and financial performance. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that our cafe 
operations may not encounter any disruptive events that may adversely affect our business 
operations and financial performance. 
8.1.8 Our recipes may be copied and this may result in loss of our competitive advantage or 
decrease in our m a rket share 
As with many F&B products, there is the risk that the recipes for our cafe and our brands of 
packaged food products may be copied. While taste is a personal preference, copying of our 
products may result in losing our competitive advantage as similar tasting products are 
available in the market from competitors. This may subsequently cause us to lose market share 
for such products.
W e engage third - party suppliers for our ready - to - eat, ready - to - mix/blend and ready - to - cook 
products. We also carry out product development and taste tests with some of these third - party 
suppliers . Although we have taken precautions where our third - party suppliers and some of our 
personnel only have part of the recipe, there is no assurance that copied products may not 
affect our operations and financial performance.
8.1.9 Our growth prospects may be limited if we are unable to effectively execute some of our 
business strategies and plans 
Our business strategies and plans are focused on leveraging our key strengths and capitalising 
on our core competencies in cafe chain operations in Malaysia. Part of our strategy is to expand 
our business through additional cafe s in Malaysia and also in foreign countries including 
Singapore. The expansion into foreign countries is either through joint ventures with local 
partners or franchising. Please refer to Section 6.18 of this Prospectus for further details on our 
business strategies and plans.
In this respect, we are subject to risks associated with our expansion into foreign countries, 
including, among others, the following: 
- delays in finalising and implementing joint - venture or franchising arrangements;
- long period to achieve profitability;
- regulatory and other industry impediments as the operation of cafe s and distribution of 
our brands of packaged food s are required to obtain the relevant licences and/or 
permits as well as comply with the hygiene and safety standards outlined by the 
relevant authorities in the foreign countries . These standards include, among others, 
training requirements for food handlers, cleanliness and hygiene requirement for food 
storage and preparation areas, as well as labelling requirements for our brands of 
packaged foods ;
- slow consumer acceptance due to unfamiliarity with the cuisine and brand;
- competition from other F&B service providers;

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
- socio - economic factors affecting patronage; and
- unable to secure good locations for the cafes.
In addition, we are subject to the risks associated with the joint - venture arrangement in 
Singapore including, among others, delays in implementation of the joint - venture or termination 
or cessation of the joint - venture arrangement, which may adversely aff ect the timing of 
implementation of our strategies and plans to expand into foreign countries .
Our domestic expansion to increase the number of cafes also faces risks including, among 
others, the following:
- cannibalism among our cafes in proximity to each other;
- poor patronage in new states due to, among others, lack of brand awareness;
- drop in product quality, unintended changes in tastes, poor customer service due to 
issues associated with, among others, central kitchen, logistics, shortage of labour and 
management as the business expands rapidly; and
- unable to secure good locations for the cafes .
The prospects and future growth of our business are also dependent on our ability to implement 
and execute our strategies and plans effectively and promptly. There is a risk that we may not 
be able to achieve the timing and objectives of our business strategies and plans due to factors, 
including, among others, if we are not able to secure desired locations for new cafe s, or if we 
are not able to secure sufficient funding and/or bank borrowings in addition to the IPO proceeds, 
limitations in human resources or experience in foreign countries, regulatory changes, and 
delays due to epidemics or pandemics in the future.
We cannot provide any assurance that any of our strategies and plans will be commercially 
successful or that the strategies and plans will be implemented in a way that aligns with our 
expectations for identifying and reducing operational and business risksassociated with our 
strategies and plans. In the event of any delays or failures in executing our strategies and plans 
effectively, our future business growth or expected financial performance may be adversely 
affected
8.1.10 Our business is dependent on our Managing Director, Executive Directors and Key 
Senior Management
Our business operations are dependent on the experience, knowledge and skills of our 
Managing Director, Executive Directors as well as Key Senior Management of our cafe chain 
operation s and distribution and retail of our brands of packaged food business. Our Managing 
Director , Dato’ Chan Jian Chern is responsible for the formulation of business strategies ,
including corporate plans, branding and marketing strategies, contributing to the growth of our 
Group . Our Executive Director , Chan Yen Min is responsible for overseeing finance, 
procurement, human resource and administration matters . Koay Song Leng , our Executive 
Director is responsible for overseeing cafe chain operations (including kitchen operations), 
warehousing and logistics management.
Our Managing Director and Executive Directors are supported by our Key Senior Management 
team including Goh Ting Keong, Ho Poh Chian, Debbie Liew Jing Yi, Chan Wei Jet and Koay 
Chor Leng. The loss of services of any one or more of our Managing Director, E xecutive 
Directors or Key Senior Management without any suitable and timely replacement may 
adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
8.1.11 We are exposed to the risk of pilferage from our cafe s
We operate cafe s where our staff handles food products and ingredients, consumables and 
cash. There is a risk of product and cash pilferage which may materially affect our financial 
performance. 
We have put in place various operational procedures and controls to minimise product and cash 
pilferages. Some of them include customers’ orders recorded in the POS system which allows 
us to carry out audits of food products and ingredients. Customers’ payments are also recorded 
through the issuance of bills and receipts through the POS system. This ensures that all 
customers’ payments recorded in the POS system are tallied with the actual cash received. 
The POS is connected to our head office and the sales data of each cafe is transmitted to the 
head office in real - time.
Notwithstanding our systems and procedures being put in place, there is no assurance that 
product and cash pilferage may not affect our financial performance.
In addition, while we have insurance to cover pilferages and theft from all our caf es as well as 
our warehouse, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to 
compensate us for all the loss es which may affect our financial performance. I f we make 
multiple insurance claims, our insurance premium may increase which will affect our financial 
performance. During the Financial Years Under Review and up to the LPD, we have not 
encountered any material pilferage or theft from our cafe s or warehouse.
8.1.12 Our business operations are subject to risks of security breaches, malfunction of our 
ICT systems or unintended human errors
Our cafe chain's operations rely on our ICT system, which is either hosted in the cloud or on -
site, to link our head office, cafes, and devices for point - of - sale, web and mobile platforms, 
online and mobile payment systems, sales order processing, finance and accounting, 
management of our cafe s , and customer loyalty and reward programmes. Our ICT system 
handles and stores sensitive data, including personal and company information. In this respect, 
we are exposed to the risks of security breaches, malfunctions, unavailability of third - party 
netwo rk se rvices and wilful or otherwise damage to our ICT system. In addition, security 
breaches including among others, eavesdropping, cyber - attacks, malicious codes, ransomware 
or other destructive or disruptive actions relating to our ICT system, properties or a ssets 
including software, hardware, communications and data storage equipment, and our online 
platform may adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.
In the event of any occurrence of security breaches or malfunction of our ICT system, it may 
render our system inoperable for some time or result in violation of applicable privacy laws, 
which could subject us to significant liabilities, losses or actions by regulators and legal suits, 
and it could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial 
performance. For the Financial Years Under Review and up to the LPD, we have not 
encountered any security breaches or malfunction of our ICT system. Nevertheless, there can 
be no assurance that we may not encounter security breaches, malfunction in our system, 
human errors and/or careless actions, any of which would adversely affect our reputation, 
business operations and financial performanc e.
8.1.13 There is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate
We maintain general insurance policies where relevant and practical, covering both our assets, 
employees as well as business operations with policy specifications and insured amounts which 
we believe are reasonable. As at the LPD, we have various insurance coverage including fire 
and fire consequential losses, product liability, public liability, and money insurance with a total 
coverage of RM 90.69 million .

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
If claims exceed the coverage of our general insurance policies, we may be liable for the 
shortfalls in the amounts claimed which may adversely affect us financially. Alternatively, if 
there are numerous and sizable insurance claims, it may affect our insurance premium thus 
negatively impacting our financial performance. For the Financial Years Under Review and up 
to the LPD, there has not been any material claim that has exceeded the amount covered by 
our general insurance policies. 
Although we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our assets, employees and 
business operations are adequately insured, there can be no assurance that our insurance 
would be adequate to compensate for the replacement costs of assets, claims from em ployees 
or the public, and any consequential losses.
8.1.14 Our business operations and financial performance may be affected by prolonged 
epidemics or pandemics
We face the risks of any prolonged epidemics or pandemics that may affect our business 
operations. The risks may include the temporary closure of our business operations and a drop 
in the patronage of our cafe s . All of these situations may adversely affect our business and 
financial performance.
The dine - in operations of our Oriental Kopi cafes were temporarily suspended following the 
implementation of various MCO s by the Government. During this period, customers were not 
allowed to dine in at any restaurant and we were only allowed to provide takeaway services for 
our walk - in customers or through food delivery platforms. This affected 2 of our cafes for dine -
in in Johor in FYE 2021.
8.2 RISKS RELATING TO OUR INDUSTRY
8.2.1 We are subject to the risk of competition from other F&B service provider s
Cafe chain operators compete against other operators who are involved in F&B services . Factors 
of competition include , among others, brand equity including awareness, loyalty , and positive 
image; menu offerings and innovations ; product tastes, quality and pricing; dine - in, takeaway and 
delivery services; cafe location accessibility and convenience; cafe internal layout, decoration and 
ambience ; and online presence and ease of ordering , payment and delivery .
Competition also arises from other similar format cafes as well as different format F&B services 
including hawker s, food courts, traditional and quick service restaurants , and online platforms
serving similar or different cuisine s and types of F&B. According to the IMR Report , in 202 3 , there 
were 2 7,448 food premises registered with the M O H, of which 2 3,681 were food outlet premises 
(Source: Vital Factor) .
In the event we are unable to remain competitive or unable to build on our competitive advantages 
and key strengths moving forward, our prospects and financial performance may be adversely 
affected.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
8.2.2 We are subject to economic, social, political and regulatory risks in the countries where we 
operate including Malaysia and other foreign countries where we intend to set up cafe chain 
operations
Our business is susceptible to adverse changes in the economic, social, political and regulatory 
conditions in Malaysia and foreign countries where we intend to set up cafes as well as 
distribute and retail our brands of packaged foods that may harm our business operations and 
financial performance. Among others, these changes may include the following: 
- changes in domestic and global situations including political leadership, geopolitical 
events, expropriation or nationalisation, deterioration of international bilateral 
relationships, trade sanctions, boycotts, and acts of terrorism, riots and wars;
- changes in domestic fiscal and monetary policies affecting interest rates, foreign 
investments, methods of taxation and tax policies; 
- emergence of new epidemics or pandemics; 
- changes in consumer trends and behaviour; 
- changes in social conditions such as inflation, unemployment rate and minimum wage; 
and
- others such as foreign worker levy, unemployment trends, inflation and other matters that 
may influence consumer and business confidence and spending.
As such, there can be no assurance that any adverse economic, social, political and regulatory 
developments which are beyond our control, will not materially affect our business operations 
and financial performance.
8.2.3 Coffee beans are subject to price fluctuation s as they are commodity traded items
Coffee beans are a crucial ingredient in our coffee powder, which is a key beverage offered at our 
cafes, as well as in the distribution and retail of our brands of packaged foods. We purchase coffee 
in the form of roasted and ground coffee powder for our cafe chain operations and instant coffee 
powder for our brands of packaged coffee. Depending on the recipes, o ur coffee blends mainly 
consist of R obusta beans , with smaller proportion s of A rabica and/or L iberica bean s .
Coffee beans are an agricultural commodity traded globally and subject to price fluctuation s
attributed to various factors including supply, demand, agricultural conditions such as pests , cost 
of fertilisers and weather, market inefficiencies and economic conditions. Any sustained price 
increases or negative price fluctuations will result in an increase in our input material costs for 
coffee beverages which may in turn have an impact on our financial performance if we are unable 
to pass on the increase s in the cost of our coffee powder promptly . T here can be no assurance 
that we will not experience any negative price fluctuation in the future.
8.3 RISKS RELATING TO INVESTING IN OUR SHARES 
8.3.1 There has been no prior market for our Shares  
Prior to our IPO, there has been no public market for our Shares. Hence, there is no assurance 
that upon Listing, an active market for our Shares will develop, or, if developed, that such market 
can be sustained. There is also no assurance as to the liquidity of any market that may develop 
for our Shares, the ability of holders to sell our Shares or the prices at which holders would be 
able to sell our Shares.
The IPO Price was determined after taking into consideration various factors including but not 
limited to our business strategies and our financial and operating history. 
There can be no assurance that the IPO Price will correspond to the price at which our Shares 
will trade on the ACE Market upon our Listing and the market price of our Shares will not decline 
below the I PO Price.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
8.3.2 Our Share price and trading volume may be volatile
The performance of Bursa Securities is very much dependent on external factors such as the 
performance of the regional and world bourses and the inflow or outflow of foreign funds. 
Sentiment is also largely driven by internal factors such as economic and political conditions of 
the country as well as the growth potential of the various sectors of the economy. These factors 
invariably contribute to the volatility of trading volumes witnessed on Bursa Securities, thus 
adding risks to the market price of our l isted Shares. 
In addition, the market price of our Shares may be highly volatile and could fluctuate 
significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are 
beyond our control:
(i) material variations in our financial results and operations;
(ii) success or failure in our management in implementing future plans, business and 
growth strategies;
(iii) gain or loss of an important business relationship;
(iv) changes in securities analysts’ recommendations, perceptions or estimates of our 
financial performance;
(v) changes in conditions affecting the industry, the prevailing global and local economic 
conditions or stock market sentiments or other events or factors;
(vi) natural disasters, health epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases;
(vii) additions or departures of key senior management;
(viii) fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes; 
(ix) involvement in claims, litigation , arbitration or other form of dispute resolution ;
(x) changes in government policy, legislation or regulation; and/or
(xi) g eneral operation and business risks.
8.3.3 Our Promoters will be able to exert significant influence over our Company as they will 
continue to hold majority of our Shares after the IPO
As disclosed in Section 5.1 of this Prospectus, our Promoters will collectively hold in aggregate 
73.35% of our enlarged number of issued shares through United Gomax upon Listing. As a 
result, they will be able to, in the foreseeable future, effectively control the business direction 
and management of our Group as well as having voting control over our Group and as such, 
will likely influence the outcome of certain matters requiring the vote of our shareholders, unless 
they are required to abstain from voting either by law and/or by the relevant guidelines o r
regulations.
For instance, if our Promoters vote in favour of ordinary resolutions which require a simple 
majority approval, their vote will result in the ordinary resolutions being passed. If our Promoters 
vote in favour of special resolutions which require a majority of at least 75% shareholders’ 
approval, they will be able to influence the passing and approval of these resolutions at a 
general meeting. Conversely, if our Promoters vote against such resolutions, such resolutions 
would not be able to be passed.

8. RISK FACTORS (Cont’d)
8.3.4 There may be a potential delay to or cancellation of our Listing 
The occurrence of any one (1) or more of the following events, which is not exhaustive, may 
cause a delay in or cancellation of our Listing:
(i) o ur Sole Underwriter exercising their rights pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to 
discharge themselves from its obligations thereunder; 
(ii) the revocation of approvals from the relevant authorities for the Listing and/or admission 
for whatever reason; or
(iii) w e are unable to meet the public shareholding spread requirement of the Listing 
Requirements, i.e. at least 25% of our issued share capital for which listing is sought 
must be held by a minimum number of 200 public shareholders holding not less than 
100 Shares each at the point of our Listing.
Where prior to the issuance and allotment of our IPO Shares:
(a) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245( 1 ) of the CMSA, the applications 
shall be deemed to be withdrawn and cancelled and our Company and the Offerors ,
shall repay all monies paid in respect of the applications for our IPO Shares within 14 
days of the stop order, failing which the Company and Offerors shall be liable to return 
such monies with interest at the rate of 10% per annum or at such other rate as may 
be specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(a) of the CMSA ; or
(b) our Listing is aborted, investors will not receive any of our IPO Shares, all monies paid 
in respect of all applications for our IPO Shares will be refunded free of interest.
Where subsequent to the allotment and issuance of our IPO Shares:
(1) the SC issues a stop order pursuant to Section 245(1) of the CMSA , any issue of our 
IPO Shares shall be deemed to be void and all monies received from the applicants 
shall be forthwith repaid and if any such money is not repaid within 14 days of the date 
of service of the stop order, the Company and Offerors shall be liable to return such 
monies with interest at the rate of 10% per annum or at such other rate as may be 
specified by the SC pursuant to Section 245(7)(b) of the CMSA ; or
(2) our Listing is aborted other than pursuant to a stop order by the SC, a return of monies 
to our shareholders could only be achieved by way of a cancellation of share capital as 
provided under the Act and its related rules. Such cancellation can be implemented by 
either :
(a) the sanction of our shareholders by special resolution in a general meeting, 
consent by our creditors (unless dispensation with such consent has been 
granted by the High Court of Malaya) and the confirmation of the High Court of 
Malaya, in which case there can be no assurance that such monies can be 
returned within a short period of time or at all under such circumstances ; or
(b) the sanction of our shareholders by special resolution in a general meeting 
supported by a solvency statement from the directors.

10. CONFLICT OF INTEREST (Cont’d)
 
The Board is of the view that the involvement and interests of the Managing Director and Executive Directors in Beutea Compan ies would 
not affect their contribution and performance in our Group. In addition, the Managing Director and Executive Directors’ i nvolvement does 
not give rise to any existing and potential conflict of interest situation due to the following reasons: 
(a) though our Group’s business and Beutea Beverage Business operate within the F&B industry, Beutea Beverage Business which 
focuses on retail sale of tea drinks and snacks, may be distinguished with our Group’s business of cafe chain operations as well as 
the distribution and retail of own brands of packaged foods. Our Group's cafe F&B services are focused on local cuisines servicing the 
mass markets, while our brands of packaged foods are sold through its cafes, specialty retail store and third party e - commer ce platforms 
and distributed to resellers who are wholesalers and retailers such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, minimarkets, and health and beauty 
stores. Due to the different product s and services offerings of our Group’s cafe chain operations as well as our brands of packaged 
foods, as compared to the Beutea Beverage Business which focuses mainly on retail sale of tea drinks and snacks, the target c ustomers 
of both businesses would differ depending on their preference;
(b) the Executive Directors and Promoters in particular Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min and Koay Song Leng, as well as the 
CFO, Goh Ting Keong, are not involved in the day - to - day management of the Beutea Companies and these companies have their 
own management teams to undertake their respective day - to - day management and operations; 
(c) Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min, Koay Song Leng and Goh Ting Keong’s involvement in the Beutea Companies are for 
investment purposes only which do not create a conflict with our Group’s business or operations; 
(d) Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min and Koay Song Leng will abstain from deliberation and voting on resolutions in their 
respective capacity(ies) as Director or shareholder of our Group pertaining to any transactions between our Group and the Beu tea 
Companies , if any; 
(e) Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min and Koay Song Leng have provided Oriental Kopi with an undertaking that they shall not, 
and shall ensure and procure that partnerships or companies which they are partners or directors or shareholders of, shall no t in 
any way enter into any contracts, arrangements and undertakings or engage in any business that may give rise to a potential 
conflict of interest or which is in competition whether directly or indirectly with our Group;
(f) the respective directors of the Beutea Companies have also provided Oriental Kopi with an undertaking that for so long as the y are 
directors of the Beutea Companies and any other new companies to be incorporated for operating the Beutea Beverage Business, 
that they shall ensure and procure that partnerships or companies which they are partners or directors or shareholders of, shall not 
in any way enter into any contracts, arrangements and undertakings or engage in any business that may give rise to a potent ial 
conflict of interest or which is in competition whether directly or indirectly with our Group ; and
(g) the respective common shareholders of our Group and the Beutea Companies (other than Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min 
and Koay Song Leng), namely Goh Ting Keong, Wong Ai Kuen, and Wong Kang Xian, have also provided Oriental Kopi with an 
undertaking that for so long as they are shareholders of our Group:

i. that they shall ensure and procure that partnerships or companies which they are partners or directors or shareholders of, 
shall not in any way enter into any contracts, arrangements and undertakings or engage in any business that may give rise to a potential conflict of interest or which is in competition whether directly or indirectly with our Group; and 
ii. where required under law, they shall abstain from deliberating and/or voting on resolutions in their capacity as shareholdersof our Group pertaining to any transactions between our Groupand the Beutea Companies.  
In addition to the above, several of our Independent Non - Executive Directors below are /were involved in the F&B industry as follows :
(1) Tengku Hishammuddin Zaizi, our Independent Non - Executive Chairman is a director of several companies of the iKHASAS group 
of companies, which is principally a property developer and also involved in the operations of single standalone F&B outlets (Japanese, Korean, steamboat, English breakfast cafe restaurants and family karaoke). As at the LPD, Tengku Hishammuddin 
Zaizi has resigned as a director from the companies of the iKHASAS group involved in F&B operations ; and
(2) Datin Gan Kok Ling, our Independent Non - Executive Director is a director and shareholder of an investment holding company, 
Famous Five Ventures Sdn Bhd, which holds investments via shares in a standalone fine dining restaurant/bar business. 
The Board is of the view that the involvement and interests of our Independent Non - Executive Directors above does not give rise to any 
existing and potential conflict of interest situation as they are not involved in the day - to - day operations and management of these companies 
and the F&B product and offerings of these st andalone F&B outlets are different from our Group’s cafe chain operations providing F&B 
services.
O ur Audit and Risk Management Committee will supervise any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest situations and review our 
Group ’s current and future related party transactions and ensure that such transactions will be carried out on an arm’s length basis and on 
commercial terms that are not detrimental and are in the best interest of our Group. 
Notwithstanding the above, the interests that are held by our Directors and /or substantial shareholders and the interests that may be held 
by our Directors and /or substantial shareholders in the future in other businesses or corporations which carry on a similar trade as that of 
our Group or which are our customers or suppliers may give rise to a conflict of interest situation within our business. Where such interests 
give rise to a conflict of interest situation, our Directors and /or substantial shareholders and persons connected to them shall abstain from 
deliberating and voting on the resolutions relating to these matters or transactions that require the approval of our shareho lders in respect 
of their direct or indirect interests. Such transactions will be carried out on arm’s length basis and on normal commercial terms. 
Our Group will also seek such relevant shareholders’ approval where required. We will also make disclosures in our annual report of the 
aggregate value of any recurrent related party transactions to be entered into by us (where required) based on the nature of the transa ctions 
made, names of the related parties involved and their relationship with our Group.

(iii) Others
We are also involved in the trading of materials, consumables and equipment . In 
April 2024, we ceased the trading operation s .
For the FYE 2021, FYE 2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 , the cafe chain operation s
segment was our largest revenue contributor which accounted for more than 90.00% of 
our total revenue and followed by our distribution and retail of packaged foods which 
accounted for 1.04%, 1.01% , 2.26% and 4.1 6 % of our total revenue for FYE 2021, FYE 
2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 respectively. In addition, a small proportion of our revenue 
w as derived from trading of materials, consumables and equipment, which contributed 
3.00% or less of our total revenue for the Financial Years Under Review. 
During the Financial Years Under Review , our revenue wa s derived entirely from local 
market.

packaged foods are recognised at the point in time when the control of our products has 
been transferred, being when our customers are served with the F&B and upon accepting 
the delivery of the goods.
Our revenue is mainly driven by the following key factors:
(i)the extensive of our cafe chain operations network and presence ;
(ii) the number of distribution points and range of our brands of packaged foods 
offering s ;
(iii) the ability to continuously develop recipes and menu offerings and adapting to 
consumer changes in the culinary trends and dining experiences which may affect 
the market demand for our products and services ; and

the selling price and sales of our products and services .

further business expansion and growth.
 
Despite the increase in overall GP, o ur overall GP margin decreased from 32.28 % in the 
FYE 2022 to 29.39 % in the FYE 2023 mainly due to the following:
(i) increase in the cost of purchase for our overall material costs such as ingredients 
for cooking, beverage ingredients and packaging material s due to general rising 
food prices as a result of global food inflation ; and
(ii) increase in labour costs mainly due to :
• enforcement of the maximum working hours reduced from 48 to 45 hours

more than RM2.50 million.
Our effective tax rate for FYE 2023 was 2 7.07 % which was 3 .07 % more than the statutory

Commentary:
Comparison between FYE 2021 and FYE 2022
Our Group recorded a LBT and LAT of RM0.48 million and RM0.49 million, respectively, 
in FYE 2021, which was mainly due to the following:
(i) lower revenue generated during various phases of MCO s . Despite this, the fixed 
cost such as rental, labour cost continued to incur. Our Group did not exercise 
retrenchment during these periods ; and
(ii) pre - operating expenses such as renovation, interior design expenses, purchase 
of fittings and equipment, incurred for our new cafes at The Mall, Mid Valley 
Southkey which started operations in May 2021 and Bandar Puteri Puchong which 
started operations in November 2021. 
For the FYE 2022 , our Group recorded a PBT of RM 12.39 million (FYE 2021 : LBT of 
RM 0.48 million) and a PAT of RM 9.56 million (FYE 2021 : LAT of RM 0.49 million) . The 
turnaround for the FYE 2022 to PBT and PAT was mainly attributed to the expansion of 
our cafe chain operations in which our Group recorded an increase in revenue and GP .
Correspondingly, upon achieving operation al efficiency in the FYE 2022, our Group was 
able to cover its fixed administrative and operating expenses and thus resulting in a PBT 
margin of 25.48% (FYE 2021: LBT margin of 9.51%) and PAT margin of 19.65% (FYE 
2021: LAT margin of 9.76%) .
Comparison between FYE 2022 and FYE 2023
For the FYE 2023 , our Group recorded an increase in PBT by RM15.07 million or 121.63% 
to RM27.46 million (FYE 2022: RM12.39 million) and an increase in PAT by RM10.47 
million or 109.52% to RM20.03 million (FYE 2022: RM9.56 million). The increase in both 
PBT and PAT was attributed to the increase in the GP upon further expansion and growth 
of our cafe chain operations as well as the distribution and retail of packaged foods.
Notwithstanding , our PBT margin decreased from 25.4 8 % in the FYE 2022 to 2 0 .65% in 
the FYE 2023 mainly due to the following:
(i) decrease in GP margin as a result of increase in cost of sale s; 
(ii) increase in overall administrative and operat ing expenses, including selling and 
distribution expenses and administrative expenses, to support our Group’s 
continuous business expansion and growth during the FYE 2023 ; and

Correspondingly, our PAT margin also decreased from 19.65% in the FYE 2022 to 15.06% 
in the FYE 2023 coupled with higher effective tax rate recorded during the financial year .
Comparison between FYE 2023 and FYE 202 4

million or 1 15. 33% to RM 43. 13 million (FYE 202 3 : RM 20 .03 million). The increase in both 
PBT and PAT was attributed to the increase in the GP upon further expansion and growth 
of our cafe chain operations as well as the distribution and retail of packaged foods.
Correspondingly, our Group ’s PBT margin increased marginally from 20.65% in FYE 2023 
to 20.75% in FYE 2024. Our Group’s PAT margin also increased marginally from 15.06% 
in FYE 2023 to 15.56% in FYE 2024. The improvement in the PBT margin and PAT margin 
was mainly due to the improvement in the GP margin as a result of higher contribution 
from sales of packaged foods .

dependent on discretionary spending , consumer behaviour, tastes, trends , preferences
and brand relevance . Consumer changes in behaviour, trends, preferences and brand 
relevance may arise from shift in culinary trends , dietary shifts , influences from social 
media, health, food security and religious considerations. Negative actions include, among 
others, consumer boycotts, publishing of negative information, fake news, and sabotage ,
will also adversely affect our operations and financial performance . Hence , any change in 
consumer behaviour, trends and preferences and our brand relevance may affect our 
results of operation and financial performance. Please refer to Section 8.1 .2 of this

number of cafe s we operate. Our cafe chain operations is the largest contributor to our 
revenue, which accounted for 98.66%, 98.90% , 94.78% and 94.08 % of our total revenue 
for FYE 2021, FYE 2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 respectively . As at the LPD, we have 
a total of 1 9 cafe s in Malaysia located mainly in shopping malls, as well as shop lots and

operations in Malaysia by setting up new cafe s in various states in Malaysia . We plan to 
add 1 4 more owned - operated cafe s progressively between 2024 to 202 6 to our existing 
number of cafe s . In addition, we also plan to scale our cafe chain operations by introducing 
our Oriental Kopi cafes in selected foreign countries. This will increase our geographic 
presence and revenue base to include foreign countries, which will serve as additional 
drivers of growth an d geographic diversity to mitigate reliance on one country of operation. 
As at the LPD, we have 1 jointly owned and operated cafe in Singapo re, which is 
established through a joint venture with Paradise Group. Please refer to Section 6.18 of 
this Prospectus for further information on our business strategies and plans.
In tandem with the business expansion and growth of our cafe chain operations, our cost 
of sales which include material costs, labour costs and overhead costs such as rental s
and related expenses, selling and distribution expenses as well as administrative 
expenses such as staff costs and utilities expenses will also increase accordingly. 
Nevertheless, if our business strategies and plans can be successfully implemented, it is 
expected to improve our operational efficiency and thus contributing to improveme nt in 
profit margins. In the event of any delays or failures in executing our business strategies 
and plans effectively, our future business expansion and cafe chain operations growth or 
expected financial performance may be adversely affected. 
(c) Impact of inflationary pressure or price fluctuation in material costs 
Material costs for our F&B services which include ingredients for cooking , beverage 
ingredients and finished goods for our packaged foods constituted the largest component 
in our cost of sales which accounted for 56.55%, 60.13% , 55.79% and 56.45% of our total 
cost of sales for the FYE 2021, FYE 2022 , FYE 2023 and FYE 2024 , respectively.

which impact our cost of goods and services. There is no certainty that we will be able to 
pass on increased costs due to inflation or any other factors, to our customers in future which 
may affect our profit margins and thus negatively impact our financial performance.

existing customers and attract fewer potential customers. If any of these situations occur, it 
may affect our results of operation and financial performance . Please refer to Section 8.1. 4
of this Prospectus for further details on the risk factor.

expiry of the tenancy agreement s or leases , the landlords have the right to change the 
terms and conditions of the tenancy agreement s or leases including increases in rental 
rates or even decide not to renew our tenancy agreement or leases . Any unfavourable
adjustments to our rental rates would affect our rental expenses and/or lease liabilities 
including the interest on lease liabilities that may increase our overall operating expenses.

reasonably likely to make the historical financial statements not indicative of the future 
financial performance and position, save for those that had been disclosed in this section

11.6 ORDER BOOK
Due to the nature of our business which is primarily involved in cafe chain operations as well as 
distribution and retail of our own brands of packaged foods , our Group does not maintain an order 
book. 
1 1 .7 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
T here are no significant changes that have occurred, which may have a material effect on our 
financial position and results subsequent to the FYE 2024 and up to the LPD. 
1 1 .8 DIVIDEND POLICY
It is our Directors' policy to allow our shareholders to participate in the profits of our Group as well 
as leaving adequate reserves for the future growth of our Group. 
It is the intention of our Board to recommend and distribute a dividend of 30.00% of the profit 
attributable to the owners of our Company after the Listing . Nevertheless, o ur Group's ability to 
distribute dividends or make other distributions to our shareholders is subject to various factors, 
such as profits recorded and excess of funds not required to be retained for working capital of our 
business. Our Directors will take into consideration, among others, the following factors when 
recommending dividends for approval by our shareholders or when declaring any dividends:
(i) the availability of adequate reserves and cash flows. As an investment holding company, 
our income, and therefore our ability to pay dividends, depends on the dividends or other 
distributions received from our subsidiaries; 
(ii) o ur operating cash flow requirements and financing commitments;

(iii) o ur anticipated future operating conditions, as well as future expansion, capital 
expenditure and investment plans; 
(iv) o ur Company is solvent as the Act requires; 
(v) a ny material impact of tax laws and other regulatory requirements; and 
(vi) p rior written consent from financial institutions, where required. 
However, investors should note that the intention to recommend dividends should not be treated 
as a legal obligation on our Company to do so. The level of dividends should also not be treated 
as an indication of our Company's future dividend policy. There can be no assurance that dividends 
will be paid out in the future or on timing of any dividends that are to be paid in the future. In 
determining dividends in respect of subsequent financial years, consideration will be given to 
maximising shareholders' value. There is no dividend restriction being imposed on our Group 
currently.
In addition, our ability to declare and pay interim dividends as well as to recommend final dividends 
are subject to the discretion of our Board. We will also need to obtain our shareholders’ approval 
for any final dividend for the year. 
No inference should or can be made from any of the statements above as to our actual future 
profitability and our ability to pay dividends in the future. 
As at the LPD, our Company has no intention to declare further dividends prior to the Listing. The 
dividends declared and paid for the past FYE 2021, FYE 2022, FYE 2023, FYE 2024 and up to 
the LPD are as follows:

control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial information of 
the Group that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
In preparing the financial information of the Group, the Directors are responsible for assessing the

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial information of the

Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial information.

REPORTING ACCOUNTANTS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION (CONT’D)  
 
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International 
Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:- 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial information of the Group, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors. 
 
 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our report to the related disclosures in the financial information of the Group or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial information of the Group, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial information of the Group represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
 
 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial information of the 
Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.  
 
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.

3. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION  
 
3.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
 
For the purposes of inclusion of combined financial statements in the Prospectus of Oriental Kopi in 
connection with the Listing, the combined financial statements comprise the combined statements 
of financial position as at 30 September 2021, 30 September 2022, 30 September 2023 and 30 
September 2024, combined statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, combined 
statements of changes in equity and combined statements of cash flows of the Group for the FYEs 
30 September 2021, 30 September 2022, 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2024. 
 
Entities under common control are entities which are ultimately controlled by the same parties and 
that control is not transitory. Control exists when the same parties have, as a result of contractual 
agreements, ultimate collective power to govern the financial and operating policies of each of the 
combining entities so as to obtain benefits from their activities, and that ultimate collective power is 
not transitory. The financial statements of common controlled entities are included in the combined 
financial statements from the day that control commences until the date that control ceases. 
 
The combined financial statements of the Group for the relevant period were prepared in a manner 
similar to the merger method, as if the entities within the Group were operating as a single economic 
enterprise from the beginning of the earliest comparative period covered by the relevant period or 
the dates of incorporation of entities within the Group, if later. Such manner of presentation reflects 
the economic substance of the combining companies, which were under common control throughout 
the relevant period. 
 
The identifiable assets and liabilities of all commonly controlled entities are accounted for at their 
historical costs. The accounting policies of common controlled entities have been changed where 
necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. 
 
All material intra-group transactions and balances have been eliminated on combination.

3. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D) 
 
3.3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION 
 
(a) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements 
 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty 
 
Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year other than as disclosed below:- 
 
(i) Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment  
 
The estimates for the residual values, useful lives and related depreciation charges for 
the property, plant and equipment are based on commercial factors which could 
change significantly as a result of technical innovations and competitors’ actions in 
response to the market conditions. The Group anticipates that the residual values of 
its property, plant and equipment will be insignificant. As a result, residual values are 
not being taken into consideration for the computation of the depreciable amount. 
Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development could impact 
the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future 
depreciation charges could be revised.  
 
(ii) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Right-of-use Assets 
 
The Group determines whether its property, plant and equipment and right-of-use 
assets is impaired by evaluating the extent to which the recoverable amount of the 
asset is less than its carrying amount. This evaluation is subject to changes such as 
market performance, economic and political situation of the country.  
 
(iii) Write-down of Inventories 
 
Reviews are made periodically by management on damaged, obsolete and slow-
moving inventories. These reviews require judgement and estimates. Possible 
changes in these estimates could result in revisions to the valuation of inventories.  
 
(iv) Impairment of Trade Receivables  
 
The Group uses the simplified approach to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss 
allowance for all trade receivables. The Group develops the expected loss rates based 
on the payment profiles of past sales and the corresponding historical credit losses, 
and adjusts for qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable forward-
looking information. If the expectation is different from the estimation, such difference 
will impact the carrying values of trade receivables. 
 
(v) Impairment of Non-Trade Receivables  
 
The loss allowances for non-trade financial assets are based on assumptions about 
risk of default (probability of default) and expected loss if a default happens (loss 
given default). It also requires the Group to assess whether there is a significant 
increase in credit risk of the non-trade financial asset at the reporting date. The 
Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting appropriate 
inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the past payment trends, existing 
market conditions and forward-looking information.

3.3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D) 
 
(a) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (Cont’d) 
 
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (Cont’d) 
 
Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the 
next financial year other than as disclosed below (Cont’d):- 
 
(vi) Income Taxes 
 
There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax 
determination may be different from the initial estimate. The Group recognises tax 
liabilities based on its understanding of the prevailing tax laws and estimates of 
whether such taxes will be due in the ordinary course of business. Where the final 
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, 
such difference will impact the income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the 
year in which such determination is made.  
 
(vii) Discount Rates used in Leases 
 
Where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Group 
uses the incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liabilities.  The incremental 
borrowing rate is the interest rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a 
similar term, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-
use asset in a similar economic environment. Therefore, the incremental borrowing 
rate requires estimation particularly when no observable rates are available or when 
they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease.  The Group 
estimates the incremental borrowing rate using observable inputs when available and 
is required to make certain entity-specific estimates. 
 
(viii) Provision of Restoration Costs 
 
The provision of restoration costs are estimated using the assumptions that removal 
and restoration will only take place upon expiry of the lease terms.  
  
While the provisions are based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic 
lives of the affected assets, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing 
of incurring these costs. All the estimates are reviewed on an annual basis or more 
frequently, where there is indication of a material change. 
 
(ix) Contract Liabilities  
 
Contract liabilities represent the deferral in the recognition of revenue for cash vouchers 
and membership points under the loyalty membership programme that are expected 
to be redeemed. It also represents the aggregate amount of the transaction price 
allocated to the performance obligations that are partially unsatisfied as at the end of 
the reporting period.  
 
The amount of sale proceeds apportioned to contract liabilities is estimated based on 
the historical redemption pattern for the cash vouchers and the stand alone selling price 
of the merchandise to be redeemed by using the membership points.

3.3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D) 
 
(a) Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (Cont’d) 
 
Critical Judgements Made in Applying Accounting Policies 
 
Management believes that there are no instances of application of critical judgement in 
applying the Group’s accounting policies which will have a significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements other than as disclosed below:- 
 
Lease Terms  
 
Some leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group before the end of the non-
cancellable contract period. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and 
circumstances including the past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset 
if an option to extend is not taken. An extension option is only included in the lease term if the 
lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). 
 
(b) Basis of Combination  
 
The Group resulting from the restructuring exercise, as disclosed in Note 30, comprises 
entities under common control. Accordingly, the combined financial statements have been 
accounted for using principles of merger accounting. 
 
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the 
Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.  
 
Intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on combination. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to 
ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. 
 
(i) Business Combinations 
 
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under 
the acquisition method, the consideration transferred for acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests 
issued by the Group at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred includes 
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Acquisition-related costs, other than the costs to issue debt or equity 
securities, are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 
 
In a business combination achieved in stages, previously held equity interests in the 
acquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and any corresponding 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

3.3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT’D) 
 
(b) Basis of Combination (Cont’d) 
 
(i) Business Combinations (Cont’d) 
 
Non-controlling interests in the acquiree may be initially measured either at fair value 
or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. The choice of 
measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.  
 
However, an acquisition that resulted in a business combination involving common 
control entities is outside the scope of MFRS 3 Business Combinations. For such 
common control combinations, the merger accounting principles are used to include 
the assets, liabilities, results, equity changes and cash flows of the combining 
entities in the audited combined financial statements. 
 
In applying merger accounting, financial statements items of the combining entities 
or businesses for the reporting period in which common control combination occurs 
are included in the audited financial statements of the Group as if the combination 
had occurred from the date when the combining entities or businesses first come 
under the control of the controlling party or parties. Under merger accounting, the 
Group recognises the assets, liabilities and equity of the combining entities or 
businesses at the carrying amount as if such audited financial statements had been 
prepared by the controlling party including adjustments required for conforming to 
the Groups’ accounting policies and applying those policies to all period presented. 
There is no recognition of any goodwill or a gain from bargain purchase at the time 
of the common control combination. The effect of all transactions and balances 
between combining entities, whether occurring before or after the combination, are 
eliminated in preparing the audited combined financial statements of the Group. 
 
(ii) Non-controlling Interests 
 
Non-controlling interests are presented within equity in the combined statements of 
financial position, separately from the equity attributable to owners of the Company. 
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to 
the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total 
comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results 
in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 
 
(iii) Changes in Ownership Interests in Subsidiaries Without Change of Control 
 
All changes in the parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a 
loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the 
amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of 
consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity of the Group.

(b) Basis of Combination (Cont’d) 
 
(iv) Loss of Control 
 
Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group recognises any gain or loss on 
disposal in profit or loss which is calculated as the difference between:- 
 
(i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair 
value of any retained interest in the former subsidiary; and 
 
(ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and 
liabilities of the former subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. 
 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the 
former subsidiary are accounted for in the same manner as would be required if the 
relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or 
transferred directly to retained profits). The fair value of any investments retained in 
the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on 
initial recognition for subsequent accounting under MFRS 139 or, when applicable, 
the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a joint venture. 
 
(c) Investments in Joint Ventures 
 
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in the combined 
financial statements of the Group. 
 
(d) Financial Instruments 
 
(i) Financial Assets 
 
Financial Assets At Amortised Cost 
 
The financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs except 
for trade receivables without significant financing component which are measured 
at transaction price only. Subsequent to the initial recognition, all financial assets 
are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. 
 
(ii) Financial Liabilities 
 
Financial Liabilities At Amortised Cost 
 
The financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs. 
Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at 
amortised cost. 
 
(iii) Equity  
 
Ordinary Shares 
 
Ordinary shares are recorded on initial recognition at the proceeds received less 
directly attributable transaction costs incurred. The ordinary shares are not 
remeasured subsequently.

(e) Property, Plant and Equipment  
 
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.  
 
Subsequent to initial recognition, all property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. 
 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method 
to allocate their depreciable amounts over the estimated useful lives. The principal annual 
depreciation rate are:- 
 
Furniture, fittings and renovation  20% 
Kitchen equipment  20% 
Office equipment  20% 
Motor vehicles   20% 
Warehouse equipment   20% 
 
Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as 
these assets are not yet available for use. 
 
(f) Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities 
 
(i) Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets 
 
The Group apply the “short-term lease” and “lease of low-value assets” recognition 
exemption. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an 
operating expense on a straight-line method over the term of the lease unless another 
systematic basis is more appropriate. 
 
(ii) Right-of-use Assets 
 
Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost including the estimated cost of 
dismantling and removing the items and restoring that site on which they are located. 
Subsequent to the initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for 
any remeasurement of lease liabilities. 
 
The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the 
commencement date to the earlier of the end of the estimated useful lives of the right-
of-use assets or the end of the lease term. 
 
(iii) Lease Liabilities 
 
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that 
are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the entities’ incremental 
borrowing rate. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the lease liabilities are measured 
at amortised cost and adjusted for any lease reassessment or modifications. 
 
(g) Inventories 
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the 
first-in, first-out method and comprises all costs of purchase plus other costs incurred in bringing 
the inventories to their present location and condition.

(h) Provisions 
 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a 
result of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate of the amount can 
be made. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect 
the current best estimate. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision 
is the present value of the estimated expenditure required to settle the obligation. The discount 
rate shall be a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as interest 
expense in profit or loss. 
 
Dismantling, Removal and Restoration Costs 
 
A provision is recognised when the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove structures 
on identified sites and restore these sites to an acceptable condition. The provision is measured 
at the present value of the compounded future expenditure at current prices and is recognised 
as part of the cost of the relevant asset. The capitalised cost is depreciated over the expected 
life of the asset. 
 
(i) Revenue from Contract with Customers 
 
Revenue is recognised by reference to each distinct performance obligation in the contract 
with customer and is measured at the consideration specified in the contract of which the 
Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a 
customer, net of sales and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. 
 
The Group recognises revenue when (or as) it transfers control over a product or service to 
customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of the asset. 
 
The Group transfers control of a good or service at a point in item unless one of the following 
overtime criteria is met:- 
 
 The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the 
Group performs. 
 
 The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls 
as the asset is created or enhanced. 
 
 The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the 
Company has an enforceable right to payment.  
 
(i) Sales of goods with credit term 
 
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred control of the 
goods to the customer, being when the goods have been delivered to the customer and 
upon its acceptance. 
 
A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that 
the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the 
payment is due.

(i) Revenue from Contract with Customers (Cont’d) 
 
(ii) Sales of goods and rendering of services with cash term 
 
Revenue from sale of goods and rendering of services is recognised when the Group has 
transferred control of the goods to the customer, being at the point the customer purchases 
the goods at the retail outlets or when the services have been rendered to the customers. 
Payment for the transaction is due immediately at the point the customer purchases the 
goods and takes delivery in outlet. 
 
The Group operates a loyalty membership programme where retail customers accumulate 
points or receive cash vouchers for purchase made which entitle them to exchange for 
food, beverage or merchandise. Past experience is used to estimate and provide for 
discount using expected value method. A contract liability for award points is recognised 
at the time of the initial sales transactions. Revenue is recognised when the points are 
redeemed by customer or expire.

Under certain property lease arrangements, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove 
structures on certain sites and restore those sites at the end of the lease terms to an acceptable 
condition consistent with the lease arrangement. 
The provisions are estimated using the assumption that removal and restoration will only take place 
upon expiry of the lease terms.
While the provisions are based on the best estimates of future costs and the economic lives of the 
affected assets, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs. 
All the estimates are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently, where there is indication of a 
material change.
Provision for restoration costs is classified as non - current liabilities unless the remaining lease period 
of leases , for which the restoration is required, expires within 12 months after the reporting date.

loss made) together with their terms and conditions are disclosed in the respective notes to the 
financial statements. 
 
 
28. OPERATING SEGMENTS  
 
The Group operates predominantly in food and beverage business segment in Malaysia. 
Accordingly, the information by business and geographical segments is not presented.  
 
Major Customers 
 
There is no single customer that contributed 10% or more to the Group’s revenue. 
 
 
29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of market risk (including foreign currency risk, interest 
rate risk and equity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall financial risk 
management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.  
 
29.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES  
 
The Group’s policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are as follows:-  
 
(a) Market Risk 
 
(i) Foreign Currency Risk 
 
Any reasonably possible change in the foreign currency exchange rates at the 
end of the reporting period against the respective functional currencies of the 
entities within the Group does not have a material impact on the (loss)/profit after 
taxation and equity of the Group and hence, no sensitivity analysis is presented.

29.2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES (CONT’D) 
 
The Group’s policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are as follows (Cont’d):-  
 
(a) Market Risk (Cont’d) 
 
(ii) Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The 
Group’s policy is to obtain the most favourable interest rates available and by 
maintaining a balanced portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings. 
 
The Group’s fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Therefore, they 
are not subject to interest rate risk as in defined MFRS 7 since neither carrying 
amounts nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market 
interest rates. 
 
Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis 
 
The Group does not have any floating rate borrowings and hence, no sensitivity 
analysis is presented. 
 
(iii) Equity Rate Risk 
 
The Group does not have any quoted investments and hence, is not exposed to 
equity price risk.  
 
(b) Credit Risk 
 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk, or the risk of counterparties defaulting, arises 
mainly from trade and other receivables. The Group manages its exposure to credit risk 
by the application of credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures on an 
ongoing basis. For other financial assets (including cash and bank balances), the Group 
minimises credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties. 
 
(i) Credit Risk Concentration Profile 
 
The Group’s major concentration of credit risk relates to the amounts owing by 3 
(2023 – 2; 2022 – 1; 2021 – Nil) customers which constituted approximately 37% 
(2023 – 61%; 2022 – 34%; 2021 – Nil) of its trade receivables (including related 
parties) at the end of the reporting period.  
 
(ii) Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk 
 
At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is 
represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised 
in the statement of financial position of the Group and of the Company after 
deducting any allowance for impairment losses (where applicable).

(iii) Assessment of Impairment Losses 
 
The Group has an informal credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk 
is monitored on an on-going basis through periodic review of the ageing of the 
trade receivables. The Group closely monitors the trade receivables’ financial 
strength to reduce the risk of loss.  
 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether any of the financial assets 
at amortised cost, contract assets are credit impaired.  
 
The gross carrying amounts of financial assets are written off against the 
associated impairment, if any, when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery despite the fact that they are still subject to enforcement activities.  
 
A financial asset is credit impaired when any of following events that have a 
detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have 
occurred:  
 
- Significant financial difficulty of the receivable; 
- A breach of contract, such as default or past due event; 
- Restructuring of a debt in relation to the receivable’s financial difficulty; 
- It is becoming a probable that the receivable will enter bankruptcy or other 
financial reorganisation. 
 
The Group considers a receivable to be in default when the receivable is unlikely 
to repay its debt to the Group in full or is more than 90 days past due unless the 
Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more 
a lagging default criterion is more appropriate.   
 
Trade Receivables and Amount Owing by Related Parties (Trade Balances) 
 
The Group applies the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses 
using a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables. 
 
Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses  
 
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped 
based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.  
 
The Group measures the expected credit losses of certain major customers, 
trade receivables that are credit impaired and trade receivables with a high risk 
of default on individual basis.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses 
(Cont’d) 
 
The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales before the 
reporting date and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within 
this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-
looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the trade 
receivables to settle their debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group 
has identified the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), 
Unemployment Rate and Food Inflation Rate as the key macroeconomic 
factors of the forward-looking information. 
 
There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions 
as compared to the previous financial year.

(iii) Assessment of Impairment Losses (Cont’d) 
 
Other Receivables and Amount Owing by Related Parties (Non-trade balances) 
 
The Group applies the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit 
losses for its other receivables and amount owing by related parties.  
 
Under this approach, loss allowance is measured on either 12-month expected 
credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses, by considering the likelihood 
that the receivable would not be able to repay during the contractual period 
(probability of default, PD), the percentage of contractual cash flows that will 
not be collected if default happens (loss given default, LGD) and the 
outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk (exposure at default, EAD).  
 
In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group considers the receivable’s past payment 
status and its financial condition as at the reporting date. The PD is adjusted to 
reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors 
affecting the ability of the receivable to settle its debts.  
 
Allowance for Impairment Losses  
 
No expected credit loss is recognised on other receivables as it is negligible.  
 
Fixed Deposits with Licensed Banks, Cash and Bank Balances 
 
The Group considers the licensed banks have low credit risks. In addition, some 
of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Therefore, the 
Group is of the view that the loss allowance is immaterial and hence, it is not 
provided for.

13.9 ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
The following are 2 past legal proceedings involving Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min and 
Koay Song Leng outside our Group which have since been resolved:
(i) In the first suit (“ Suit 1”), the claimants (“Plaintiffs 1 ”) and a company outside our Group 
which Dato’ Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min and Koay Song Leng were shareholders and 
directors of (“ Defendant ”) had entered into respective agreements, under which the 
Plaintiffs were granted permission to utilise the certain brand names (“Brand ”) for operating 
their beverage product business. Legal proceedings were commenced as a writ action on 5 
May 2023 by the Plaintiffs against the Defendant (“ Original Suit ”) seeking, a declaration 
that the respec tive agreements entered into with the Defendant should be read as franchise 
agreements under the Franchise Act 1998 and as such the respective agreements and the 
guarantees given under the agreements were invalid, null and void as they were executed 
withou t compliance with the requisite procedures mandated for establishing such a business 
operation. The Plaintiffs further sought restitution for the return of all monies and interest 
paid under the respective agreements and/or compensation of loss arising fro m the 
operational losses suffered by the Plaintiffs, including the costs associated with establishing 
their respective operations. Consequent thereto, a counterclaim was filed by the Defendant 
against the directors of the Plaintiffs as guarantors for recovery of monies owing to the 
Defendant by the Plaintiffs . Additionally, the Defendant sought to recover the revenue 
generated by the Plaintiffs through the use of the Defendant’s Brand and resources, as a 
counterclaim against the restitutionary demands made by the Plaintiffs under the Original 
Suit (“Counterclaim to the Original Suit ”). In response to the Defendant’s counterclaim, 
the Plaintiffs’ directors filed a subsequent counterclaim against the Defendant, and Dato’ 
Chan Jian Chern, Chan Yen Min, and Koay Song Leng (the “ Named Individuals ”), who 
were the then directors and shareholders of the Defendant. This subsequent counterclaim 
involved allegations of conspiracy to deceive and induce the Plaintiffs to enter into the 
respective agreements and alleged that there were misrepresentations concerning the 
ownership of the Defendant’s Brand and the nature of the Defendant's business, and that 
the signatures of the Plainti ffs’ directors on the guarantees were forged by the Named 
Individuals. The relief pursu ed in this counterclaim was identical to, that which was sought 
in the Original Suit but was now being advanced by the Plaintiff’s directors in their individual 
capacities (“Plaintiffs’ Directors Counterclaim to the Counterclaim to the Original 
Suit ”). 
(ii) In the second suit (“Suit 2 ”) the claimant (“Plaintiff 2 ”) and the Defendant had entered into 
similar agreements as the agreements in Suit 1. Similar legal proceedings as Suit 1 were 
commenced as a writ action on 8 May 2023 by Plaintiff 2 against the Defendant (“ Original 
Suit 2 ”). Consequent thereto, a similar counterclaim was filed by the Defendant against the 
director of Plaintiff 2 as guarantor (“Counterclaim to the Original Suit 2 ”).  In response to 
the Defendant’s counterclaim, Plaintiff 2’s dire ctor filed a similar subsequent counterclaim 
against the Defendant, and the Named Individuals (“Plaintiff’s Director’s Counterclaim to 
the Counterclaim to the Original Suit 2 ”). 
Around 13 December 2023, a mediation proceeding was initiated by the solicitors acting for the 
Plaintiffs 1 and Plaintiff 2, requesting that the particulars of a mediation notice be provided for 
processing by the Court Mediation Centre, with the aim of res olving Suit 1 and Suit 2 amicably.
However, the mediation process did not result in a resolution.
In the event that Suit 1 and Suit 2 had proceeded in Court, the solicitors acting for the Defendant 
and the Named Individuals are of the view that there is a high probability that the Named Individuals 
will successfully resist the Plaintiffs’ Directors Counterclaim to the Counterclaim to the Original Suit 
and Plaintiffs’ Directors Counterclaim to the Counterclaim to the Original Suit.

Status as at LPD 
Pursuant to negotiations, and notwithstanding that there was a high probability of success, after 
careful deliberation and taking into consideration the potential time and time costs to be incurred, the
