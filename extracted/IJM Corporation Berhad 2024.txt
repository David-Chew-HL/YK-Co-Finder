CORPORATE PROFIlE
Headquartered in Malaysia, IJM Corporation Berhad is a leading 
construction group with an international footprint. Our success lies  
in harnessing synergies between our four core businesses: 
Construction, Property, Industry and Infrastructure. Each business 
division is an industry leader in their own right, driven by the Group’s 
shared vision and mission.
For over 40 years, IJM has been redefining 
skylines, connecting communities and 
enriching lives both in Malaysia and globally. 
Our multidisciplinary workforce, progressive 
leadership, financial prudence and enterprise 
have made us a sought-after partner for 
privatisation as well as iconic and complex 
projects across various sectors. 
Incorporated in 1983 through the merger of 
three mid-size construction companies to 
professionalise the Malaysian construction 
industry, IJM was listed on Bursa Malaysia  
in 1986 and has been growing from 
strength to strength ever since. A significant  
milestone was the acquisition of Road  
Builder Group in 2007, enhancing our 
portfolio with an impressive array of iconic 
buildings, townships and infrastructure 
projects.
IJM has demonstrated exceptional resilience, 
successfully navigating three economic 
crises and numerous policy shifts, while 
continuously finding opportunities to thrive 
amid the cyclical nature of the industries 
we operate in. Through unwavering 
commitment, we have remained steadfast 
in fulfilling our promise to stakeholders as  
a successful business.
OUR CORE BUSINESSES
IJM began its journey as a construction 
company, subsequently diversifying into  
property development, industry and 
infrastructure concessions. Our core 
businesses have played pivotal roles in our 
growth:
Construction
As one of Malaysia’s leading construction 
firms, IJM excels in both greenfield and 
brownfield projects, contributing significantly 
to nation-building and urban renewal. Our 
portfolio includes iconic skyscrapers in 
the Kuala Lumpur city centre, extensive 
infrastructure connecting communities, 
and national railway projects like the MRT, 
LRT and KTM, enhancing urban mobility. 
Additionally, IJM is shifting its focus to the 
industrial, logistics and data centre sectors, 
demonstrating our ability to adapt to industry 
opportunities and drive economic growth 
with comprehensive infrastructure solutions.
Property
The Group’s property arm, IJM Land 
Berhad, one of Malaysia’s largest real estate 
developers, is renowned for its award-
winning developments in strategic growth 
areas. With a commitment to creating living 
spaces that inspire harmony and a sense of 
community, IJM Land’s portfolio includes 
expansive townships, commercial buildings 
and high-rise condominiums. Internationally, 
IJM Land is involved in projects in London, 
United Kingdom and China, and the Group 
is recognised for township development in 
India, with credentials extending to Orlando, 
USA, Singapore and Australia.
Industry
Spearheaded by Industrial Concrete  
Products Sdn. Bhd. (“ICP”), this division is 
involved in quarrying and manufacturing 
building materials, providing a reliable 
supply chain for the Group’s construction 
operations. ICP is a market leader in 
pretensioned spun high-strength concrete 
piles in Southeast Asia and commands 
a strong presence in Malaysia and India. 
Additionally, IJM IBS Sdn Bhd offers 
SMART IBS industrialised building systems 
solutions, providing prefabricated building 
components that enhance construction 
efficiency and quality. The division  
also supplies essential materials such as 
aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, sand 
and scaffolding, further integrating into IJM’s 
value chain and bolstering our construction 
and property development projects.

Infrastructure
The Group is also an investor, owner 
and operator of privatised infrastructure 
concessions that generate steady recurring 
income streams. 
Toll: In Malaysia, the ownership includes 
prominent expressways such as NPE, 
BESRAYA and LEKAS. IJM also holds 
an equity interest in the West Coast 
Expressway, currently under construction 
with IJM Construction serving as the main 
contractor. Building on its track record 
as a concessionaire in Malaysia, IJM 
has garnered further recognition through  
Build-Operate-Transfer projects abroad. 
Notable investments include the Dewas 
Bypass Tollway and Solapur-Bijapur Tollway 
in India, as well as the Western Access 
Tollway in Argentina.
Port: Kuantan Port, which celebrates its  
50th anniversary this year, is one of the 
Group’s key strategic assets on the East 
Coast. Positioned as the “Gateway to the  
East”, Kuantan Port offers seamless 
connectivity to the Malaysia-China Kuantan 
Industrial Park and the East Coast Rail 
Link which will be ready in 2027. Serving a  
vast hinterland, the Port facilitates 
the movement of goods and bolsters 
economic activities in the region. Its 
expansion and modernisation efforts have 
significantly increased its capacity and 
operational efficiency, cementing its role 
as a vital logistics hub. The Port’s robust 
performance underscores our commitment 
to enhancing regional connectivity and  
trade capabilities.
SYNERGY AND GROWTH STORY
The synergy across IJM’s diverse divisions 
forms the backbone of our growth story. 
Each business complements and enhances 
the others, creating a robust value chain that 
drives efficiency, innovation and sustainable 
growth. Our construction projects benefit 
from the reliable supply of high-quality 
materials from our Industry division, while 
our property developments leverage the 
comprehensive infrastructure solutions we 
provide. This integrated approach enables 
us to deliver complex and large-scale 
projects with precision and excellence, 
reinforcing our reputation as a trusted and 
reliable partner in the industry.
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENT
Entering our fifth decade of business, 
IJM has prioritised the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals. We focus 
on delivering sustainable value – economic, 
social and environmental – in alignment 
with global standards and practices. Our 
aim is to be a more responsible builder, 
elevating industry standards and upholding 
sustainable practices.
At IJM, we firmly believe in our shared 
destiny with employees, recognising that 
their contributions are key to our ongoing 
success. Our commitment to ethical 
business conduct and responsible growth, 
driven by sustainability principles, defines  
the core of our character. As of 31 March  
2024, our market capitalisation stood at 
RM8.5 billion, with total assets valued at 
RM21.3 billion, and a dedicated workforce of 
approximately 3,500 employees, showcasing 
our financial strength and human capital.
Our Brand Promise:  
We Deliver
At IJM, we are committed to meeting 
the needs of our stakeholders with 
our brand promise: We deliver. This 
guiding philosophy drives all our 
business decisions and actions. We 
promise our stakeholders that we 
will leverage our experience and  
know-how to deliver inspired 
solutions that bear the IJM Mark  
of Excellence.

GATEwAY  
TO GROwTH
In FY2024, Kuantan Port celebrated its 50th anniversary, marking a  
half-century of facilitating trade and growth. The Port’s performance was  
bolstered by government-approved tariff adjustments and increased  
throughput. As a vital node of the Belt and Road Initiative, our developments 
ensure enhanced connectivity, driving regional and international trade.  
Growth is further supported by the expansion of Malaysia-China Kuantan  
Industrial Park and connectivity with the East Coast Rail Line. Future phases  
of the deepwater terminal expansion cater to an expanding hinterland of  
new customers and diverse cargo types, making the Port an essential  
gateway to growth in the east coast region.
Strategically located, Kuantan Port is Malaysia’s 
largest dry bulk port, serving local and international 
trade demands

IJM Corporation Berhad’s (“IJM”) share price (stock code: 3336) improved steadily over the course of the financial 
year, reaching its 12-month high of RM2.32 in March 2024. The rise in share price was driven by an improved 
outlook of the construction sector that was supported by continued job flows from a burgeoning industrial 
property subsector that included data centres, logistic warehouses and electrical and electronics manufacturing 
plants. The positive momentum continued in the later months of the financial year on the optimism that Budget 
2024 would further drive growth and provide more opportunities for contractors and developers. IJM was seen as 
a strong contender for large-scale infrastructure projects given its financial strength and execution track record.
IJM’s share price increased 45% compared to a 15% gain by the FBM100 in the same period of IJM’s financial 
year of 2024. 
B. IJM 2014/2034 Sukuk Murabahah (RM3.0 billion)

AA3(s) and P1(s) ratings to IJM Treasury Management

ENSuRING MOBIlITY
In FY2024, our toll portfolio saw mixed results. In Malaysia, a restructuring 
exercise at BESRAYA and LEKAS led to lower toll rates but extended  
concession periods, setting the stage for future growth despite short-term 
revenue setbacks. The New Pantai Expressway is in advanced stages of 
restructuring and involves major upgrading works that will enhance the  
highway’s connectivity to Kuala Lumpur city centre. 
The West Coast Expressway saw its Perak alignment fully opened to the  
public during the year while the Selangor stretch is due for completion in  
FY2026, culminating in the country’s second longest tollway aimed at  
improving travel efficiency and supporting economic development along  
the corridor. In India, toll losses declined and one concession expired.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Dear Stakeholders,
Our increasing focus on the Group’s 
‘Drive Growth’ strategic pillar has 
started to bear fruit. I am delighted 
to report that year-on-year revenue 
increased by 29.4% while profit after 
tax and minority interest grew almost 
four-fold from FY2023. For the first  
time in six years, the company’s 
current market value surpassed  
the consolidated net tangible assets. 
Our business segments are seeing 
positive organic growth prospects. 
Additionally, we are reprioritising our 
expansion strategies geographically  
to leverage breakthrough successes 
and we are entering adjacent business 
verticals for potential synergies.  
As our opportunities evolve, we will 
also explore optimising our capital 
profile to better distinguish our 
concession-related business. This 
would improve the Group’s cost of 
capital and provide us a more  
potent balance sheet to undertake 
large-scale projects in future.
As we continue our journey of 
delivering value to our stakeholders, 
the Group remains committed 
to advancing our three-pronged 
strategic focus, which is anchored 
by our strong reputation, execution 
capabilities and financial discipline.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE
The year 2023 saw continued 
economic recovery in Malaysia, 
which grew by 3.7%, normalising 
from a growth of 8.7% in 2022. 
Despite relatively high levels of global 
inflation, geopolitical tensions and 
the US dollar strength, the Malaysian 
economy saw a resilient domestic 
demand, improving labour market 
conditions and a resurgence in private 
sector capital spending, particularly  
in information technology and 
electrical and electronics. The 
economic vibrancy was reflected in 
the uplift in the Group’s operating 
activities during the year.
In FY2024, the Group achieved 
revenue amounting to RM5,918.81 
million, representing a 29.4% increase 
compared to RM4,572.49 million 
in the preceding year. Additionally, 
the Group recorded pre-tax profits 
of RM964.17 million, representing 
a substantial increase of 99.6% 
compared to RM483.03 million in 
the previous year. Correspondingly, 
consolidated profit after tax and 
minority interest increased by  
279.3% to RM600.28 million from 
RM158.28 million last year.  
With improving economic conditions, 
our business operations continued 
to generate significant cash 
flow. Operating activities yielded 
RM1,159.53 million in FY2024, 7.5% 
higher than RM1,078.45 million 
the previous year. It marked the 
fifth consecutive year when our net 
operating cash flow exceeded RM1 
billion, showcasing the consistent 
strength of our business operations.
As of 31 March 2024, the Group 
held substantial cash reserves of 
RM2,870.39 million and had a net  
debt of RM2,663.91 million. Due to 
prudent financial management, net 
gearing increased slightly to 0.26 
times. The consolidated balance 
sheet remains healthy, especially 
considering that the Group’s business 
model includes using long-term 
non-recourse debt to develop our 
concession assets portfolio. 
BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND 
OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES 
FOR FY2025
The global economy is expected 
to sustain its steady growth path in  
2024, with a projected growth of  
3.2%, marginally higher than the 
previous year. This outlook is 
supported by a declining inflation 
trend and strong global trade, but 
potentially dampened by weak 
demand in China and Europe, as well 
as ongoing conflicts in the Middle 
East and Ukraine.
On the domestic front, Malaysia 
is expected to experience an  
accelerated growth of between 
4.0% to 5.0% in 2024, supported 
by favourable global economic 
conditions and higher domestic 
expenditure. The healthy growth 
also provided the Government an 
opportunity to undertake necessary 
domestic policy reforms, such as 
the introduction of the National 
Energy Transition Roadmap and  
New Industrial Master Plan. Although 
diesel subsidy rationalisation and  
the hike in service tax rate have 
adverse bearing on the inflation 
outlook, targeted cash assistance 
to address cost of living concerns, 
and continued resilience in domestic  
public and private spending are 
expected to sustain the positive 
economic trajectory.

BESRAYA Highway
The Malaysian landscape is witnessing 
a resurgence in foreign direct 
investments and interest, primarily 
from multinational manufacturing 
companies adopting a China Plus  
One strategy. Additionally, there 
is a surge in new data centre 
developments, activities at the Johor-
Singapore Special Economic Zone 
as well as the transformation of the 
Sarawak state’s economy. They 
represent opportunities for the Group, 
which has already made inroads in 
some of these new developments.
The Group is optimistic of the 
outlook for our business divisions. 
Order book replenishment prospects 
for the Construction and Industry 
Divisions are bright. Additionally, 
strong property sales in FY2024, 
improved cargo throughput at the  
Port operations, and tollway traffic 
growth are expected to sustain the 
Group’s growth momentum.
In FY2024, the Construction Division 
secured RM3.7 billion in new 
construction contracts, delivering 
an outstanding order book of RM6.0 
billion at the year-end. A strong 
balance sheet and track record 
positions the Group well to pursue 
projects in manufacturing, large data 
centres, logistics warehouses, and 
upcoming mega public infrastructure 
projects like the Klang Valley MRT 
3, Penang LRT, and flood mitigation 
initiatives. 
The Property Division achieved sales 
of RM2.4 billion in FY2024, marking 
this the third consecutive year we 
surpassed the RM2 billion mark. 
While maintaining a positive outlook 
on property sales, the division has 
also diversified into the thriving 
logistics sector by co-developing  
two warehousing logistics buildings 
during the financial year. Both 
locations are earmarked to be 
operated by established logistics 
and supply chain players, which will 
provide these investment properties 
with stable recurrent income upon 
operational commencement. 
The division also made significant 
inroads into the UK property market. 
In the near term, we will be embarking 
on Phase Two of the Royal Mint 
Gardens, London, building upon 
the breakthrough success of the 
first phase. Phase Two entails the 
development of a 455-unit aparthotel, 
in collaboration with an established 
operator, along with 79 residential  
units. Additionally, the division will 
redevelop a recently acquired 11-acre 
piece of land in Welwyn Garden City  
into a residential-led mixed-
development that is strategically 
located adjacent to a train station  
and mature shopping area.
The division’s exclusive partnership 
with Network Rail Property in UK 
property development ventures gives 
us the opportunity to identify suitable 
brownfield sites, owned by Network 
Rail, and “create” new development 
space above railway infrastructure 
as part of the urban regeneration 
of Central London. The partnership 
has thus far identified eight sites 
that are now at the stage of detailed 
infrastructure and enabling design 
works with key stakeholders and 
planning authorities. 
Following two successive years 
of record-breaking financial 
performance, the growth momentum 
of the Industry Division is expected  
to continue on the back of the 
resurgent construction sector, 
both domestically and abroad. The 
division’s balance order book, which 
was approximately 900,000 metric 
tonnes as of 31 March 2024, is 
expected to underpin our performance 
in the near term. Meanwhile, our 
SMART IBS capabilities continue to 
grow in strategic importance as part 
of the Group’s construction solution, 
especially for industrial projects  
with accelerated timelines.
Kuantan Port saw a marked recovery 
in cargo throughput in FY2024 to  
26.2 million freight weight tonnes 
compared to 22.7 million freight  
weight tonnes in FY2023. Notably, 
there was an increase in dry bulk 
cargo handled during the financial 
year, largely driven by the growth 
in bauxite, coal, iron ore and steel 
products. During the year, the  
pick-up in foreign direct investments 
activities at the Malaysia-China 
Kuantan Industrial Park (“MCKIP”) 
signalled promising long-term growth 
for Kuantan Port. Furthermore, 

---- Page 59 ----

the Government’s commitment to 
infrastructure development in the 
area, predominantly through the East 
Coast Rail Line project, positions 
Kuantan Port as a crucial driver for  
the economic growth of the East 
Coast region.
The Group’s Toll operations 
experienced a complete recovery in 
traffic volumes to pre-Covid levels 
after the reopening of economic 
activities. The concessions of  
BESRAYA and LEKAS have been 
restructured to be operated for a 
longer duration. The restructuring 
of NPE is presently in advance 
stages of negotiations with the 
Government and involves major 
upgrading works. NPE2 has been 
identified under the KL Structure Plan 
2040 as part of a planned highway 
network extension to enhance road 
connectivity with other highways,  
as well as facilitate smoother traffic 
flow and effective dispersal. Following 
the restructuring of the NPE, IJM 
will own three highways boasting 
established traffic profiles and with 
extended concessions periods. This 
positions the Group with considerable  
value-unlocking potential that may 
pave the way for further growth 
undertakings. 
Meanwhile, the Group continues to 
nurture our highway concessions 
in India that are in the early stages  
of maturity, while working to  
secure additional build-operate-
transfer highway concessions 
from the resumed tender activities  
post-Indian general elections. 
More details of the Group’s financial 
performance and business outlook 
can be found in the Management 
Discussion and Analysis section of 
this Annual Report.
COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE AND 
SUSTAINABILITY
In recent years, sustainability 
has grown rapidly as a strategic 
imperative for organisations. As 
societies worldwide confront urgent 
environmental and social issues, 
businesses recognise the need to 
adopt sustainable practices for  
long-term success and to mitigate 
negative impacts on planetary 
health and people at large. At IJM, 
we prioritise sustainability to align 
our goals with the broader societal 
interest, promoting environmental 
stewardship, social equity, and 
economic resilience.
In April 2023, IJM announced our 
climate strategy, R2O, which entails 
transitioning to net-zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 while concurrently 
establishing climate resilience across 
the Group. We made encouraging 
progress across our four key 
sustainability pillars of Marketplace, 
Environment, Workplace and 
Community. 
Our Corporate Governance Statement 
can be found on pages 98 to 109, 
and our sustainability performance 
is detailed in the Sustainability 
Statement on pages 128 to 215.  
APPRECIATION
Two board members, Mr Goh Tian Sui 
and Tunku Alina Raja Muhd Alias will 
be retiring at the conclusion of our 
Annual General Meeting on 29 August 
2024. On behalf of the Board of 
Directors, I wish to record our sincere 
appreciation for their years of service 
and invaluable contributions rendered 
to the Group. 
I would like to thank our investors, 
customers, business associates, and 
partners for your continued support

During the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (“FY2024”), the Group  
recorded a notable 29.4% increase in consolidated revenue, rising from 
RM4,572.49 million to RM5,918.81 million. This growth was driven by 
higher revenue in the Construction, Property, Industry, and Infrastructure 
Port divisions.
The Group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) surged by 47.8%, reaching RM1,572.28 million in FY2024,  
up from RM1,063.99 million previously. Profit before tax (“PBT”) doubled 
to RM964.17 million, from RM483.03 million in the previous year.  
Increases in both the EBITDA and PBT were largely contributed by the 
Infrastructure Toll and Port businesses.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The global economic growth 
moderated to 3.1% in 2023, 
from 3.4% a year ago. Malaysia’s 
economy grew 3.7% in 2023, 
a normalised level compared 
to 8.7% recorded the previous 
year and was mainly weighed 
down by the challenging external 
environment of slower global 
trade, the global tech downcycle, 
geopolitical tensions and tighter 
monetary policies. Despite 
these challenges, domestic 
growth was supported by lower 
unemployment, steady growth 
in private consumption as well 
as continued public and private 
capital spending.
Continuing the growth momentum 
from 2022’s rebound of 5.0%, 
the Malaysian construction 
industry grew 6.1% in 2023. The 
private sector made a significant 
comeback, triggered by a 
demand for high-rise residential 
developments, logistics projects 
and data centre developments. In 
the public sector, the government 
took steps to boost economic 
growth with various national 
projects, including accelerating 
large-scale public transportation 
projects whilst igniting transit-
oriented developments, intercity 
rail links with the revitalisation 
of real estate in the surrounding 
areas.

After excluding non-recurring items 
during the financial period for gains 
on foreign exchange, revaluation of 
WCE Holdings Bhd’s warrants and 
impairment reversal on LEKAS’s loan 
stocks, our core PBT was sustained 
at RM821.87 million, a slight increase 
of 3.0% from the previous year’s

Moreover, the Group’s profit after

The Group maintained a healthy 
balance sheet through prudent 
management. In FY2024, total assets 
rose by 3.9% to RM21,315.32 million, 
reflecting our ability to generate 
and retain value. Concurrently, 
total liabilities grew by 4.7% to 
RM9,996.47 million, demonstrating 
our strategic use of leverage to 
finance growth initiatives. This 
balanced increase in both assets and 
liabilities underscores our capacity 
to invest in future opportunities  
while maintaining a stable financial 
position.
Total borrowings grew by 3.2% to 
RM5,534.30 million by the end of 
FY2024, with 31.3% due within 
the next 12 months. The Group 
has sufficient fund-based facilities, 
bank balances, and deposits to 
meet its debt obligations as they 
become due, reinforcing our strong 
liquidity position. Foreign currency 
borrowings, which comprise a 
quarter of total borrowings, are 
predominantly long-term and used 
to finance the Group’s overseas 
projects.
In October 2023, RAM Ratings 
reaffirmed the Company’s RM3.0 
billion Sukuk Murabahah Programme 
with a rating of ‘AA3/Stable’. In 
addition, RAM Ratings has assigned 
respective AA3(s) and P1(s) ratings 
to the Group’s established funding 
vehicle, IJM Treasury Management 
Sdn Bhd’s proposed Islamic  
Medium-Term Notes Programme 
and Islamic Commercial Papers 
Programme with a combined limit of 
RM5.0 billion.
By the end of the financial year, 
the Group’s net assets per 
share increased to RM2.91, up 
from RM2.80 the previous year. 
Corresponding with the rise in total 
borrowings, the Group’s net gearing 
ratio slightly increased to 26.1% as  
of 31 March 2024, compared to 
25.8% the previous year. The current 
low net gearing ratio provides us  
with ample headroom to fund 
new projects and seize growth 
opportunities.
As of 31 March 2024, total capital 
commitments of the Group 
amounted to RM254.45 million. 
Purchases of property, plant, and 
equipment constituted 72.8% of 
these commitments, primarily related 
to the Industry Division’s purchase 
of a new factory and other asset 
enhancements. 
“ Our strong financial 
results, driven by the 
robust performance of 
our business divisions, 
affirm the strategic 
direction and initiatives 
adopted by the Group 
to steer ahead as a 
market leader in each 
of our businesses.”

ManageMent DisCUssion anD analysis
Our net operational cash inflows 
remained robust at RM1,159.53 
million in FY2024, reflecting our 
operational efficiency and the 
positive impact of our expanded 
operations. Investing activities cash 
outflow saw an increase of 85.3% 
to RM294.73 million. This rise was 
due to expenditures on purchases 
of property, plant, and equipment, 
right-of-use assets and investment 
properties to expand our business 
activities. We aim to optimise our 
investment approach and balance 
our capital allocation while preserving 
cash flow for future initiatives. 
Net cash flow used in financing 
activities saw lower outflows in 
FY2024 mainly due to higher 
repayment of borrowings in the 
previous year. Overall, closing cash 
and cash equivalents of the Group 
improved marginally to RM2,845.75 
million as of 31 March 2024 from a 
year ago. 
To maintain sufficient liquidity and 
cash flow for managing working  
capital and meeting financial 
obligations, the Group enforces 
stringent credit terms and debt 
collection policies. We also prioritise 
effective credit utilisation to maintain  
a comfortable leverage level, 
alongside continuous financial 
planning efforts.
Dividends
The Company is committed to the 
payment of annual dividends. The 
quantum of dividends is determined 
after taking into account, inter alia, 
the Company’s performance, level of 
available funds, amount of retained 
earnings, capital expenditure 
commitments and other investment 
planning requirements. 
For FY2024, the Company declared 
a single tier second interim dividend  
of 5 sen per share and a special 
dividend of 1 sen per share, both 
paid on 19 July 2024. Combined 
with a single tier first interim dividend 
of 2 sen per share paid earlier on  
29 December 2023, the total 
dividends declared for this financial 
year amounted to 8 sen per share 
totalling RM280.49 million.
In FY2023, the Company paid a single 
tier first interim dividend of 2 sen per 
share on 30 December 2022 and a 
single tier second interim dividend of 
4 sen per share, along with a special 
dividend of 2 sen per share, on  
21 July 2023. Total dividends 
declared were 8 sen per share.
IJM’s consistent dividend payments 
reflect its robust financial health and 
commitment to returning value to its 
shareholders.

better outlook across all our divisions. 
Prospects for the Construction 
Division are anchored by a healthy 
order book of RM6.0 billion as of  
31 March 2024 and coming on  
stream of large-scale public 
infrastructure and industrial property 
projects. The Property Division, in 
the meantime, expects to benefit 
from steady pipeline of mixed-
range products and unbilled sales of  
RM2.6 billion as of 31 March 2024. 
The Industry Division achieved a 
record-high financial performance 
in FY2024 with a sustainable spun  
piles order book of around five  
months or approximately 900,000 MT 
as of 31 March 2024, with improving 
margins. In addition to that, traffic 
volume at the Toll Division has 
recovered to pre-pandemic levels for 
NPE and BESRAYA with a possible 
brownfield extension of these toll 
highways. Promising traffic growth 
is observed at LEKAS highway. 
The concessions of BESRAYA and 
LEKAS have been restructured, 
and the restructuring of NPE is now 
in advanced negotiations with the 
government. Upon completion, 
IJM will own three highways with 
established traffic patterns and 
renewed concession periods, 
creating opportunities for potential 
value realisation.
The Port Division is experiencing 
rising cargo throughput from 
improving regional activity and 
expanding clientele as well as 
sizeable opportunities due to growing 
investments in the Malaysia-China 
Kuantan Industrial Park (“MCKIP”). 
The tariff revisions implemented since 
April 2023 will auger well for future 
growth. In the longer term, Kuantan 
Port is well-positioned for further 
brownfield expansion following 
the successful implementation of  
Phase 1A of the New Deep Water 
Terminal. Further capacity expansion 
is vital to serve the oncoming  
sizeable foreign direct investments 
in nearby industrial parks. Notably, 
Alliance Steel Sdn Bhd, the current 
largest investor at MCKIP , is planning 
its Phase 2 plant expansion. Based 
on this, the division is planning 
capital expenditure requirements to 
cater to the sizeable uplift in future 
cargo volumes at the port.
The construction of the highly 
acclaimed integrated waterfront 
development, The Light City, Penang 
is ongoing. This mixed-development 
project, undertaken via a joint 
venture with Singapore developer 
Perennial Holdings Private Limited, 
will be a major investment property 
for the Group when completed.  
The project is planned under  
two phases. Phase 1 will consist  
of a 340,000 sq ft convention  
centre, a 1 million sq ft GFA retail 
mall, 34-storey hotels (4 - and 5 - star)  
and office towers, as well as a 
luxurious residential tower, Mezzo.

BUSINESS STRATEGY 
The Group’s Strategic Focus— Drive Growth, Build Resilience, Nurture Capabilities—initiated in early 2020, proved 
crucial in navigating the pandemic period. With the onset of a global recovery, we have shifted our priorities towards the  
Group’s “Drive Growth” agenda of the Group Strategic Focus for the financial years 2023–2025.
The	Group’s	Strategic	Focus	for	FY2023	–	FY2025

The first phase is targeted to  
complete progressively from Q1 
2025. Phase 2 will consist of another 
500,000 sq ft retail mall (which 
totals to a 1.5 million sq ft GFA, 
making it the largest retail mall in 
Penang), a commercial tower, and a 
second luxurious residential tower,  
Lightwater Residences.
While our core business divisions 
continue to drive organic growth, 
the Group has ventured into new 
synergistic businesses, particularly 
in logistics. The Group has invested 
in the EXIO Logistics hubs in  
Shah Alam, and in Global Vision 
Logistics Sdn Bhd (“GVL”), which  
is developing the Shah Alam 
International Logistics Hub (“SAILH”),  
one of ASEAN’s largest logistics 
hub of six million sq ft and the 
first green certified logistics hub 
in Malaysia. These investments 
are spurred by strategic moves to 
address the increasing demands of 
the logistics sector that is riding on 
the e-commerce growth wave and 
supply chain diversification. These 
developments will enhance the 
Group’s position in the industrial real 
estate market. The Group established 
its first green bond to fund the EXIO 
Logistics project in April 2024.
The Group is also expanding its 
geographical footprint in East 
Malaysia, UK, Indonesia and India. In 
East Malaysia, the Group is currently 
working to secure some projects 
allocated by the Malaysian Budget 
2023 for Sabah (RM6.5 billion) and 
Sarawak (RM5.6 billion). During 
FY2024, we secured The Rembus 
Depot and Associated Works for 
the Kuching Urban Transportation 
System which houses the hydrogen-
powered smart tram, Autonomous 
Rapid Transit (ART). 
The road infrastructure opportunities 
in India are very promising with the 
National Highways Authority of India 
(NHAI) set to roll out new BOT tenders 
totalling RM111 billion over the next 
few years. The Group is leveraging its 
extensive experience in India, where 
it has operated since 1998, to secure 
projects in the road infrastructure 
sector as the country recently 
completed its general election.
As we move forward, we remain 
dedicated to capitalising on growth 
opportunities and enhancing 
shareholder value.
Build Resilience 
During FY2024, the Group recorded 
a strong financial performance 
despite moderate economic growth 
globally and domestically. EBITDA 
and PBT increased by 47.8% 
and 99.6% to RM1,572.28 million 
(FY2023: RM1,063.99 million) and 
964.17 million (FY2023: RM483.03 
million) respectively, supported 
by improved performances by 
our business divisions. These 
financial achievements reinforce our 
confidence in our business model 
and strategic direction. 
It is the Group’s practice to ensure 
that there is always sufficient liquidity 
and cash flow to meet our financial 
obligations. Improving economic 
activities across major sectors in 
FY2024 has enabled the Group 
to sustain healthy operating cash 
flow at above the RM1.0 billion 
level for the fifth consecutive year. 
Simultaneously, we focused on 
managing capital expenditures 
and optimising working capital to 
strengthen our balance sheet. Our 
deposits, cash and bank balances at 
the year-end stood higher at RM2.87 
billion (FY2023: RM2.83 billion). 
To participate in the development 
of the new administrative capital 
of Nusantara in Indonesia, IJM 
has submitted a proposal to the 
Indonesian Government to build 
20 towers of public servants 
apartments with smart building 
features incorporating digitalisation, 
integrated building management 
system and green building 
development concepts. The proposal 
is currently under assessment.
In the UK, the Property Division 
is leveraging on the successful 
development of the Royal Mint 
Gardens in London. The division is 
partnering Network Rail Property to 
seek development opportunities on 
land adjacent to railway infrastructure 
and through oversite developments 
in the UK. The partnership has 
identified eight sites in Central 
London and its inner suburbs to 
be explored for development into 
mixed-use schemes, residential, 
commercial or logistics properties. 
Detailed infrastructure and enabling 
design works are currently underway. 
Consultation and engagement with 
key stakeholders and planning 
authorities on the regeneration 
schemes will occur throughout 2025.  
The division has recently acquired 
an 11-acre brownfield site known 
as The Wheat Quarter (North Side) 
strategically located in Welwyn 
Garden City, a key commuter 
town in Hertfordshire County,  
for a residential-led mixed-used 
development. The development is 
strategically located adjacent to the 
Welwyn Garden City train station 
and connected to a mature shopping 
area as well as major retailers by a 
footbridge, it ensures easy access 
to London, with King’s Cross Station 
just 28 minutes away by train.
“ While our core business divisions continue to drive organic growth, the  
Group has ventured into new synergistic businesses, particularly in logistics.”

capital management activities, 
payment of dividends to shareholders,

capital and incidental expenses.  
In FY2024, the total share buyback 
of 6,735,800 shares at an average 
price of RM1.51 totalling RM10.19 
million is yielding significant benefits 
at current market prices. 
The Group will remain vigilant 
and prudent in our management 
approach, ensuring business and 
financial resilience as we navigate 
the highly demanding business 
environment.
Nurture Capabilities
As part of our commitment to 
nurturing capabilities, we have made 
considerable investments in this area. 
In FY2024, IJM continued to enhance 
its digital transformation journey in 
its businesses and strengthen its 
digital backbone, the SAP system. 
Additionally, the Group continues 
to focus on key innovation areas for 
FY2023 – FY2025, under three pillars: 
enhancing process automation and 
workplace modernisation, increasing 
digital insights and analytics, and 
developing a competitive business 
advantage.
Our sustainability initiatives have 
advanced significantly following 
the implementation of the Group 
Sustainability Roadmap for FY2023 – 
FY2025, bolstering our efforts in the 
areas of Marketplace, Environment, 
Workplace, and Community. With our 
commitment to achieving net-zero 
carbon emissions by 2050, we are 
focusing on taking actions to address 
the evolving risks and opportunities 
associated with climate change as 
well as pursue green credentials. 
Furthermore, our Community 
Investment framework and strategy 
is aligning our community efforts 
across the Group. More details 
of our progress can be found in  
the Sustainability Statement on 
pages 128 to 215. 
Throughout FY2024, we remained 
committed to enhancing the Group’s 
compliance and risk management 
framework. This included ongoing 
assessments of divisional and 
departmental risk profiles, along 
with our annual review of the Anti-
Bribery and Corruption System. 
More information on these efforts 
is detailed in the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control on 
pages 116 to 125.
We are dedicated to developing our 
workforce capabilities by promoting 
a performance-oriented culture 
through the Group’s performance 
management system and business 
strategies by aligning rewards 
with performance. Additionally, we 
prioritise robust assessments to 
identify future leaders as part of our 
succession planning efforts.
However, the net gearing increased 
slightly to 26.1% from 25.8% a 
year ago, due to higher borrowings 
of RM5.53 billion in FY2024  
(FY2023: 5.36 billion) to fund our 
business operations. 
The Group has consistently taken 
proactive measures to decrease 
its completed property inventory, 
progressively reducing it over the 
years to RM738.15 million (FY2023), 
from RM865.42 million (FY2022), 
and RM1,150.90 million (FY2021). As 
of FY2024, the balance completed 
property inventory was RM908.71 
million, primarily due to the inclusion 
of newly available commercial 
office in Changchun, China valued 
at RM339.20 million. The Property 
Division will continue to implement 
strategies to market and sell these 
inventories effectively to maintain low 
inventory levels.
Following the Group’s divestment of 
our 56.2% stake in IJM Plantations 
in FY2022, the Group has realigned 
its businesses to concentrate on 
the Construction, Property, Industry 
and Infrastructure Divisions, thereby 
gaining synergistic benefits. The 
net proceeds of RM1.53 billion  
from the disposal strengthened  
IJM’s balance sheet and as of  
31 March 2024, these funds have  
been fully deployed to various 
investments, capital expenditure, 
“ With our commitment 
to achieving net-zero 
carbon emissions by 
2050, we are focusing 
on taking actions to 
address the evolving 
risks and opportunities 
associated with 
climate change as 
well as pursue green 
credentials.”

Projects
Furthermore, the division continued 
to secure in-house construction 
projects within our established 
townships such as The Light Penang, 
IJM Rimbayu, and Seremban 2. 
These townships are expected to 
consistently generate new projects 
for the division, supporting its 
sustainable business growth.
Internationally, the division is actively 
pursuing new opportunities through 
aggressive tendering activities in

Challenges
The Construction Division faced 
challenges throughout the financial 
year, particularly with ongoing work 
on delayed sections of the WCE  
that extended into the current 
financial year from the prior 
COVID-19 period. These delays were 
due to land acquisition matters and 
delays in approvals that significantly 
affected the division’s overall margin 
contributions.
Despite these challenges, the division 
remains optimistic due to a strong 
order book totalling RM6.0 billion  
as of 31 March 2024 and anticipated 
higher construction activities from 
ongoing projects. This positions the 
division for potential profit margin 
recovery and improved performance 
in the future.
ongoing in-house projects in India. In 
January 2024, the NHAI announced 
plans to initiate 49 new BOT projects 
totalling Rs. 1.98 Lakh crores (RM111 
billion) over the coming years, 
presenting promising opportunities 
for our operations in India.
In FY2024, the division successfully 
completed several local projects, 
including a government building in 
Penang, a 5-storey industrial and 
office building in Batu Kawan. For 
infrastructure projects, the division 
has completed Sections 1, 2 and 6 of 
the West Coast Expressway (“WCE”) 
in Selangor, along with Section 11 
in Perak. Additionally, in India, the 
division completed a commercial 
shops project in Nagpur.

During FY2024, the division achieved 
a revenue of RM1,675.56 million 
(FY2023: RM1,069.91 million) and 
profit before tax of RM36.81 million 
(FY2023: RM90.98 million). The 
decline in profit was primarily due to 
losses recognised from three ongoing 
projects affected by changes in work 
scope, increases in building material 
prices, and prolongation costs whilst 
potential claims are being pursued. 
These prolongation costs were 
caused by the extended construction 
period to complete four sections of 
the WCE, coupled with material price 
escalations for concrete and quarry 
products and higher transportation 
costs, which elevated the overall 
construction costs. Additionally, new 
projects are currently in their initial 
construction stages, where no profit 
has been recognised yet.
ISO Certifications and 
Digitalisation Initiatives
During the financial year, the 
division successfully retained its 
ISO 45001 and 14001 certifications, 
demonstrating adherence to 
the highest standards of health, 
safety, and environmental (“HSE”) 
performance across all its projects. 
The division also maintains a 
robust risk management process, 
involving thorough identification and 
assessment at both divisional and 
operational levels. This system allows 
our projects to mitigate potential 
risks through early intervention and 
incorporate pre-emptive actions 
into our business processes for 
continuous improvement.

FY2024. Digitalisation has reduced

customer feedback, which is crucial 
in assessing our performance and 
fostering continuous improvement.

Building Information Modelling 
(“BIM”) remains a key driver for the 
division, enabling more efficient, 
sustainable, and collaborative project 
delivery. Looking ahead, the division 
is dedicated to fully leveraging BIM’s 
potential to foster innovation, create 
value, and effect positive change in 
the built environment.
Additional information about 
the division’s initiatives and  
non-financial performance can be 
found in the Sustainability Statement 
on pages 128 to 215.
The market outlook for Malaysia’s 
construction sector is optimistic, 
driven by strong demand for 
industrial buildings related to the 
semiconductor industry, data 
centres, warehouses, and logistics 
hubs over the next few years. This 
growing demand is expected to 
boost construction activities in the 
domestic market.
Public infrastructure projects like the 
LRT Penang, roadworks in Sabah 
and Sarawak, and various flood 
mitigation initiatives are anticipated 
to drive the construction industry in 
the coming year. 
With the Malaysian and Indian 
economies expected to show 
improvements in the coming year, 
the division must stay vigilant and 
responsive to risks, especially 
those related to the supply chain 
and fluctuations in material prices. 
Additionally, it is crucial to maintain 
expertise in managing major and 
complex building projects while 
fostering synergies with the Group’s 
other business divisions. The 
division is optimistic about securing 
additional projects in the upcoming 
financial year.

The residential sub-sector continued 
to lead the overall property market, 
with 62.8% contribution in volume 
and 51.3% in value. The residential 
overhang situation improved with 
overhang residential properties 
declining to 25,816 units or RM17.68 
billion in value compared to 27,746 
units worth RM18.41 billion in 2022.
Although the market showed signs  
of recovery, the homebuyers’ 
sentiment remained cautious due to 
concerns over global geo-political 
stability, economic challenges, a 
weakened Malaysian Ringgit and 
inflation-led high cost of living.
Against this backdrop, the division 
recorded a higher revenue of 
RM2,029.27 million, an increase 
of 25.6% from RM1,615.22 million 
recorded a year earlier, on the back 
of strong sales of RM2.37 billion 
achieved in FY2024 and higher 
work progress achieved for the 
division’s ongoing developments. 
Profit before tax increased slightly by 
6.6% to RM390.97 million (FY2023: 
RM366.75 million) mainly due to 
higher profits recorded in FY2023 
because of a major cost finalisation 
exercise for completed projects. 
PBT for FY2024 also included an 
unrealised foreign exchange gain 
of RM49.2 million, compared to an 
unrealised foreign exchange loss of 
RM2.7 million in FY2023.
Innovative Products. Strong 
Market Interest
During the financial year, the division’s

The newly launched commercial 
projects, namely The Promenade 
in IJM Rimbayu, Nexus Phase 1

IJM Bayouri in Jawi, Penang, 
experienced strong buying interest.

It is poised to become Penang’s

an area of over 330,000 square feet  
and is set to play a pivotal role 
in shaping the socio-economic 
landscape of Penang. Together 
with a 1 million sq ft GFA retail mall, 
34-storey hotels (4 - and 5 - star) and 
office towers, as well as a luxurious

The division continues to place 
emphasis on delivering quality 
excellence in its developments 
through the QLASSIC assessment, 
to consistently deliver high quality 
products that meet industry 
standards and best practices. The 
division has set a target of achieving 
a minimum QLASSIC score of 
80% for every IJM Land residential 
development. On 19 September 
2023, the division received the High 
QLASSIC Achievement Award at 
the Safety & Health, Environment, 
and Quality (SHEQ) DAY 2023, for 
achieving an average QLASSIC  
score of 86% and 83% for the  
Austin Duta Phase 10B and Nasa City 
Phase 3 respectively in Johor Bahru.
The division remains committed to 
promoting sustainable designs in 
IJM Land properties and ensuring 
all properties in Malaysia are green-
certified. One of our sustainable 
practices, the ‘Say Yes to 4R’ initiative 
has been instrumental in promoting 
sustainability across our projects 
and townships to minimise our 
environmental footprint and enhance 
liveability in our developments. 
The high take-up was primarily 
attributed to the attractiveness of 
the division’s product offerings and 
its strategic location with good 
connectivity and accessibility.  
In addition to the division’s current 
ongoing developments, there 
are some notable projects in the 
pipeline including the mixed-use 
developments in Pantai Sentral Park, 
Kuala Lumpur and The Light City, 
Penang. 
In the coming financial year, 
the division will launch its first 
commercial development ‘Enlace’ in 
Pantai Sentral Park, Kuala Lumpur, 
encompassing retail spaces, offices, 
and serviced apartments. The 
Penang Waterfront Convention 
Centre (PWCC) at The Light City, 
Penang, a joint venture project 
between IJM Corporation Berhad 
and Perennial Holdings Private 
Limited, is making great progress.

Market Recognition
To attract eco-conscious home 
buyers, the division has embarked 
on a strategic tie-up with OCBC 
Bank (Malaysia) and Alliance Bank to 
promote sustainable living through a 
‘Green Home Ownership Programme’ 
that rewards purchasers for their 
ESG orientation. The collaborations 
set out to encourage and enable 
prospective homebuyers to make 
environmentally conscious decisions 
by purchasing or investing in green-
certified properties developed by 
the division, thereby lowering their 
carbon footprint and ownership costs.
Our commitment to product 
excellence sets us apart from our 
competitors. The development of 
high-quality homes and spaces 
that transcend generations not only 
enabled the division to attract new 
buyers and foster loyalty but also won 
market recognitions. The division 
was accorded various key industrial 
awards and accolades, including 
recognition as a top developer 
in Malaysia at the Edge Malaysia 
Property Excellence Awards, BCI 
Asia Awards (Malaysia), MDA Awards 
and the StarProperty Awards. The 
division was also adjudged as one 
of the top brands in the Property 
Development category of the Putra 
Brand Awards.
The division’s developments, 
Seremban 2, Sebana Cove and 
Mezzo @ The Light City were winners 
of the individual property category 
at the StarProperty Awards. Its 
overseas project, the Royal Mint 
Gardens in London, won The Edge 
Malaysia Outstanding Overseas 
Project Award. Meanwhile, Saujana 
Duta, the luxury development in S2 
Heights, Seremban, was recognised 
at the Malaysia Property Award™ 
2023 in the Residential Low-
Rise Category. These accolades 
have reinforced and bolstered the 
reputation and achievements of the 
division, solidifying our standing as 
both a brand and a game changer in 
the industry.

to deliver up to 3.55 million square 
feet of development, encompassing 
a mix of housing, life sciences, 
student accommodation and various 
commercial spaces for offices and 
logistics. In addition, the division has 
also acquired The Wheat Quarter site

Johor, key industrial projects in the 
northern region and  Pan Borneo 
Highway projects in Sabah and 
Sarawak. All these are expected 
to generate growth potential 
opportunities throughout the country 
and the division remains cautiously 
optimistic about the property market 
in Malaysia. 
Value creation through enhancing 
brand recognition, innovation, and 
product differentiation continues 
to be the focus of the division. 
Its unwavering commitment to 
sustainability, quality, and innovation 
remains at the core of its operations 
as the division strives to deliver

increased by 19.5% to RM181.79

14.8% to RM235.72 million. 
Remarkable Growth for PHC Piles
The PHC piles business experienced 
a remarkable growth compared to 
FY2023, with sales revenue increasing 
by 27.5% to reach RM932.14 million 
and PBT increasing by 47.3% to 
RM206.88 million. Sales tonnage 
surged to 1.73 million tonnes, marking 
a commendable 20.4% increase 
from the previous financial year and 
emphasising steadfast dedication to 
efficiency and operational excellence. 
This demonstrates the division’s 
ability to adapt to market dynamics 
and capitalise on opportunities, 
positioning the division for continued 
success and expansion in the future.
The division’s exceptional 
performance was due to a strong 
recovery of the construction 
industry and increased investments, 
especially in logistics warehouses, 
factories and data centres. The 
revival of infrastructure projects, 
particularly in the central region, and 
the gradual recovery of the property 
sector also contributed to its growth.

value to customers by continuously 
evolving our products through 
innovation and technology and to 
navigate through the everchanging 
landscape, while building strong 
and enduring partnerships with 
stakeholders, including customers 
and overseas agents, to drive 
sustainable growth and success.
To reduce dependency on foreign 
labour and optimise costs through 
advanced automation, a new plant 
will be built at Bestari Jaya. This 
plant is designed to produce higher 
outputs with less manpower and be 
able to capitalise on cheaper supply 
of raw materials available nearby. 
Continuous initiatives for production 
efficiency and cost optimisation 
saw the Nilai factory upgrading the 
production line. It resulted in an 
increase in capacity by 30.0% for 
higher efficiency and cost savings. 
Increased usage of alternative 
cementitious replacement materials 
has generated savings of RM4.60 
million. Solar panel installations for 
the remaining two factories in Klang 
and Kuantan were completed with 
capacities of 1.16MWp and 324KWp 
respectively. This brings the total 
rooftop solar installed capacity to 
6.8MWp.
The Research and Development 
Department’s study on new cement 
substitute materials in accordance 
with BS EN standard requirements 
has been verified and implemented 
in various concrete mixes from ready 
mixed concrete products to spun 
concrete piles products. This has 
resulted in new achievements in 
concrete workability performance in 
pump mixes.
The division is optimistic of  
emerging business opportunities, 
particularly in warehouse and data 
centre projects as well as in other 
export markets such as the Middle 
East, particularly Saudi Arabia, 
present avenues for growth and 
expansion. Mega projects from 
Singapore, such as the Wuxi Apptex 
Pharmaceutical Plant at Tuas and the 
Megayard project, offer promising 
opportunities for export revenue.
To mitigate risks and capitalise on 
new growth avenues, the division 
is actively exploring new export 
markets, with a focus in the Middle 
East, including Saudi Arabia. Efforts 
to enhance the division’s market 
share in existing markets are 
underway, bolstering our resilience 
and competitive edge.
The division aims to stay ahead of

IJMIBS Makes Significant Strides
From the onset of FY2024, IJM IBS 
Sdn Bhd (“IJMIBS”) made significant 
strides by securing numerous 
contracts with its SMART IBS 
solution, particularly the BubbleDeck 
Slab solution. These contracts span 
a diverse array of building projects, 
ranging from educational institutions 
to semiconductor facilities, data 
centres, and more. The adoption of 
the BubbleDeck solution not only 
facilitated our clients’ transition 
towards sustainable construction 
practices but also greatly expedited 
construction timelines.  
In the fourth quarter of FY2024, 
the division secured prominent 
projects such as the Infineon Multi-
Story Carpark in Kulim, Kedah; 
Immigration, Custom & Quarantine 
Complex between Johor Bahru and 
Singapore (RTS); and Hospital Kapar, 
Selangor. These contracts serve 
as a testament to the effectiveness 
of the SMART IBS solution as a 
game-changer for clients in various 
sectors. Looking ahead, the division 
anticipates continuous demand 
for innovative solutions within the 
construction industry.
In July 2023, the division acquired 
100% of IJM Building Systems Sdn 
Bhd (“IJMBS”) with more flexibility 
to provide IBS solutions in the 
construction of central living quarters, 
mould repairs, and engineering works 
for ICP factories. This move will 
reduce our dependency on external 
contractors and save costs.

Quarry	Business	Improves
Sales volume in the quarrying sector 
improved by 15.5% compared to 
the previous financial year. Supply 
of ballast to the ECRL project by the 
Pahang based quarries contributed 
to the hike. The newly commenced 
Raub quarry which started operations 
on 2 May 2023, also had a part in the 
hike. 
Junjung Quarry, witnessed a dip in 
sales volume and profit by 7.9% and 
22.3% respectively when compared 
to the previous year. This was 
attributed to competition resulting in 
downward price adjustments.
In East Coast Peninsular Malaysia, 
sales volume of crusher run and 
ballast from Panching quarry to 
ECRL project increased by 30.3%, 
compared to the previous year. 
Gebeng quarry’s supply volume 
increased by 54.0% and its loss 
reduced by 87.5% compared to 
the previous year. It was mainly for 
supplying 20mm aggregate for in-
house consumption and crusher run 
to the ECRL project. 
Overall, the quarry turnover improved 
by 23.9% compared to last year due 
to higher prices and sales volumes 
from central and east coast regions. 
Consequently, quarrying activities 
recorded a PBT of RM11.39 million 
before impairment and write-offs.

The sales volume of Strong Mixed 
Concrete Sdn Bhd increased by 
11.3% from 289,284 m 3 in the 
previous year to 321,966 m 3. The 
increase was due to the supply to The 
Light City project that encompasses 
a convention centre, hotel and office 
block and ASE projects, Penang. 
In tandem, turnover increased by 
19.1% from RM69.6 million in the 
previous year to RM82.9 million due 
to higher sales volume and prices.

A PBT of RM2.24 million was 
registered for FY2024.
The performance of ready mixed 
concrete in India was mixed. Only  
two plants reflected higher sales 
volume compared to FY2023. In 
Mumbai, sales volume bettered 
previous year by 4.6%, with 
supplies used for an educational 
institution, commercial complexes 
and residential projects; while in 
Bangalore, sales volume improved 
by 10.0% with the rollout of property 
development and residential  
projects. Overall, sales volume 
increased marginally by 1.5% to 
385,450 m 3  but turnover registered 
an increase of 7.6% to RM110.12 
million. Coupled with bad debts 
recovery of RM1.5 million, PBT 
improved by RM1.73 million to 
RM3.85 million compared to RM2.12 
million recorded the previous year.
The quarry business was affected 
by competition and state elections. 
Sales volume and the average 
selling price dropped by 5.7% and 
9.7% respectively. Consequently,  
it recorded a lower turnover of 
RM17.55 million compared to 
RM19.48 million the previous year. 
We recorded a marginal PBT of 
RM0.02 million. 
Scaffold Master Doubles PBT
Turnover at Scaffold Master Sdn  
Bhd increased by 21.3% to 
RM13.6 million. This was attributed 
to contributions from new and 
ongoing projects. Coupled with 
lower depreciation charge, which 
decreased by RM1 million, PBT 
almost doubled from the previous 
year to RM2.99 million. 
Additional information about 
the division’s initiatives and  
non-financial performance can be 
found in the Sustainability Statement  
on pages 128 to 215.
The division will continue to uphold 
high standards in every facet of its 
operations and strategic execution. 
While the piles business continues 
to drive growth, the division is also 
venturing into new geographical  
areas and new business 
opportunities. It is the division’s 
primary goal to achieve sustainable 
growth and create long term value  
for stakeholders as well as to 
collaborate with other divisions for 
synergistic opportunities that will 
drive the division to greater heights.

Dewas Bypass Tollway, Madhya Pradesh, India
The Infrastructure-Toll Division’s 
asset portfolio comprises eight toll 
road concessions:  four in Malaysia, 
three in India, and one in Argentina.
During FY2024, the Infrastructure-Toll 
Division recorded a slight decrease  
in revenue by 6.1% to RM519.55 
million compared to RM553.19 
million the previous year. This was 
mainly due to the restructuring 
exercise of the BESRAYA highway, 
which involved a lower toll rate and  
a longer concession period.
The division, however, recorded a 
profit before tax of RM128.31 million 
compared to a loss of RM176.98 
million the previous year. This was 
due to the absence of the prior year’s 
higher maintenance (resurfacing) 
costs and RM133.5 million of 
expected credit losses pursuant 
to a financial instrument related to 
West Coast Expressway (“WCE”). 
Additionally, there was a lower 
unrealised foreign exchange loss 
of RM27.0 million on its US Dollar 
denominated borrowings for its 
Indian operations (FY2023: RM68.7 
million loss).

In terms of total traffic, BESRAYA, 
NPE and LEKAS recorded a marginal 
uptrend of 1.2% compared to 
FY2023. It was the highest record 
of Annual Average Daily Traffic 
(“AADT”) of 471,800. However, total 
toll revenue for FY2024 decreased 
by 11.9%, from RM397.04 million 
to RM349.90 million mainly due to 
lower toll revenues at BESRAYA and 
LEKAS following the concession 
restructuring exercise with the 
Government on 30 December 2022. 
The lower toll revenues contributed  
to lower PBT, which decreased 
19.3% from RM138.42 million to 
RM111.67 million in FY2024. 
BESRAYA	Concession	Extended	to	
2046; Toll Rate Reduction
Following the completion of 
the concession restructuring 
for BESRAYA pursuant to the 
Supplemental Concession 
Agreement (“SCA”) dated 30 
from 203,900 in the prior year.  
New developments sprouting along 
the highway vicinity have resulted 
in rising traffic demand which kept 
NPE on a steady traffic growth path. 
Coupled with higher toll revenue and 
other operating income in FY2024, 
NPE’s pre-tax profit rose 6.1% to 
RM96.14 million. 
LEKAS Concession and Debt 
Restructuring	Exercises	
Similar to BESRAYA, LEKAS had 
restructured their concession on 30 
December 2022 that encompassed 
a toll rate reduction effective 1 
January 2023 and an extension to 
the concession period by 25 years 
till 2064. The Group has ceased 
sharing the losses of LEKAS,  
which was accounted up to its cost  
of investment. If not, the Group’s 
December 2022, in exchange for toll 
rate reduction of 26%, BESRAYA’s 
concession period was extended 
by 6 years to 2046. As a result, 
BESRAYA’s revenue decreased 
24.2%, from RM163.28 million to 
RM123.73 million in FY2024. Its 
pre-tax profit dropped from  
RM70.67 million to RM35.17 
million in FY2024. The AADT 
traffic performance, however, was 
maintained at 164,000 in FY2024 
due to its mature highway profile 
despite competition from new 
competing road alignments and 
public transportation. 
NPE	Experiences	Record	AADT
In FY2024, NPE demonstrated 
commendable performance, 
achieving a revenue of RM179.84 
million, reflecting a 3.2% increase 
from FY2023. This growth was 
supported by a record AADT of 
204,500 vehicles, which improved 
BESRAYA Eastern extension

share of losses would have been 
RM19.63 million (FY2023: RM22.87 
million) during the period. Revenue 
share would have been RM46.32 
million in FY2024, a decrease of 
22.1% from RM59.45 million last year 
due to lower toll rates. 
LEKAS continued to show robust 
traffic growth of 6% compared to the 
previous year, mainly due to higher 
occupancy housing developments 
around Semenyih and Kajang Selatan 
that boosted short haul traffic. 
New link roads and an interchange 
also improved road connectivity 
between new development projects 
to LEKAS. 
In FY2024, LEKAS successfully 
restructured its Redeemable 
Convertible Secured Islamic Debt 
Securities (RCSIDS) and Junior Sukuk 
with a longer tenure of Tawarruq 
Asset Financing facility totalling 
RM1.0 billion. On 30 November 2023, 
LEKAS signed another Supplemental 
Concession Agreement with the 
Government for the restructuring 
of Reimbursable Land Cost facility 
amounting to RM300 million. These 
exercises have lengthened LEKAS’s 
debt repayment profile to better 
match its traffic projections and  
cash flows. 
Continuous Improvement 
Initiatives
The Infrastructure-Toll Division 
remains committed to managing 
its customers’ expectations by  
implementing continuous improvement 
initiatives. The division prioritises 
the safety and wellbeing of all road 
users, by fostering a safer and more 
accommodating travel environment 
along its highways. During FY2024, 
the division’s highways have been 
certified with global standards of 
Occupational Health and Safety 
Management Systems (ISO 
45011:2018), in recognition of its 
efforts and initiatives to safeguard 
the health and safety of its workforce.

By undertaking extensive periodical 
inspections and preventive 
maintenance, the division ensures 
a more proactive and long-term 
approach to maintenance works and 
asset preservation, which enables 
optimal allocation of resources. 
Traffic snarls in the Kuala Lumpur  
city centre and surrounding areas  
have become worse than  
pre-pandemic levels despite having 
a better public transportation 
system and new improved road 
networks. Hence, traffic congestion 
management during peak hours 
remains as one of the most significant 
challenges while managing the 
expectations of highways’ users. 
Managing Traffic Congestion, 
Safety and Convenience
For long term traffic mitigation and 
environmental measures, NPE has 
proposed a highway extension 
project, NPE2, as a traffic dispersal 
scheme to alleviate congestion 
in Bangsar, a densely populated 
commercial-residential suburb. The 
project has been adopted as one of 
the traffic management strategies 
in the Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan  
2040 and NPE2 will serve as 
the highway connector between 
BESRAYA, NPE and DUKE 2A 
upon completion. Through this 
multifaceted proposal, we can foster 
a transportation network that is not 
only efficient but also prioritises the 
wellbeing and safety of road users.
Constant monitoring and close 
collaboration with third party project 
owners along the highway corridors 
are crucial to ensure strict adherence 
to road safety guidelines and operating 
procedures, as ongoing projects may 
adversely affect the traffic flow or 
road users’ safety. Throughout the 
year, several significant development 
projects have progressed well along 
the highways’ corridor, including the 
completion of Mass Rapid Transit 
(MRT, Putrajaya Line Phase 2) on 16 
March 2023, Sungai Besi-Ulu Kelang 
Expressway (SUKE) on 16 June 2023, 
Setiawangsa-Pantai Expressway 
(SPE) on 3 November 2023, and 
the Langat 2 water treatment plant 
project. 
With customer safety, comfort and 
convenience as the division’s top 
priority, it has enhanced the level of 
service with the upgrading of rest and 
service areas, laybys, toll plazas and 
ancillary facilities, as well as initiating 
new technological and service 
innovations. 
To meet the increasing demands 
for public amenities, BESRAYA 
has refurbished the layby facilities 
at KM0.9; and NPE completed 
the refurbishment works of public 
amenities at PJS2 and PJS5 Toll 
Plaza; whereas LEKAS has planned 
for the upgrading of laybys and rest 
service areas in the coming year.
The implementation of the Open 
Payment Toll Collection System 
(“OPS”) for BESRAYA and NPE was 
inaugurated by the Works Minister 
YB Dato Sri Alexander Nanta Linggi 
at the Loke Yew Toll Plaza on 29 
September 2023. This initiative 
allows highway users to pay the 
toll fees seamlessly through various 
digital payment methods such as 
credit/debit cards, enhancing user 
convenience, reducing congestion at 
the toll plazas and ensuring smoother 
traffic flow. Moving forward, plans for 
OPS will include continuous system 
optimisation, expansion to LEKAS, 
as well as activating more OPS toll 
lanes in both BESRAYA and NPE.
Additional information about 
the division’s initiatives and  
non-financial performance can be 
found in the Sustainability Statement 
on pages 128 to 215.
Moving forward, the division 
foresees momentum from the 
ongoing developments of massive 
commercial and residential projects 
along its highway corridors, igniting 
a surge in tollable traffic and driving 
positive revenue streams for the 
division. With the strength of its 
mature urban highways, the division 
is poised to contribute positively to 
the Group’s performance. 
WCE Progress
The Group, via its investments 
in WCE Holdings Bhd and West 
Coast Expressway Sdn Bhd, has a 
41% effective interest in the WCE 
concession connecting Banting to 
Taiping. The WCE Project is divided 
into 11 sections whereby 6 sections 
have been completed and are 
currently operational.

These are Section 5 (New North 
Klang Straits Bypass - Bandar Bukit 
Raja Utara), Section 6 (Bandar Bukit 
Raja Utara – Assam Jawa), Section 
8 (Hutan Melintang - Teluk Intan), 
Section 9 (Kampung Lekir - Changkat 
Cermin), Section 10 (Changkat 
Cermin - Beruas) and Section 11 
(Beruas – Taiping Selatan). The recent 
opening of Section 11 signifies the full 
completion of the Perak alignment, 
spanning 120km within the WCE 
Project. The opening of Section 
11’s Taiping Selatan provides direct 
access between our WCE to North 
South Expressway (NSE) at Changkat 
Jering in Taiping, Perak, providing 
connectivity to the region’s economic 
and infrastructure development.
The construction of Section 1 
(Banting – South Klang Valley 
Expressway (SKVE)) and Section 
2 (SKVE – Shah Alam Expressway 
(KESAS)) have been completed and is 
currently at the inspection stage. The 
completion of these 2 sections will 
also provide connections to several 
existing highways, namely the South 
Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE) 
and the Shah Alam Expressway 
(KESAS), which would enhance the 
accessibility and connectivity of 
these areas along the alignment.
The construction for the final 3 
sections namely, Section 3 (KESAS 
– Federal Highway Route 2), Section 
4 (Federal Highway Route 2 – New 
North South Klang Straits Bypass 
(NNKSB)) and Section 7 (Assam 
Jawa – Tanjung Karang) is currently 
ongoing and is expected to be ready 
in 2026.
In FY2024, the associate contributed 
a higher revenue of RM12.88 million 
(FY2023: RM9.41 million) mainly due 
to improving traffic volumes after the 
opening of additional Sections 6 and 
11. However, our share of losses was 
higher at RM36.26 million (FY2023:  
Loss of RM26.57 million), due to 
an increase in interest costs upon 
additional sectional opening.
Looking ahead, the additional 
sectional toll revenue is anticipated 
to further enhance and contribute to 
the Group’s financial performance.  
In the longer term, once the entire 
WCE alignment is fully operational, 
our associated company foresees 
a shift towards profitability, with 
revenue growth gradually surpassing 
interest costs as traffic matures.
India
In India, the division’s operating 
toll roads are the 99.9%-owned 
Chilakaluripet-Vijayawada Tollway 
(68 km); the wholly-owned Dewas 
Bypass Tollway (19.8 km); and the 
Solapur-Bijapur Tollway (109.1 km). 
Our Indian tollways have concession 
periods ranging from 15 to 25 years.
During FY2024, the Indian tollways 
contributed a higher revenue, which 
increased by 11.0% to RM216.69 
million compared to RM195.16 
million in the previous year. This was 
mainly due to higher traffic volume 
and toll rate revisions during the 
financial period.
The Indian tollways reported a 
reduced loss before tax of RM57.61 
million for FY2024, compared to 
a loss of RM197.48 million the 
previous year. The higher loss in the 
prior year was due to unfavourable 
foreign exchange movements on 
US Dollar denominated borrowings 
and higher maintenance (resurfacing) 
costs in relation to the Chilakaluripet-
Vijayawada Tollway. 
The concession for the Chilakaluripet-
Vijayawada Tollway ended on 21 July 
2024 and the toll road was handed 
back to the NHAI.
Argentina
In Argentina, the Group’s 20%-owned 
Grupo Concesionario del Oeste S.A. 
(“GCO”) operates the concession of 
the 56 km Western Access Tollway in 
Buenos Aires until 31 December 2030. 
The tollway is the most convenient 
route to the city for the Western 
Zone’s three million residents. In 
FY2024, GCO contributed a revenue 
of RM90.68 million and our share of 
profits was RM2.07 million.

The NAGA 2 jack-up drilling rig entering the breakwater of Kuantan Port 2
In FY2024, Kuantan Port achieved 
a significant milestone by handling 
26.18 million freight weight tonnes 
(“FWT”) of cargo, marking a 
substantial increase from 22.67 
million FWT in FY2023 and resulting 
in a remarkable 40.8% rise in revenue.
In FY2024, Kuantan Port recorded 
RM467.01 million in revenue, 
registering an increase of 40.8% 
over RM331.79 million in FY2023. Its 
PBT has significantly increased by  
343.1% to RM151.39 million in 
FY2024 from RM34.16 million 
previously. These results were 
primarily driven by new tariff rates 
and higher cargo throughput, which 
increased by 15.5% from 22.67 
million FWT in FY2023 to 26.18 
million FWT in FY2024. The port also 
registered lease income of RM27.00 
million in FY2024 versus RM18.76 
million in FY2023, with new tenants 
including a car RoRo service, bauxite, 
and palm kernel shell exporters.
Looking ahead, Kuantan Port aims to 
further elevate its capacity, targeting 
up to 35 million FWT annually by 
FY2027. The key to achieving this 
goal is the extensive development 
of our New Deep Water Terminal, a 
cornerstone investment designed to 
accommodate the expanding needs 
of our customers with deeper drafts 
and automation in cargo handling.
A pivotal initiative in our growth 
strategy includes the construction 
of the East Coast Rail Link (“ECRL”) 
spur lines within Kuantan Port starting 
in FY2025, with full operational 
readiness expected by 2027. This 
transformative infrastructure project 
will not only enhance logistical 
efficiency but also open new avenues, 
such as facilitating Roll-on/Roll-off 
(“RoRo”) vehicle shipments to East 
Malaysia, thereby bolstering regional 
connectivity and trade capabilities 
providing positive impact on future 
cargo volumes.
FY2024 witnessed some strides in 
the business recovery journey for 
Kuantan Port. Despite encountering 
challenges like supply chain 
disruptions, geopolitical tensions, 
and the Red Sea crisis towards the 
fiscal year-end, there were notable 
impacts on global market demand 
and supply. Kuantan Port, however, 
maintained a vigilant stance, adapting 
to market fluctuations, and remained 
committed to pursuing sustainable 
growth strategies.
Higher Cargo Volume 
Despite the challenges, bauxite cargo 
owners experienced improvements 
towards the end of FY2024 due to 
effective interactions with the local 
authorities aimed at facilitating export 
activities. Kuantan Port managed to 
load 0.52 million FWT of bauxite in 
FY2024 and anticipates increased 
handling in FY2025, driven by 
smoother approvals from authorities.

and Hong Kong markets. ESSB 
also contributed to this increase as 
they started to export steel billets 
and steel slabs in August 2023, 
contributing approximately 594,000 
FWT as of March 2024.
Container cargo marked an 
improvement of 10.8% against 
FY2023. Kuantan Port handled 
142,000 twenty-foot equivalent units 
(TEUs) of containers in FY2024, 
mainly due to continuous economic 
recovery since the pandemic. 
Growth Opportunities Ahead
The largest investment planned 
in the near future is the further 
development of Kuantan Port’s New 
Deep Water Terminal. This is needed 
to match the expansion plan of our 
largest customer, ASSB, who upon 
completion of their Phase 2 plant 
in FY2027 will require Kuantan Port 
to handle 20 million FWT of cargo 
throughput.
For business growth, China remains 
the main overseas target, and with 
the assistance of our partner, Beibu 
Gulf Port Group in China, Kuantan 
Port and MCKIP are being actively 
promoted through the Chinese 
government’s Ministry of Commerce 
(MOFCOM). Promotions are also 
conducted through China’s various 
commerce associations and trade 
shows.
The Port is exploring potential 
new cargoes, including liquefied 
carbon dioxide and black pellets. 
The liquefied carbon dioxide project 
is expected to commence plant 
construction by FY2028, with cargo 
handling scheduled to start in 
FY2030, estimated at 2.50 million 
tonnes. The black pellet processing 
plant is expected to be completed 
by Q3 FY2025, with a capacity of 
120,000 metric tonnes annually.
Kuantan Port has successfully 
implemented the new port tariffs at 
the outset of FY2024, setting a strong 
foundation for continued growth in 
FY2025. The Port is committed to 
enhancing its deepwater terminal 
facilities to accommodate expansion 
from existing clients and attract new 
partners, bolstering its capability 
to handle increased throughput 
efficiently.
Kuantan Port also secured additional 
volumes of coal, iron ore, and 
steel products by leveraging on 
its expertise, providing timely and 
effective solutions to facilitate clients’ 
import and export expectations, 
approximating an additional 1 million 
FWT of cargoes through Kuantan 
Port. 
Kuantan Port is also expecting 
additional silica sand to be handled 
in FY2025, with a new mining site 
licence approved and a new silica 
sand refinery plant to be set up. 
In FY2024, dry bulk cargo was up by 
2.08 million FWT (or 17%) compared 
to the previous year. This significant 
improvement was due to increased 
business from Alliance Steel Sdn 
Bhd (“ASSB”) and a new customer, 
Eastern Steel Sdn Bhd (“ESSB”) from 
Kemaman. This resulted in an overall 
increase of 30.4% in import cargoes, 
comprising coal and iron ore.
Break bulk was up by 1.37 million 
FWT compared to the previous 
year, primarily in the category of 
steel pipes and steel products. 
The contribution of steel pipes is 
attributed to the customer Wasco, 
who secured new major projects. 
In steel products, ASSB exported 
more steel product cargo via the New 
Deep Water Terminal due to larger 
vessels being chartered to meet the 
increased demand from Thailand 
MV Heng Mao, the deepest vessel ever berthed  
at Kuantan Port, with a 16.4-metre draught

Furthermore, Kuantan Port is making 
significant strides in improving 
shipping services and connectivity, 
particularly through collaboration 
with Qinzhou Port. Together, the Port 
is optimising container services to 
strengthen trade links and enhance 
efficiency between Kuantan and key 
markets along the New International 
Land-Sea Trade Corridor.
The integration of ECRL is expected 
to revolutionise logistics at Kuantan 
Port, offering competitive costs 
and improved delivery times, 
positioning Kuantan Port as a critical 
trade gateway between China and  
Malaysia. The division’s strategic 
investment and partnerships 
underscore its commitment to 
sustainable growth and operational 
excellence, ensuring the port remains 
a preferred choice in the evolving 
maritime landscape.
Additional information about 
the division’s initiatives and  
non-financial performance can be 
found in the Sustainability Statement  
on pages 128 to 215.
Kuantan Port has successfully 
maintained the ISO 9001:2015, ISO 
14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018 
certifications, which are integrated 
management systems for quality, 
environmental management, and 
occupational health and safety. 
Alongside these, the division 
has upheld the ISO 37001:2016  
anti-bribery management system 
certification, reinforcing its 
commitment to ethical practices.
Kuantan Port’s business philosophy 
has always been to maximise the 
shareholder value. As such, the port  
has a calculated approach to 
investments in port equipment and yard 
facilities whilst ensuring sustainable 
cargo throughput. Looking forward 
to the economic growth of Malaysia’s 
east coast region coupled with the 
additional stimulation from ECRL and 
ASSB’s expansion, the Port is mindful 
to balance its port capacity building  
with sustainable demand and uphold 
its service standards to the customers.

Outlook
In 2024, the global economy is 
expected to grow at a rate of 3.2%. 
In contrast, Bank Negara Malaysia 
projects Malaysia’s economic growth 
to average between 4% and 5% in 
2024, an improvement from 3.7% 
in 2023, underpinned by continued 
expansion in domestic demand and 
improvement in external demand. 
The construction industry in Malaysia 
is expected to continue its growth 
momentum by recording an annual 
growth of 4.4% in 2024, supported 
by allocations from the 2024 Budget.
The Group’s Construction Division 
will concentrate on the timely 
execution and completion of its 
robust order book, which stands at 
RM6.0 billion as of 31 March 2024. 
Given this strong pipeline of projects, 
the division anticipates a stronger 
performance in the upcoming 
FY2025 whilst maintaining a high 
standard of quality. The construction 
industry is expected to be driven by 
investments in transport, industrial 
and renewable energy projects, 
coupled with the government’s 
infrastructure spending.
The property market is anticipated 
to remain resilient, supported by 
a positive economic outlook and 
strong consumer sentiment. The 
Property Division, with approximately 
RM2.6 billion in unbilled sales as of 
31 March 2024 and a diverse range  
of new property launches scheduled 
for FY2025, is well-positioned to 
sustain its strong performance and 
growth in the upcoming financial year.
With a robust order book and the 
prospect of new projects being 
initiated by both the private and 
government sectors, the Industry 
Division is poised to sustain a strong 
performance in FY2025.
The Toll Division is expected to 
sustain its performance in FY2025, 
driven by consistent revenue and 
cash flow generated from its mature 
highways. These established routes 
continue to provide a reliable source 
of recurrent income for the Group. 
Meanwhile, the newer highways are 
undergoing the gestation period 
before achieving maturity in the 
coming years, further bolstering the 
division’s long-term financial stability 
and growth prospects.
The outlook for Port operations is 
positive, largely due to anticipated 
increases in bulk cargo volumes, such 
as bauxite and silica sand. The overall 
performance of the Port operations is 
expected to remain strong, benefiting 
from the increased handling capacity 
and improved efficiency.
Based on the strong order books 
in the Construction and Industry 
Divisions, coupled with resilient 
property market conditions and 
robust port operations, are expected 
to drive growth in the year ahead. 
Additionally, the consistent revenue 
from mature toll highways further 
supports this positive outlook. 
With these favourable conditions 
across various sectors, the Group 
is well-positioned for an improved 
performance in FY2025.
Closing
As we embark on the next phase of 
growth, I look forward to collaborating 
closely with all colleagues and 
business partners to propel IJM and 
our four business units to greater 
achievements. Together, we will 
harness our collective strengths, 
foster innovation, and capitalise on 
emerging opportunities to elevate our 
performance and realise our strategic 
objectives. 
With optimism and commitment, I am 
confident that our collective efforts 
will strengthen our market presence 
and deliver sustainable value for 
our stakeholders. Let us approach 
this journey with enthusiasm and 
determination, laying the groundwork 
for a successful future for the IJM 
Group. We will continue to be vigilant 
and proactive in management 
while operating in a significantly 
challenging business environment. 
In conclusion, I would like to thank the 
Board, management and employees 
of the Group for their commitment, 
dedication and contribution. I would 
also like to express my deepest 
appreciation to our shareholders, 
clients, bankers, contractors, 
suppliers and stakeholders for their 
continued support of the Group.

ensure that there is a balance of power and authority.  
The responsibilities of the Non-Executive Chairman 
and the CEO&MD are set out in the Board Charter.

electronically and generally five (5) business days in 
advance to ensure Directors are well informed and 
have the opportunity to seek additional information, 
and are able to obtain further clarification from the 
Company Secretary/Management, should such a 
need arise. The Company Secretary always ensures 
the recording of proper minutes of all deliberations 
and decisions of the Board and Board Committees, 
including any dissenting views and abstentions by 
any director from voting or deliberating on a particular 
matter. For cybersecurity purposes, all meeting 
materials are kept in a secure and collaborative 
board portal and the Directors are granted access  
to meeting materials via respective user identities

 The Directors also attended tender adjudication 
meetings and investment briefings, where they 
deliberate on the Group’s participation in major 
project bids in excess of 5% of the net assets value  
of the Group (or RM250 million for overseas  
contracts). Informal meetings and consultations are 
frequently and freely held to share expertise and 
experiences. During the FY2024, eight (8) board 
briefings were held and attended by the majority of 
the Directors.  
 In fostering the commitment of the Board that the 
Directors devote sufficient time to carry out their 
responsibilities, the Directors are required to notify 
the Chairman before accepting any new directorships 
and such notifications shall include an indication of 
time that will be spent on the new appointments.  
In addition, assurances are given by the Directors 
that their new appointments will not affect their 
commitments and responsibilities as Directors of the 
Company. In the event that the Chairman has any new 
directorship or significant commitments outside the 
Company, he will also notify the Board. All Directors 
of the Company do not hold more than five (5) 
directorships each in public listed companies.
 During the annual Board evaluation, each Director 
was assessed whether he/she was able to devote 
adequate time and attention for Board meetings, 
Board briefings, Board Committee meetings and 
activities of the Company. Overall, the Board was 
satisfied with the commitment of all members of  
the Board and the time contributed by each of 
them. The time commitment of the Directors was 
demonstrated by their attendance and participation  
in Board and Board Committee meetings and  
briefings during FY2024.
5. Code of Conduct and Ethics
 The Board is committed to conducting its business 
in a legal and professional manner, with the highest 
standard of integrity and ethical values, and has 
adopted the Code of Conduct and Ethics for 
Employees (“CCEE”) which applies to all Directors 
and employees. The CCEE covers the areas of 
workplace culture and environment, company 
records and assets, conflict of interest, anti-bribery 
and corruption, gifts, hospitality and entertainment, 
insider trading, money laundering, fraud and so forth.  
 The Board also places emphasis on the business 
ethics and conduct of third parties who have  
dealings or transactions with the Group and has 
adopted the Code of Business Conduct for Third 
Parties (“CBC for 3 rd Parties”) which applies to all 
persons or entities who provide work, goods and 
services or act for or on behalf of the Group. The areas 
covered by the CBC for 3 rd Parties include but are not 
limited to the Company’s assets and information, 
dealing with customers and media, conflict of interest, 
health, safety and environment (HSE), anti-bribery 
and corruption, gifts, hospitality and entertainment.
 As part of the Company’s commitment against all 
forms of bribery and corruption, the Board has in 
place the ABCS which consolidates various policies 
and processes in compliance with anti-bribery and 
corruption laws. The anti-bribery and corruption 
policy (“ABC Policy”) of the Company forms part of the 
ABCS and aims to set out the parameters including 
the main principles, policies and guidelines in relation 
to anti-bribery and corruption. The initiatives of  
the Company to comply with ABCS during the 
financial year are set out in the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control.  
 The CCEE, CBC for 3 rd Parties and ABC Policy are 
available for reference at www.ijm.com.
6. Whistleblowing Policy
 The Board encourages employees and associates 
to report incidences of suspected and/or real 
misconduct, wrongdoings, corruption and instances 
of fraud, waste, and/or abuse involving the resources 
of the Group. The Whistleblowing Policy adopted  
by the Company provides and facilitates a structured 
mechanism for any employee and associate to 
make disclosures of alleged improper conduct 
(whistleblowing) to the relevant authorities in good 
faith. The Whistleblowing Policy is posted on the 
Company’s website at www.ijm.com for ease of 
access for reporting by employees, associates and 
third parties of the Group. 
7. Sustainability
 The Board together with Management take 
responsibility for the governance of sustainability 
in the Company and had adopted a sustainability 
governance framework that defines and guides the 
Group towards impact-focused targets. The Group 
undertook a comprehensive climate assessment, 
which lasted for 1.5 years, before publicly  
announcing its climate commitment in April 2023.  
As part of the development of the Group’s climate 
strategy, the Board had numerous engagements  
with Management and appointed consultants. The 
climate assessment included the Group’s carbon 
emissions profile of Scope 1, 2 and 3 (8 categories), 
as well as its climate physical and transition risks  
and opportunities.

CoRpoRate goveRnanCe oveR vieW stateMent  
 The Board continued to play an essential role in 
aligning environmental, social and governance 
(“ESG”) initiatives with the strategic direction of the 
Group. The Directors also participated in training  
and/or seminars to stay abreast with and understand 
the sustainability issues relevant to the Company 
and the business. In the annual Board Assessment 
for FY2024, the Board observed that enhancing  
ESG knowledge and focus at the Board level is 
imperative for guiding Management in pursuing  
ESG strategically. Consequently, the Board 
would continue to place great emphasis on their  
sustainability leadership and roles related to ESG 
and sustainability. The details of the sustainability 
initiatives of the Group are set out in the  
Sustainability Statement on pages 128 to 215. 
II. Board Composition
 There are 11 Board members, ten (10) of whom 
are Non-Executive Directors, and among the  
Non-Executive Directors, seven (7) are Independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Board comprises a 
majority of Independent Directors. The Chairman is  
a Non-Executive Director.
 The balance between Independent Non-Executive, 
Non-Executive and Executive Directors, together  
with the support from Management, is to ensure 
that there is an effective and fair representation 
for shareholders, including minority shareholders. 
It further ensures that issues of strategy, performance 
and resources are fully addressed and investigated 
to take into account the long-term interests of 
shareholders, other relevant stakeholders and the 
community in which the Group conducts its business.  
 Apart from the appropriate mix of skills, knowledge 
and experience, a person to be appointed or  
elected/re-elected as Director shall possess the 
necessary quality and character as well as integrity, 
competency and commitment. The persons who 
were appointed or re-elected as Directors during 
the financial year had respectively submitted a  
self-declaration as to his/her fitness and propriety 
via the Directors’ Declaration of Fit and Proper Form 
adopted by the Board. 
 During the FY2024, the NRC reviewed the  
composition of the Board using a Board matrix to 
assess whether it is balanced and diversified, capable 
of bringing fresh perspectives to the Company.  
Based on the results of the FY2024 Board Evaluation 
provided by the independent consultant, it was 
observed that the Board’s composition could be 
enhanced to achieve greater diversity in terms of 
skills, backgrounds, experiences, age, gender and 
ethnicity, while maintaining the current Board size.
 The composition and size of the Board is reviewed 
annually to ensure its appropriateness and 
effectiveness. The profile of each Director is presented 
on pages 28 to 33.
1.  Independence
 The Independent Non-Executive Directors play a 
crucial role of bringing objectivity to the decisions 
made by the Board. They provide independent 
judgment, experience and objectivity without being 
subordinated to operational considerations. They 
help to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders 
are taken into account and that the relevant  
issues are subjected to objective and impartial 
consideration by the Board. 
 To date, none of the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company has exceeded the term  
limit of nine (9) years as an Independent Director.
2. Board Diversity
 The Directors have a diverse set of skills, experience 
and knowledge necessary to govern the Group. 
The Directors are professionals in the fields of 
construction and engineering, finance, accounting, 
investments, property, toll infrastructure, legal  
practice and climate governance. Together, they  
bring a wide range of competencies, capabilities, 
technical skills and relevant business experience to 
ensure that the Group continues to be a competitive 
leader within its diverse industry segments with 
a strong reputation for technical and professional 
competence.

4. Board and Board Committee Evaluation
 The Board undertook a formal and comprehensive 
annual evaluation of its own performance, comprising 
the Board as a whole, the Board Committees, each 
individual Director as well as the independence  
of Independent Directors for FY2024 (“BA 2024”) 
via an independent consultant. The BA 2024 was 
conducted online and the results of the BA 2024 
were presented by the independent consultant to  
the NRC for deliberation and review, before the  
NRC reported to the Board.  
 Based on the results of the BA 2024, the NRC and 
the Board were satisfied with the overall performance 
and effectiveness of the Board. The overall rating 
by the Board was positive, with consensus among 
all Board members highlighting several strengths, 
including the diverse knowledge and experience 
of the Board members, sufficient support from the  
Board Committees, effective Board leadership, 
and active participation of Board members at 
meetings. The areas identified for enhancement 
are cybersecurity, ESG and risk management. The 
independent consultant had highlighted some 
areas for improvement, including diversity in gender 
and ethnicity. The Board and the NRC will take the 
necessary actions to address these areas.  
 The Board Committee evaluation comprises the 
Audit Committee assessment, NRC assessment 
and Operating Committee assessment to review 
their performance and determine whether the 
Board Committees had carried out their duties in 
accordance with their Terms of Reference. The Board 
was satisfied with the performance and effectiveness 
of all the Board Committees and there were no major 
concerns from the results of the evaluation of the 
Board Committees.
 In view of the appropriate level of knowledge, skills, 
experience and commitment of the Audit Committee 
members being critical to the Audit Committee’s 
ability to discharge its responsibilities effectively,  
an assessment of the Audit Committee members  
(self & peers) was also carried out for FY2024.
 The NRC also reviewed and assessed the  
performance of the Directors who are seeking for 
re-election through the Self & Peer Assessments 
for FY2024. The areas of assessment include board 
dynamics, contribution and commitment, roles and 
responsibilities, technical competence, governance, 
independence and integrity. Based on the  
assessment, the NRC was satisfied with their 
performances and was of the view that their 
continued service would benefit the Company and its 
stakeholders.
5.		 Directors’	Training	
 During the financial year, all Directors had attended 
various relevant in-house and external training 
programmes, workshops, seminars, briefings and/

by the Directors were related to sustainability, 
ESG, climate risk, economics, finance, innovation 
and technology, cybersecurity, governance, anti-
bribery and corruption, risk management and 
industry knowledge.  The Board has undertaken an  
assessment of the training needs of each Director 
through the Self & Peer Assessment for the FY2024.
 The details of the training programmes of each of the 
Directors of the Company are available for reference

to obtain a better perspective of the business 
and enhance their understanding of the Group’s 
operations.
 In addition, an induction programme was conducted

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION 
The IAD is headed by the CAE, Yusri Yunus who holds 
a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting and Finance)  
degree from the Australian National University, Australia 
and a member of the Institute of Internal Auditors,  
Malaysia. He has previous experiences in leading internal 
audit teams in multinational corporation, government-
linked corporation and large diversified public listed 
companies. The CAE reports directly to the Audit 
Committee and administratively to the Group CEO & MD.  
The Audit Committee is satisfied that the internal 
auditors’ independence has been maintained as  
adequate safeguards are in place. All internal auditors 
have signed the annual declarations that they were and 
had been independent, objective and in compliance  
with the Code of Conduct and Ethics for Employees of  
IJM Corporation Berhad (“IJM”), and the Institute of 
Internal Auditors (“IIA”) in carrying out their duties for 
the financial year.  The Audit Committee is satisfied that 
the IAD has sufficient resources and is able to access 
information to undertake its duties effectively. 
The IAD provides to the Board (primarily via the Audit 
Committee) and to Management reasonable assurance  
on the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of  
governance, risk and internal control and the adequacy  
of these systems to manage business risks and to 
safeguard the Group’s assets and resources.

The Internal Audit Charter sets out the purpose,  
functions, scope and responsibilities of the IAD and how 
it maintains independence from the first and second lines 
of defence by Management. The four (4) main functions  
of IAD are to:
•	 Assess	and	report	on	the	effectiveness	of	the	design	
and operation of the framework of governance, risk  
and controls which enable business issues to be 
assessed and managed;
•	 Assess	and	report	on	the	effectiveness	of	management	
actions to address deficiencies in the framework of 
governance, risk and controls;
•	 Investigate	and	report	on	cases	of	suspected	employee	
fraud and malpractice, if any; and
•	 Undertake	 designated	 consulting	 services	 for	
Management provided that they do not threaten  
IAD’s independence from Management and the 
provision of Level Three assurance.
During the year, the Internal Audit Plan for FY2024 
was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee 
in February 2023. The Internal Audit Plan for FY2024 
prioritised the Group’s FY2024 Operational Plan  
following a risk-based assessment of its entire business 
landscape and a review against the Group’s risk policies. 
The reviews carried out covered an extensive sample of 
controls over high and significant risk types (including 
related party transactions and conflict of interest), 
business units and entities. Selective lower risk units  
were also included on a periodic rotation basis.    
The IAD adopts a risk-based auditing approach, guided 
by the International Professional Practices Framework 
(IPPF) issued by the IIA. They evaluated the adequacy 
and effectiveness of key controls in responding to risks 
within the organisation’s governance, operations and 
information systems, in terms of:
•	 Reliability	and	 integrity	 of	 financial	 and	 operational	
information;
•	 Effectiveness	and	efficiency	of	operations;
•	 Safeguarding	of	assets;	
•	 Exposure	to	committed	and	contingent	liabilities;	and
•	 Compliance	with	 relevant	 laws,	 regulations	 and	
contractual obligations.
All audit findings, for which root-cause analyses were 
conducted, are reported to the appropriate levels of 
Management when identified. Based on the scope of 
audits performed, IAD will state their overall opinion on 
the state of the audited unit’s governance, risk and control 
processes. The Audit Committee received quarterly 
reports from the IAD on audit reviews carried out and 
Management’s responses to the findings and progress  
in addressing identified issues. Members of Management 
were made responsible for ensuring that timely corrective 
actions on the reported deficiencies were taken within  
the required timeframes. IAD conducted follow-up 
audits on key engagements to ensure that the corrective  
actions were implemented appropriately and timely. 
In this respect, IAD has added value to enhancing the 
governance, risk management and control processes 
within the Group.
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the IAD’s 
financial budget and staffing requirements to ensure that 
the function is adequately resourced. 
The total cost incurred in managing the IAD for the  
financial year under review was RM3.2 million  
(FY2023: RM2.4 million). A summary of the internal  
audit cost distribution is as follows:
Cost Category %	 
of total cost
Manpower 89%
Training 1%*
Travelling (inclusive of accommodation) 4%
Overheads 6%
* Excludes HRDC reimbursements.

BOARD’S	RESPONSIBILITY	
The Board of Directors (“Board”) affirms its commitment 
and responsibility for maintaining a sound risk management 
framework and internal control system to safeguard the 
shareholders’ investments and the Group’s assets, as well 
as to discharge its stewardship responsibility in identifying 
principal risks and ensuring the implementation of an 
appropriate risk management and internal control system 
to manage those risks in accordance with Principle B of 
the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board continually articulates, implements and reviews 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s enterprise-
wide risk management and internal control system which 
has been embedded in all aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The Board reviews the processes, responsibilities and 
assesses for reasonable assurance that risks have been 
managed within the Group’s risk appetite and tolerance, 
with a system that is viable and robust. 
Recognising the ever-changing risk landscape, the 
Group’s system is designed to effectively manage rather 
than completely eliminate the risks of failure to achieve the 
Group’s business objectives. Accordingly, such systems 
can only provide a reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement, loss or fraud. The aim, 
however, is to ensure that any adverse impact arising 
from a foreseeable future event or situation on the Group’s 
objectives is identified, mitigated and managed.
Risk	Management	&	Sustainability	Committee	(“RMSC”)
The RMSC was established by the Board on 30 November 
2023, and held its inaugural meeting on 21 February  
2024.  This initiative aims to better align the RMSC’s 
evolving role in supporting the Board’s oversight of the 
Group’s risk management, sustainability, and anti-bribery 
and corruption frameworks and policies, which were 
previously under the purview of the Audit Committee 
(“AC”).  
The RMSC is tasked with establishing the overarching 
direction of the Group’s risk strategy and ensuring the 
seamless integration of risk appetite and compliance 
across the business, operations, and organisational 
culture.  Supported by the Risk Management Committee 
(“RMC”) and Risk Management & Integrity Department 
(“RMI”), it collaborates with the Board to oversee risk 
management, and compliance strategies, policies, 
processes, frameworks, and other risk-related matters.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (“FY2024”), 
RMC reviewed, appraised and assessed the controls 
and actions in place to mitigate and manage the overall 
Group’s risk exposure, as well as raised issues of concerns 
and recommended mitigating actions.  The RMC reported 
to the AC during the first three quarters of FY2024, and 
transitioned to reporting to the RMSC during the final 
quarter, as part of its monitoring activity ensuring key 
risks are deliberated and appropriate mitigating actions 
are implemented. The AC and subsequently the RMSC 
presented quarterly summaries of their deliberations and 
decisions to the Board.
Audit	Committee	(“AC”)
The AC’s main role is to support the Board in assessing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system, 
overseeing both financial and non-financial reporting, and 
ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.  
The AC evaluates internal controls through internal audits 
conducted by the Internal Audit Department (“IAD”) and 
recommendations provided by the external auditor.
During the financial year, the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the system of internal controls was reviewed by the AC 
in relation to the internal audits conducted by the IAD, as 
well as control issues reported by the external auditor.  The 
AC deliberated on the audit issues and the actions taken 
by Management, and a summary of these deliberations 
has been presented to the Board. The AC will address 
and monitor any internal control weaknesses and ensure 
continuous process improvement.
In line with Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements 
(“LR”) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) and 
guided by the Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control: 
Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, the Board is committed to 
preserve and uphold a sound system of risk management and internal 
control as well as good corporate governance practices throughout  
IJM Corporation Berhad (“IJM” or “the Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(“the Group”).

4. Risk Assessment Review
In the face of subdued national economic growth, limited local infrastructure projects, persistently high interest 
rates, and geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine War and Middle East conflicts, the Group is leveraging 
its strengths and opportunities by focusing on cost optimisation, revenue generation, and innovative business 
processes to enhance competitiveness and safeguard its financial position and agility.  The Group remained resilient 
through systematic and adequate control measures in place to ensure risks and their exposures are continuously 
reviewed and proactively mitigated.
The Group conducted a series of risk reviews during the financial year and has subsequently reported the  
assessment outcome to the Board via the AC in the first three quarters of the financial year and to the newly 
established RMSC during the last quarter.  Significant risk areas affecting the Group were identified together with 
strategic mitigating actions established to manage the risk exposure, as presented below:

Strategic Risk Management 
Description Strategic Mitigation Efforts
Commodity Risk
The Construction, Property and Industry divisions are 
directly exposed to material price volatility resulting in 
the erosion of the Group’s profit margins and together 
with supply delays cause postponement of certain 
projects.  
The escalation of geopolitical tensions, notably in the 
Middle East and the Russian-Ukraine war, ongoing 
friction between the US and China, the swift reopening 
of economies, and disruptions in supply chains, are 
contributing significantly to price volatility, especially in 
imported materials.
Moreover, the government’s decision to remove fuel 
subsidies and implement an increase in the Sales & 
Service Tax is anticipated to exacerbate the rise in 
material prices further.
•			Execute	bulk	purchase	strategy	for	high	consuming	
construction materials.
•			Inclusion	 of	 Variation	 of	 Pricing	 (VOP)	 clauses	 in	
conditions of contracts to accommodate the material 
price volatility. 
•			Participation	 in	 industry-wide	 working	 groups	 
(i.e. Real Estate and Housing Developers’  
Association (REHDA) & Master Builders Association 
Malaysia (MBAM) for engagement dialogues with 
government and regulators to highlight the industry 
concerns. 
•			Focus	 on	 cost	 optimisation	 and	 business	 process	
innovation and digitisation to remain resilient and 
agile.
Political/ Regulatory Risk
The Group’s businesses are heavily regulated by  
relevant laws, regulations and concession agreement 
terms.  Any adverse change to regulatory policies will 
have negative ramifications towards the business.
•			Constantly	 assess	 the	 impact	 of	 new	 or	 changes	
to laws and regulations affecting the Group’s  
businesses to ensure that existing processes 
and infrastructure settings are able to satisfy new 
regulatory requirements.
•			Active	involvement	in	industry/	trade	associations	to	
have constant dialogues with regulatory authorities.
Financial Risk Management
Description Strategic Mitigation Efforts
Foreign	Exchange	Risk
The Group’s diverse business industries in multiple 
jurisdictions resulted in an exposure to foreign currency 
fluctuations, mainly in United States Dollar, Indian 
Rupee, Chinese Yuan and Pound Sterling.
•			Execute	forward	foreign	exchange	contracts	or	cross	
currency swap contracts (where applicable).
•			Periodic	 review	 and	 maintain	 foreign	 currency	
denominated borrowings within the tolerable 
thresholds.

Financial Risk Management
Description Strategic Mitigation Efforts
Counterparty Risk 
Risk of loss arising from customers’ or vendors’ failure 
to fulfil their financial and contractual obligations in 
accordance with the agreed contractual terms.
•			Conduct	 regular	 creditworthiness	 assessment	 on	
existing and potential customers. 
•			Perform	 vendor	 assessment	 prior	 to	 determining	
the list of prospective vendors; and conduct annual 
assessment on existing vendors.
•			Ensure	 compliance	 to	 Group’s	 debt	 repayment	
policies.
•			Persistent	follow-up	and	close	monitoring	of	overdue	
debts.
Liquidity Risk 
Property, Infrastructure and Construction divisions 
require high capital allocations.  Maintaining a healthy 
cash-flow position is crucial for business sustainability.
•			Conduct	 cash	 flow	 position	 assessment	 through	
periodic review meetings to ensure a healthy balance 
is maintained.

Climate Change Risk
The Group is aware that climate change including 
adverse weather patterns and rising sea levels may 
present significant risks to the global community. 
Being a responsible corporate organisation, the 
Group endeavours to align its business strategies 
and sustainability initiatives to be in-line with globally 
accepted sustainability standards [e.g., TCFD & United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG)].
•			The	 Group	 continuously	 embarks	 on	 innovation

Business Continuity
Description Strategic Mitigation Efforts
Cybersecurity Risk
Businesses and individuals today are more dependent 
than ever on digital connectivity in virtually every aspect 
of their existence.  Any disruption in digital connectivity 
is considered an obstacle in the path of progress.  
As part of the Group’s innovation journey to embrace 
digitalisation and automation, it increases its digital 
footprint and this inevitably resulted in an increased 
cyber threat towards the Group’s IT infrastructure.
During the financial year 2024, the following initiatives 
were carried out to address IT security risks and to 
enhance controls effectiveness:
•			Conducted	 a	 full	 IT	 General	 Controls	 (“ITGC”)	
assessment for the core backbone systems by an 
external auditor, with no major findings reported;
•			Performed	internal	ITGC	review	across	other	divisions,	
no major findings were detected;
•			Implemented	a	Security	Operations	Center	(“SOC”)	
which is outsourced and managed by a reputable 
vendor;
•			Activated	Data	Leak	Protection	(“DLP”)	for	emails	as	
an additional layer of protection;
•			Aligned	Group	IT	policies	and	procedures	with	the	 
ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and ISO/IEC 20000:2011 
guidelines; and
•			Installed	biometrics	access	controls	at	key	locations	
housing critical infrastructure.
Disaster Recovery Management 
Having a resilient IT eco-system is crucial for the 
Group’s business continuity of key operations in the 
event of Information and Communications Technology 
(ICT) and natural disasters such as major equipment 
failures, cyber-attacks, virus outbreaks, fires, floods and 
earthquakes. The Group has embarked on a stringent 
approach towards making sure that its IT infrastructure 
is able to support business requirements uptime.  
After successfully meeting the targeted Recovery Point 
Objective (“RPO”) for the Group’s core backbone ERP 
system in the fiscal year 2024, the Group is now focused 
on enhancing its Recovery Time Objective (“RTO”) 
capabilities.
Furthermore, the Group is currently developing RPO/
RTO targets and processes for other critical front-end 
business operating systems.
REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY ExTERNAL AUDITORS
As required by Paragraph 15.23 of the LR of Bursa Securities, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control. Their limited assurance review was performed in accordance with the Audit and 
Assurance Practice Guide (“AAPG”) 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. AAPG 3 does not require the 
external auditors to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control 
systems of the Group.
CONCLUSION

In our recent sustainability materiality assessment, the 23 material topics identified in FY2023 remain relevant for both the 
IJM Group and stakeholders. 
The top right quadrant highlights the sustainability topics that are most material to our stakeholders and the IJM Group. 
The outcome of the assessment resulted in Climate Adaptation and Climate Mitigation moving to the top right quadrant 
as the topics has become more prominent on the Group’s agenda. 
In the next financial year, the Group will conduct a thorough refresh of its materiality assessment process to gain deeper 
insights on the interests and concerns of key stakeholders. This initiative aims to prioritise sustainability issues and align 
strategies accordingly, enhancing stakeholder engagement and addressing their needs effectively.

services.
The division is diversifying its 
portfolio into investment properties 
such as malls, hotels, offices as well 
as wellness centres that cater to the 
evolving needs of urban lifestyles. 
In tandem with the focus on driving 
commercial developments, the 
division will launch the first phase 
of its commercial parcel located at 
the heart of a 58-acre integrated 
development of Pantai Sentral Park, 
Kuala	 Lumpur,	surrounding	 a	 200-
acre forest reserve.
Sierra Hijauan, Ampang, blends urban sophistication with the tranquillity of nature, creating a harmonious environment for residents
The Light City Penang is a 4.1 million 
sq ft large scale mixed-use landmark 
development which is a part of 
the 152-acre The Light Waterfront 
Penang masterplan. The Light City 
is developed into two phases with 
phase one consisting of the Penang 
Waterfront Convention Centre 
(“PWCC”), The Waterfront Shoppes 
with	 gross	 floor	 area	 (“GFA”)	of	 1	
million sqft, residential project named 
Mezzo, as well as hotels and offices. 
Phase two will include an additional 
GFA of 500,000 sqft to The Waterfront 
Shoppes, Lightwater Residences 
and other future developments.
The PWCC which is on track for 
completion in the second quarter 
of 2025, underscores the division’s 
commitment to enhancing local 
infrastructure, addressing the 
region’s growing need for large-
scale event venues, and contributing 
significantly to Penang’s urban 
landscape development. Our goal is 
to continue enriching communities 
with thoughtfully designed projects 
that contribute positively to the 
urban landscape.
The Industry Division’s services also 
include the BubbleDeck solution, 
which not only accelerates project 
timelines but also supports our 
transition to sustainable construction 
practices. This innovative approach 
has enabled us to secure numerous 
contracts for our SMART IBS solution 
across a variety of building projects 
that includes educational institutions, 
semiconductor facilities, and data 
centres. Projects such as the Infineon 
multi-story car park, the Immigration, 
Custom	 and	 Quarantine	 Complex	
between Johor Bahru and Singapore, 
and	 Hospital	 Kapar,	 highlight	 the	
transformative impact of our SMART 
IBS solution in enhancing efficiency 
and sustainability across different 
sectors.

concrete	consumption	by	up	to	30%,	
compared to conventional concrete 
casting. Furthermore, BubbleDeck, 
which is a beamless slab system, 
enables	longer	spans	by	up	to	50%	
further than traditional structures, 
improving aesthetics and simplifying 
mechanical and electrical works.
The Port Division elevates customer 
satisfaction through innovation and 
operational excellence, ensuring a 
smooth, efficient, and rewarding client 
experience. In FY2024, the division 
focused on enhancing interactions 
with local authorities to foster strategic 
partnerships and facilitate seamless 
export and import activities. 
The division also upgraded port 
facilities that enhance operational 
efficiency, enabling quicker 
turnaround times and better service 
to customers. Dedicated key account 
managers regularly engage with key 
management personnel to address 
any operational issues or concerns. 
In addition, the construction of the 
East	Coast	Rail	Link	(ECRL)	spur	lines	
is poised to enhance cargo capacity, 
reinforcing the division’s role as the 
import and export hub in global trade. 
The expansion is set to be operational 
by 2027.
The Toll Division prioritises customer 
safety and satisfaction through 
enhancements to infrastructure, 
focusing on pavement structural 
overlays, slope rehabilitation, and 
bridge strengthening. In high-risk 
areas, we have added anti-skid 
rumble strips to alert motorists against 
speeding on curves and upgraded to 
Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) for better 
skid resistance and faster water run-
off. These measures have successfully 
reduced	 accidents	 by	 up	 to	 37%	
in prone areas. Additionally, our 
high-performance polymer pothole 
patching method ensures excellent 
workability and immediate traffic 
access post-installation.
Despite improvements in public 
transportation and road networks, 
traffic	congestion	in	 Kuala	 Lumpur	
remains a challenge, especially

ENVIRONMENT:  
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
In April 2023, IJM introduced its Climate Strategy, known as R2O, containing 
mitigation and adaptation strategies that are anchored on two underlying 
findings. Firstly, major IPCC pathways point to a 1.5°C scenario in the early 
2030s, thus compelling the need to strengthen climate resilience. Secondly, 
as the Group’s Scope 3 emissions account for 90% of our baseline FY2023, 
reduction measures must include our supply chain transitioning with us.
We have made encouraging progress in FY2024 on both fronts. Mitigation 
efforts saw the Industry Division successfully replacing 13% of cement 
content with non-cementitious material while development of the Group’s 
sustainability dashboard is progressing well. It will enable comprehensive 
sustainability performance management across the Organisation. The Group 
has also bolstered our climate adaptation capacity by formalising climate risk 
assessment into the enterprise risk management framework.
We continue to uphold our 
commitment to responsible 
practices when interacting with 
nature through our Policy Statement 
on Environment, elevated by the 
Group’s climate commitment to build 
resilience against climate change. 
The Environmental Management 
System (“EMS”) ensures that we 
conduct our business responsibly, 
use natural resources efficiently 
and implement innovative ways to 
reduce our environmental impacts. 
All divisions operating in Malaysia 
have obtained ISO 14001:2015 
Environmental Management 
Systems certification. 
CLIMATE ACTION 
COMMITMENT
We recognise the increased 
importance of ensuring business 
resilience against the impacts 
of climate change. The Group is 
compelled to address both climate 
mitigation and adaptation to build 
resilience across our whole value 
chain through our Climate Strategy, 
R2O, which was substantiated 
from the outcome of the climate 
assessments conducted from 
FY2022 to FY2023. Our goal is 
to reduce carbon emissions and 
introduce strategic interventions to 
build greater resilience in the face 
of climate change challenges, from 
extreme weather to diminishing 
resources and evolving regulations. 
We continue to adopt the 
recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (“TCFD”) to help us 
identify, assess and incorporate 
climate risks and opportunities 
in our business strategy and 
operations. By aligning with TCFD 
recommendations, we not only 
enhance our ability to navigate 
the challenges posed by climate 
change but also position ourselves 
to embrace emerging opportunities 
in the transition to a low-carbon 
economy. Moreover, this alignment 
will ensure we are well-prepared for 
the forthcoming IFRS S1 and S2 
disclosure requirements, facilitating 
a smoother transition and ensuring 
progressive compliance.

CLIMATE GOVERNANCE 
In FY2024, the Risk Management and 
Sustainability Committee (“RMSC”) 
was formalised to provide oversight 
on matters relating to climate change 
across IJM. Previously, climate-
related matters were deliberated by 
the Board, where it has endorsed 
the Group’s long-term climate 
commitment involving mitigation 
and adaptation measures in line with 
the Group Sustainability Roadmap 
FY2023 – FY2025. The RMSC 
convened in February 2024 to review 
the progress of initiatives under the 
Group’s Climate Strategy, R2O. 
Led by the Group CEO and 
Managing Director, the Operating 
Committee (“OpCo”) oversees the 
assessment and management of 
climate risks and opportunities, 
and their incorporation within the 
business strategy and operations. 
The OpCo is supported by the 
Group Sustainability and Group 
Risk Management departments 
in providing strategic response 
and overall direction in managing 
climate risks and opportunities. 
Across all businesses, divisional 
management committees review 
and manage the execution 
of division-level initiatives  
and monitor the progress of the 
respective goals in line with R2O. 
The broad theme of climate 
change is managed as 
operational risk under the Group 
Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) Framework. In 2024, 
the RMSC has endorsed 
the integration of climate 
consideration within the ERM 
Framework, with specific 
likelihood and impact criteria, 
given the longer time horizon 
they are assessed against. This 
will enable us to manage climate 
risks and seize opportunities 
proactively. 
CLIMATE STRATEGY
Last year, we announced 
our Climate Strategy, R2O, 
which applies a two-pronged 
approach in climate action, 
namely transition to net-zero 
and adaptation to build climate 
resilience. The strategy outlines 
our own low-carbon transition 
pathway and key approaches 
to guide our supply chain to 
transition with us.

ENVIRONMENT: OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
As climate change accelerates and 
intensifies the physical risks caused by 
extreme weather, the need to act becomes 
more urgent, impacting the scale and 
pace of transition risks. Recognising 
these interdependencies, the Group 
conducted in-depth climate assessments 
that spanned one and a half years since 
FY2022. Our carbon footprint assessment 
referenced recommendations by the 
Science Based Target Initiative (“SBTi”) 
whereas climate risks assessment 
employed the scenarios published by 
the IPCC, International Energy Agency 
(“IEA”) and the Network for Greening the 
Financial Systems (“NGFS”).

We recognise the imperatives to align 
our actions with climate science and 
avoid following a pathway that may 
not be consistent with addressing 
the climate crisis. Hence, our targets 
were established in line with the 
criteria and recommendations of 
the Science Based Targets Initiative 
(“SBTi”). While we have made great 
efforts to closely align our targets 
with SBTi’s cross-sector pathway, 
we have deviated from the minimum 
ambitions set by SBTi.
We will continue to assess our position to fully align with SBTi in the future, taking consideration of current cross-sector 
pathways as well as any sectoral decarbonisation approach relevant to our business. This will also entail introducing 
suitable and credible near-term interim targets and improving our understanding of construction project carbon s-curve 
profiles.

In the longer term, we aim to 
reduce operational emissions 
by decarbonising our fleet and 
machinery, optimising energy usage, 
reducing waste and adopting green 
transport solutions. Given the bulk of 
our emissions emanate from Scope 
3 Category 1 (Purchased Goods and 
Services), and the heavy reliance 
on supply chain decarbonisation, 
reducing our Scope 3 Embodied

METRICS AND T ARGETS – 
GHG EMISSIONS 
[GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-3, GRI 305-5]
One of the critical steps in 
establishing an impactful carbon 
reduction strategy is to develop a 
robust baseline data. In FY2023, we 
established our carbon emissions 
baseline following the completion 
of a carbon footprint assessment 
that comprised the screening and 
profiling of the Group’s emissions, 
accounting for Scope 1, Scope 2 
and eight categories of Scope 3 
emissions, covering 126 operational 
sites and entities. In FY2024, we 
expanded our coverage to 130 
operational sites in Malaysia and 
India. 
We continually enhance our data 
collection process and reporting 
across the Group. This year, we 
obtained and segregated emissions 
from construction activities 
undertaken by our sub-contractors, 
which is reported under the Group’s 
Scope 3 Embodied emissions 
(Category 1: Purchased Goods 
and Services). In FY2023, these 
emissions were reported under 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Scope 1:
Emissions under Scope 1 account for 2.2% of our total carbon footprint.  
Scope 1 emissions include all emissions released directly by our operations 
from company-owned vehicles and equipment: 
•	Mobile combustion: Fuel purchased for company-owned vehicles and 
mobile equipment at project sites, factories and offices.
•	Stationary combustion: Natural gas-fired boilers at factories (Industry 
Division only) and diesel-fired stationary equipment at project sites, factories 
and offices.
Scope 2:
Emissions under this scope account for 5.5% of IJM’s total emissions. Scope 
2 emissions are associated with electricity purchased (location-based) and 
consumed by offices, factories, other buildings, street lightings and equipment 
used in our operations.

Methodology, boundary and assumptions:
1. Our calculation methodology is based on the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard using the operational control 
consolidation approach.
2. Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions factors are 
sourced from the GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting version 2.0 (2022), published 
by	the	UK	Department	for	Environment,	Food	&	
Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) and Embodied Carbon: The 
Inventory of Carbon and Energy version 3.0 (2019), 
published by BSRIA.
3. Scope 2 emissions data adopted the grid emission 
factors published by the Energy Commission 
Malaysia (2022) for operations in Malaysia. Scope 
2 emission factors in India are sourced from Central 
Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power India (2022).
4. The GHG emissions disclosures are independently 
verified according to ISO 14064:2018, in addition 
to data verification by the Group’s Internal Audit 
Department as part of the Sustainability Statement 
review.
5. Inter-divisional carbon emissions under Scope 
3 Category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) 
between the Group’s Construction, Property and 
Industry Divisions are eliminated to avoid double 
counting.

Operations [GRI 302-1, GRI 302-4]
In line with our R 2O commitments, 
IJM remains committed to implement 
initiatives to optimise energy usage, 
improve efficiency and reduce 
dependency on fossil fuels. We 
continue to increase our renewable 
energy generation capacity and 
explore more efficient processes and 
materials within our operations. 
ENVIRONMENT: OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
Our renewable energy generation 
capacity expanded to 8,050 kWp as 
a result of newly commissioned solar 
photovoltaic	(PV)	panels	at	ICP	Klang	
and	Kuantan	factories	under	Industry	
Division,	and	at	Kuantan	Port.	This	
contributed to the increase in our 
energy consumption from renewable 
sources	to	9,032.6	MWh.
We are actively expanding our 
renewable energy mix in line with 
our R2O commitment to achieve 
100% renewable electricity by 2035. 
While our efforts will focus on on-site 
generation, we are also exploring 
other mechanisms such as green 
tariffs and virtual power producing 
agreements, among others.
Note: 
•  Total energy consumption in FY2024 
includes petrol, diesel and natural gas

The Group has implemented 
effective approaches to reduce its 
direct emissions by adopting more 
efficient processes and phasing out 
high carbon fuels. In certain projects, 
the Construction Division leverages 
advanced BIM, including 4D 
simulations for detailed construction 
sequencing and 5D modelling 
for precise cost estimation. By 
optimising construction sequencing 
with 4D BIM, we minimise 
unnecessary transportation and 
on-site resource handling, thereby 
reducing fuel consumption and 
carbon emissions. Additionally, 5D 
BIM enhances logistics planning 
by accurately forecasting material 
needs and procurement schedules, 
further supporting our commitment to 
sustainable practices. Furthermore, 
the division is exploring the use of 
diesel with higher biofuel content 
at project sites while also exploring 
greener equipment and machinery.
The Industry Division utilises a 
boiler economiser at certain ICP 
factories, which captures heat from 
the exhaust flue and heats incoming

boiler economisers in ICP Nilai and 
ICP	Klang	factories	have	improved	
fuel efficiency for steam generation. 
Additionally, we completed 
the installation of solar thermal 
preheating system at ICP Senai 
factory in FY2024. The system uses 
solar energy to preheat incoming 
feedwater in boiler operations, which 
reduces the use of diesel.
The Port Division continues to 
optimise energy performance in line 
with	the	Kuantan	Green	Port	Initiative.	
The division established an internal 
procedure to prioritise the use of 
energy-efficient electrical equipment 
requiring that any procurement, such 
as air conditioners, electric fans, and 
televisions, must have an Energy 
Efficiency Label of 4 stars and 
above. Additionally, the installation 
of electric shore power supply at 
Kuantan	Port	has	seen	a	reduction	
of more than 34,106 litres of diesel 
usage by tugboats. This translated to 
an	emissions	reduction	of	92.0	tCO2e 
in FY2024 from the previous year. 
We continue to procure renewable 
energy certificates (“RECs”) for 
Menara Prudential. The RECs were 
acquired via regulated Tradable

ENVIRONMENT: OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
Facilitating Sustainable Buildings 
and Infrastructure
We are dedicated to embedding 
sustainable building and construction 
principles as a catalyst to fostering 
sustainable communities and 
mitigating the environmental impact 
of our products. 
The Construction Division is steadfast 
in advancing the use of alternative 
materials and innovative methods to 
minimise environmental impacts. We 
consistently seek opportunities to 
collaborate with clients, integrating 
sustainable design solutions in 
materials, construction methods, and 
utility designs to address operational 
and embodied emissions. 
The Property Division has 
implemented a Green Building 
Design Framework for residential 
landed and high-rise developments 
in Malaysia. This framework serves 
as a guideline to achieve GreenRE 
certification, with a minimum 
benchmark of a ‘Bronze’ certification 
for all new residential projects. This 
initiative requires the integration 
of energy-efficient and passive 
design strategies, water efficiency 
features, indoor environmental 
quality considerations, and various 
environmental protection elements, 
among others. 
IJM Group’s investment property, 
Menara Prudential, is a LEED gold-
certified building featuring several 
resource saving measures. The 
building incorporates efficient 
lighting and cooling systems 
which are monitored via a building 
management system. Smart meters 
and sensors are placed to maintain 
a favourable indoor environmental 
quality. Low emissivity glass and 
materials were used in its design to 
reduce building heat while captured 
rainwater and treated wastewater 
are used for non-potable purposes. 
Other sustainable features include its 
convenient location via a network of 
public transport amenities such as 
the MRT, and accessible facilities to 
cater for the disabled. 
In addition to green certifications, the 
Industry Division has progressively 
reduced the cement ratio of products 
by mixing cement alternatives and 
admixtures in the composition 
of concrete spun piles. Industrial 
by-products such as fly ash, 
ground granulated blast furnace 
slag (“GGBS”) along with quarry 
products such as limestone (“CCP”) 
have lower carbon footprint, while 
admixtures are used to quicken the 
concrete curing time. These cement 
replacers allow low carbon concrete 
production, aligning with the Group’s 
commitment under R2O to tackle 
Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions by 
expanding our low carbon products 
portfolio. 
In FY2024, the emissions from 
cement constituted 43.3% of the 
Group’s total emissions. The Industry 
Division made notable progress by 
replacing 12.8% of cement with non-
cementitious alternatives, thereby

MANAGING CLIMATE RISkS AND OPPORTUNITIES [GRI 201-2]
Climate-related risks are managed in line with the framework established in the Group’s ERM Policy. Specific parameters 
were established to assess the likelihood and impact of climate risks, given the longer time horizon. 
Following the climate risks and opportunities assessment, we have identified relevant climate risks that will likely impact 
IJM. We conducted a data-driven scenario analysis and a qualitative screening of the Group’s businesses and assets 
utilising two scenarios by the IPCC that were selected to assess physical risks. Transition risks were assessed against 
scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) and Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”).
Climate Scenarios Considered
Types of Risks and Opportunities Assessed
1 World Energy Outlook 2022, IEA          2  Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors, NGFS            3  IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Working Group I
Transition Risks and Opportunities
Transition risks are driven by 
changes in policies, market 
dynamics, regulatory changes, and 
technological advancements as the 
economy advances towards low 
carbon and net-zero emissions. 
Potential risks include increased 
operational costs due to higher 
raw material and fossil fuel prices, 
carbon taxes, and emissions 
trading schemes. Considerations 
also include policy restrictions on 
emissions, market perceptions, shifts 
in customer preferences, and the 
availability and demand of services. 
The Group’s assessment of 
transition risks and opportunities has 
incorporated the Divergent Net-Zero 
(1.5°C warming) and Announced 
Pledges (2°C warming) scenarios, 
using assumptions developed by the 
IEA and the NGFS, respectively. We 
have evaluated transition risks within 
a near-term horizon up to 2030 and 
a long-term horizon up to 2050, in 
alignment with global pledges and 
national commitments.
We evaluated the level of exposure 
and impact of transition risks and 
opportunities on the Group’s current 
and future operations in Malaysia 
and India. This assessment involved 
interviews and discussions with 
various management levels who 
influence the strategic direction of 
the Group’s businesses. 
Announced Pledges Scenario 
(“APS”) 
The APS scenario assumes that 
the Group’s position aligns with 
current global climate pledges and 
commitments, including nationally 
determined contributions (NDCs) 
and long-term net-zero targets, being 
fully achieved within the specified 
timeframe. This scenario projects 
a global temperature increases of 
1.7°C by 2100, resulting in moderate 
to severe physical risks and relatively 
low transition risks.
Divergent Net-Zero Scenario 
(“DNZ”) 
This scenario incorporates the most 
ambitious policies while taking into 
account for potential delays in the 
implementation of necessary actions.
The DNZ scenario achieves net-
zero emissions by 2050 and aligns 
with a climate goal that provides at 
least a 50% chance of limiting global 
warming to below 1.5°C by 2100. 
However, this scenario assumes 
higher costs compared to the Net-
Zero 2050 (NZE) scenario due to 
the implementation of divergent

policies across sectors and a more 
rapid phase-out of fossil fuels. 
Consequently, the DNZ scenario 
presents significantly higher 
transition risks and lower physical 
risks than the NZE scenario, owing 
to delayed or varied policy adoption 
across countries and sectors.
Our Findings
Our operations in Malaysia have 
been identified as having higher risk 
impacts compared to those in India, 
primarily due to stricter policies 
and regulations. The assessment 
indicates that regulatory and market 
risks are the foremost concerns likely 
to significantly affect our business. 
Under both the DNZ and APS 
scenarios, the Group’s exposure 
to regulatory risks in all divisions is 
heightened under both the DNZ and 
APS scenarios, spanning the near 
and long term. This primarily involves 
increased obligations for emissions 
reporting, carbon pricing initiatives, 
and regulatory mandates affecting 
our products and services.
In the long-term, the Property and 
Industry Divisions face significant 
long-term market risks under the 
DNZ scenario, while the Port Division 
experiences heightened exposure 
to these risks under both DNZ and 
APS scenarios. These market risks 
originate from escalating material 
costs and the evolving shift in 
customer preferences towards 
green or low-carbon developments, 
products, and services. 
Physical Risks and Opportunities
Physical risks are influenced by both 
acute and chronic climate patterns 
that could lead to infrastructure 
damage. Extreme weather could 
potentially cause temporary work 
stoppages and reduce productivity, 
which may lead to delays in the 
delivery of products and services. 
Our assessment referenced 
projections and data provided by 
the IPCC and the World Bank’s 
Climate	Change	Knowledge	Portal.	
The Group evaluated scenarios 
including worst-case (above 4°C 
warming) and current trajectory 
(2°C to 3°C warming). Parameters 
such as temperature variations, 
precipitation patterns, flood risks, 
and sea level rise across various 
regions and timeframes were 
analysed. We considered both near-
term projections up to 2030 and 
long-term projections up to 2070 to 
align with the duration of the Group’s 
concession assets.
A review was undertaken of the 
physical risks pertinent to major 
projects across nine locations, 
specifically	Selangor,	Kuala	Lumpur,	
Penang, Pahang, Johor, and Perak 
in	Malaysia,	 as	 well	 as	 Karnataka,	
Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh 
in India. The assessment involved 
examining existing risk registers 
and past climate-related incidents 
to evaluate the vulnerability of each 
asset. Location-specific climate 
projections were employed to gauge 
the probability and impact of climate 
stressors specific to each area. 
SSP2 – 4.5 (comparable to RCP4.5): 
2°C-3°C warming
This scenario represents the ‘most 
likely’ trajectory based on the 
current scale and pace of climate 
commitments. This scenario is 
employed to evaluate the most 
probable disruptions.
Referred to as the “middle-of-the-
road” scenario, emissions remain 
stable near current levels before 
gradually declining by mid-century 
but do not achieve net-zero by 2100. 
Under this scenario, temperatures 
are projected to increase by 
approximately 2.7°C by the end of 
the century. Socioeconomic factors 
continue along historical trends 
without significant deviations. 
Progress toward sustainability is 
sluggish, with uneven growth in 
development and income.
SSP5 – 8.5 (comparable to RCP8.5): 
above 4°C warming 
This scenario represents the 
‘business-as-usual’ trajectory 
resulting from global inaction, 
enabling the Group to evaluate 
potential disruptions in a worst-case 
scenario.
Referred to as the “fossil-fuel 
development” scenario, emissions 
continue to increase, doubling 
by 2050. Under this scenario, 
temperatures are projected to rise 
by approximately 4.4°C by the end 
of the century. The global economy 
experiences rapid growth, driven by 
the exploitation of fossil fuels and 
energy-intensive lifestyles.
Our Findings
Our organisation is expected to 
experience the effects of both acute 
and chronic physical climate events, 
as these impacts are anticipated to 
become increasingly severe and 
significant over time. Based on 
our assessment, certain assets, 
particularly	those	situated	in	Klang	
Valley and Pahang, have been 
identified as inherently vulnerable 
to pluvial flooding caused by heavy 
rainfall in the near term under both 
scenarios, reflecting their historical 
exposure to such events. 
Over the long term, our analysis has 
identified a heightened probability 
of coastal flooding due to sea level 
rise affecting assets and operations 
in coastal areas like Penang and 
Johor under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, 
whereas the SSP2-4.5 scenario 
indicates a slower onset. Moreover, 
the risk of heat stress is expected 
to escalate in both scenarios as 
temperatures chronically rise over 
time, potentially impacting the 
Group’s operations and productivity.

Limitations to Our Assessment
We recognise that climate risks are complex and evolving. The assessments conducted accounted for the direct impacts 
on the Group’s assets and operations, excluding systemic risks like food and water insecurity and public wellbeing. 
Addressing these broader implications requires a deeper understanding of the accumulation of different climate events 
on businesses and society. In this regard, a key initiative in our climate strategy is to form active partnerships with local 
governments, industry associations and likeminded stakeholders to address systemic climate risks.
Importantly, each of the climate scenarios also present opportunities across various time horizons. These include asset and 
operational efficiencies through improved design and planning, adoption of innovative technology, the use of low carbon 
materials, and leveraging on government incentives. We will continue to explore the significance of these opportunities to 
drive longer-term positive change and strengthen our business and value chain resilience.

The increasing frequency and 
severity of extreme weather 
events are a direct consequence 
of overshooting the 1.5°C global 
warming limit. This limit represents 
a biophysical threshold beyond 
which the risk of triggering multiple 
tipping points in the Earth system 
becomes significantly higher. These 
tipping points can initiate tipping 
cascades, where the activation 
of one tipping point increases 
Planetary health, the state of 
Earth’s natural systems and their 
capacity to sustain life, is intricately 
connected to our ability to mitigate 
climate change. Scientific evidence 
highlights that six out of nine 
Planetary Boundaries have already 
been transgressed. Understanding 
and addressing these systemic 
risks is essential for achieving 
net-zero emissions by 2050. 
According to the research, the likely 
remaining pathways to achieving 
a 1.5-degree scenario, which will 
involve overshoot and subsequent 
reduction, will be preconditioned 
upon a healthy planetary ecosystem.
The Planetary Boundaries 
framework identifies nine critical 
processes that regulate Earth’s 
stability and resilience. These 
include climate change, biodiversity 
loss, biogeochemical flows (nitrogen 
and phosphorus cycles), ocean 
acidification, land-system change, 
freshwater use, atmospheric aerosol 
loading, and novel entities (such as 
chemical pollution). Crossing these 
boundaries increases the risk of 
triggering large-scale, abrupt, or 
irreversible environmental changes.
Planetary boundaries
the likelihood of others being 
triggered. For example, the loss 
of polar ice represents a positive 
feedback loop where ice-free 
seas absorb more solar radiation, 
further warming the water. This 
warming accelerates the release 
of methane trapped in the 
thawing permafrost, which in turn 
exacerbates global warming in a 
self-reinforcing cycle.

The IPCC and climate models 
provide compelling evidence 
that the health of our planet 
is inextricably linked to our 
climate goals. Corporates 
and governments must take 
bold, science-based actions 
to address the systemic 
risks posed by transgressing 
planetary boundaries.

Achieving a net-zero future is 
an ambitious but necessary 
goal, one that requires a holistic 
approach that integrates 
planetary health into every facet 
of corporate strategies and 
government agenda. Failing 
to address these systemic 
risks could undermine efforts 
to achieve net-zero, with 
dire consequences for both 
businesses and society.

Responsible Water Management
We are dedicated to maximising 
water efficiency across all our 
businesses and have implemented 
measures to reduce water usage 
in our operations. In FY2024, the 
Group’s water withdrawal decreased 
by	16.9%	to	1,011,476.0	m3.
To reduce our reliance on ground, 
surface, and municipal water 
sources, we collect rainwater 
across the Property, Industry, Port, 
and Toll Divisions. In FY2024, we 
harvested	 2,904.0m³	 of	 rainwater	
for non-potable uses, including 
cleaning	and	landscaping.	Kuantan	
Port collaborated with a tenant to 
enhance water efficiency by reusing 
treated water. 
We enforce effective control 
measures to ensure compliance with 
water quality and quantity permits, 
standards, and regulations. Notably, 
in FY2024, there were no recorded 
instances of non-compliance with 
water quality standards. 
Water treatment facilities are 
strategically installed at high-
discharge sites to manage 
wastewater and adhere to voluntary 
and regulatory environmental 
standards. These facilities employ 
chemical agents to reduce 
suspended solids to below 50 mg/
litre before discharging into the 
public drainage system. Utilising a 
flocculation process, as seen at the 
TRX Residences site, these plants 
effectively separate suspended 
particles, facilitating easier filtration 
before discharge. Project sites with 
lower water discharges employ 
traditional water treatment methods 
like silt traps and sedimentation 
ponds. In certain instances, treated 
water is recycled and reused at 
project sites and factories.

Environmental Pollution 
Management
IJM is committed to preventing air, 
noise, waste, and water pollution 
across our operations. In FY2024, all 
divisions achieved ISO 14001:2015 
Environmental Management 
Systems certification, covering 
100% of our operations in Malaysia. 
Aligned with ISO 14001:2015, 
our Group’s Health, Safety, and 
Environment (HSE) Management 
System outlines comprehensive 
environmental monitoring and 
pollution management protocols.  
This system guides the 
implementation of our Environmental 
Management Procedures and 
Operation Specific Plans, enabling 
us to identify, evaluate, and mitigate 
pollution risks and minimise the 
impact of our operations on the 
environment and surrounding 
communities. 
Across our operations, we adopt 
suitable practices to manage erosion 
and	sedimentation.	 Key	 measures,	
including groundcover, turfing, 
vegetation, and hydroseeding, are 
employed to prevent soil erosion. 
Additionally, temporary check dams, 
silt traps, and fences are installed 
to prevent the pollution of water 
sources. 
To manage noise and vibration 
pollution from our operations, we 
have installed meters  at our sites 
for continuous monitoring. Vibration 
meters at quarries ensure minimal 
disturbance to surrounding areas, 
in adherence with the Environmental 
Quality	Act	1974.	Air	pollution	risks	
are addressed through ongoing 
monitoring and inspections at project 
sites. The Port Division has installed 
dust barriers and fog cannons to 
mitigate air pollution. Washing bays 
were provided to clean cargo trucks 
before they access public roads, 
and road sweepers and water trucks 
were deployed to manage dust levels 
within the port area. 
In FY2024, there were no major 
incidents and penalties due to 
spillage.

comply with local waste regulations 
while continuously working towards 
managing waste beyond this 
minimum threshold. Waste reduction 
is one of the key measures in our 
climate strategy to achieve Scope 
3 emissions reduction. Our target 
is to reduce wastes generated from

We implement proactive measures 
across all our operations to minimise 
waste disposed to the landfills by 
recycling and reusing the waste we 
generate. In FY2024, 10.6% of our 
waste was reused or recycled.
Solid or non-scheduled wastes are 
segregated at the point of generation 
with designated collection areas. 
We appoint licensed contractors 
to dispose and recycle waste at 
accredited facilities. Recycling 
and reusing of construction 
waste are prioritised for practical 
implementation at sites, for instance, 
concrete waste is crushed and 
repurposed to stabilise road access 
to sites. In FY2024, waste that have 
been diverted from landfill, which 
includes recycled waste, and treated 
waste off-site and on-site, amounted 
to	12,379.1	tonnes.
The Construction Division established 
a Waste Reduction Framework in 
FY2023, in line with the Group’s 
Sustainability Roadmap FY2023 to 
FY2025. The framework guides the 
management and reduction of solid 
wastes within operations. In FY2024, 
a few projects were selected as pilot 
projects to initiate the implementation 
of the Waste Reduction Framework 
which include waste segregation, 
reusing and recycling of construction 
waste material. 
Unused concrete is repurposed at 
the Industry Division’s IBS factory 
by segregating sand, aggregates, 
and slurry effluents through a 
reclaimer, effectively optimising 
material usage and enhancing cost 
efficiency. Excess water is collected 
and separated from slurry effluents, 
then reused for concrete batching, 
sprinkler systems, and cleaning 
purposes.
The Toll Division is exploring the 
use of mill waste from the existing 
pavement and resurfacing as 
compaction material to stabilise soil 
before road overlay works. Reusing 
milled waste from pavement repair 
offers several advantages. It reduces 
the need for new raw materials, 
conserving natural resources 
and lowering project costs. This 
recycling process decreases landfill 
waste, promoting environmental 
sustainability. Reclaimed asphalt 
pavement (RAP) can enhance the 
performance of new asphalt mixtures, 
providing durability and stability. 
Additionally, utilising RAP minimises 
the energy consumption and 
emissions associated with producing 

---- Page 175 ----
SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT ANNUAL REPORT 2024
173
new materials, contributing to a 
reduction in the carbon footprint of 
pavement rehabilitation. Reusing 
milling waste supports eco-friendly 
practices, cost-efficiency, and the 
creation of high-quality, sustainable 
pavements. 
Scheduled and hazardous waste 
are managed and disposed 
of in adherence to safety and 
environmental legislations. These 
wastes are securely stored in 
designated areas, labelled with 
precise guidelines and specification. 
The Group engages licensed 
contractors to dispose of scheduled 
waste at approved treatment 
facilities. In FY2024, there were 
no fines of non-compliance with 
environmental laws and regulations 
relating to handling of scheduled 
waste.
CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY  
[GRI 304-1, 304-3]
We appreciate the value that 
nature provides and recognise the 
importance of conserving natural 
Sebana Cove, Johor, located next to the biodiversity-rich Sungai Santi forest reserve
ecosystems to ensure business 
resilience. Our commitment 
includes minimising our impact on 
the surrounding environment in 
our operational areas, responsibly 
managing natural resources, and, 
when feasible, undertaking initiatives 
to conserve biodiversity. 
Biodiversity loss and ecosystem 
collapse are recognised as 
among the fastest-rising global 
risks in the coming decade. 
The Group acknowledges the 
growing significance of integrating 
nature-related risks into business 
strategies for long-term viability, 
safeguarding profitability, and 
ensuring a sustainable future for both 
businesses and the environment. 
We will explore the intricate 
interdependencies between nature 
and business using the Taskforce on 
Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) framework, evaluating how 
these connections translate into a 
wider gamut of financial risks.
All projects exceeding 50 hectares 
must undergo an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) to evaluate 
biodiversity within their boundaries 
and propose measures to mitigate 
disturbances to the natural 
environment. We strive to incorporate 
regenerative practices where 
possible across our operations. The 
Property Division has established 
an internal goal to integrate green 
spaces into their developments that 
surpass the minimum requirements 
mandated by local councils. 
The Property Division is presently 
exploring the support of two 
biodiversity-rich locations that are 
adjacent to their developments. 
The support may potentially include 
allocating development land bank, 
providing access infrastructure, 
creating gallery space, conducting 
biodiversity audits, and collaborating 
with local academia and non-profit 
organisations. Further details will be 
provided as these projects progress.

Fostering an Engaged Workforce
Fostering an engaged workforce 
is integral to our corporate culture. 
We are committed to attracting, 
developing, and retaining top talent 
to drive our business growth and 
innovation. In FY2024, we conducted 
an extensive employee engagement 
survey, MyVoice, the first survey 
post-COVID that was constructive 
to understand and address the 
evolving needs and sentiments of 
our employees.

Engaging Senior Leaders
townhall with Senior Leadership
In FY2024, IJM Group and business 
divisions conducted respective 
townhall meetings that served as 
a crucial platform for fostering 
transparent communication between 
senior leadership and employees. 
The primary purpose of these 
townhalls is to ensure that every 
employee is well-informed about 
the Company’s strategic direction 
and the steps necessary to achieve 
organisational goals. 
Townhall meetings collectively contribute to a motivated and well-informed workforce, ready to drive the Company towards achieving its strategic goals
Expanding Leadership Horizons
Fostering synergy and growth through leadership and collaboration
While providing employees with 
direct access to senior leaders, the 
townhall meetings also allowed 
for an open exchange of ideas, 
concerns, and feedback. Several key 
points were highlighted during the 
townhall meetings, showcasing the 
effectiveness of these engagements. 
Senior leaders have taken the 
initiative to clearly articulate how the 
Group and business divisions plan 
to execute their various strategies, 
ensuring that all employees 
understand their role in this journey.
Such interactions not only provide 
clarity on the Company’s strategy but 
also align everyone’s efforts towards 
common objectives, enhancing 
overall organisational cohesion and 
morale.
Our senior leaders immersed 
themselves in a dynamic leadership 
workshop that also served as an 
integrative platform to explore 
ideas and foster alignment with 
the Group’s strategy. Emphasising 
crucial frameworks and concepts, 
the workshop further broadened 
their perspectives, envisioning new 
possibilities and innovative solutions 
for the Group. The engagement that 
shared best practices and successful 
business models created potential 
synergies within the Group crucial for 
the sustained growth of the Company 
and our diverse businesses.

Human Resources
Our approach identifies and nurtures 
future leaders, ensuring business 
continuity and sustained growth. 
We maintain our competitive edge 
by systematically preparing for 
future leadership needs, mitigating 
risks associated with leadership 
gaps. The process typically involves 
identifying potential employees 
within the organisation and providing 
them with the necessary training and 
development to manage and lead 
the Company effectively in the future.
The process begins with 
the nomination of potential 
successors by senior leaders, 
followed by comprehensive  
assessments that include tools like 
the Psychometrics Assessment 
and Performance Data Analysis. 
These assessments are plotted 
into a 9-box matrix, evaluating 
both performance and potential of 
nominated successors. The matrix 
helps in categorising employees into 
various levels to facilitate targeted 
development plans.
Post-assessment, the Group’s 
elected Talent Council reviews and 
calibrates the findings, ensuring 
a balanced perspective on each 
candidate. Identified talents undergo 
development interventions tailored to 
their specific needs, which includes 
on-the-job learning, targeted 
training programmes, and executive 
coaching and mentoring. Progress 
is continuously tracked to ensure 
readiness for future roles.
Our approach emphasises the 
70/20/10  development  model, 
where 70% of learning is  
on-the-job, 20% from interactions 
with others, and 10% through formal 
education, ensuring a holistic growth 
environment.

Leadership Development Programmes
LEad Managerial Curriculum Graduate associate Programme
The LEAD programme aims to 
cultivate people management 
skills essential for building and 
managing internal teams and 
external partners. The programme 
facilitates the transfer of industry 
experience and knowledge through 
mentorship from across divisions, 
industries and countries, ensuring 
a well-rounded leadership pipeline. 
A blended approach focusing on 
leadership helps identify and retain 
potential future leaders.
The Managerial Curriculum is 
specifically designed to develop 
and strengthen the competencies 
of people managers at every level, 
empowering them with the tools 
and knowledge to drive results, 
build effective teams, and navigate 
managerial responsibilities.
The GAP provides scholarship 
recipients with the opportunity to 
gain familiarity with key functions 
within IJM through departmental 
rotations, offering diverse and 
comprehensive exposure. By 
experiencing different roles and 
departments, GAP participants 
develop a holistic understanding 
of IJM’s operations, fostering their 
growth and preparing them for future 
roles within the company.

Occupational Safety and Health 
At IJM, we place significant 
importance on our occupational 
health and safety standards. 
In FY2024, all active projects 
at the Construction Division,  
ICP factories of the Industry Division 
and Port Division continued to 
be ISO 45001:2018 certified, and 
their safety and health data were 
audited and verified by Standard 
and Industrial Research Institute 
of Malaysia (“SIRIM”), except for 
Port Division that was verified by 
TUV Nord.  We achieved zero non-
conformity in the independent audit 
conducted by SIRIM. In addition, 
our Toll Division was awarded with 
the ISO 45001: 2018 certification.  
The certification recognises the 
highways operator’s efforts and 
initiatives on safeguarding the 
workforce and other stakeholders’ 
health and safety.
Our initiatives aim to promote a 
strong safety culture. Our proactive 
approach includes regular audits, 
risk assessments, and continuous 
improvement processes. Additionally, 
our joint management-employee 
health and safety committees at 
project sites ensure the involvement 
from employees of all levels and 
the management in discussing and 
addressing OSH issues. Health, 
Safety, and Environment (“HSE”) 
Committees are also present in all 
divisions and locations to oversee 
HSE matters.
In FY2024, we enhanced the 
HSE Management System 
by developing the IJM HSE 
Minimum Requirement Handbook.  
This guide covers the pre-
commencement processes, high-
risk activities, and operational 
requirements, all aimed at elevating 
the minimum standards for 
operational practices. Additionally,

Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors is our top priority. We have implemented a 
comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) management system that aligns with international standards 
and best practices. We implement our safety policy and conduct regular training programmes to minimise risks and create 
a secure working environment. 
we integrated the Safe Work 
Method Statement into our Hazard

We conducted several workshop 
sessions with internal stakeholders 
across the Construction Division to 
ensure thorough understanding and 
implementation of our updated safety 
processes, ensuring a cohesive and 
informed approach to HSE practices.
The Construction, Industry, 
and Port Divisions comply  
with the OSH (Use and Standard of 
Exposure of Chemicals Hazardous 
to Health) Regulation 2000 through 
Chemical Health Risk Assessments 
(CHRA) for both ongoing and new

WORKPLACE: EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE
The Organisational Context, Risk, 
and Opportunities process is 
executed to facilitate strategic 
planning and ensure full compliance 
and high level of performance 
across all workplaces. By managing 
OSH hazards, environmental 
aspects, and operational risks and 
opportunities throughout the project 
lifecycle, especially during the 
design and pre-construction stages,  
we effectively minimise the potential 
for accidents and environmental 
pollution. 
The Toll Division conducts a 
comprehensive Road Safety Audit 
(Stage 5) every three years and 
follows through with improvement 
and enhancement works based on 
the findings and assessments of 
traffic experts to ensure road users’ 
safety along our highways. Extensive 
periodical inspection such as the 
Lumen test for street lighting system 
and reflectivity test for road signages 
and road line marking were executed 
to monitor system effectiveness and 
ensure road visuality and driving 
safety.
In FY2024, the division 
proposed a road widening  
upgrade at our BESRAYA highway, 
which aims to mitigate traffic 
weaving issues and improve 
mainline traffic capacity. This is 
targeted for completion by October  
2024. In addition, four new 
motorcycle shelters were constructed 
along our highways. These shelters 
provide protection for motorcyclists 
during adverse weather conditions, 
ensuring they have a safe place to 
stop during bad weather. 
We gradually implemented other 
road safety measures such as 
the installation of new W-Beam 
guardrails, additional guardrail 
posts, New Jersey Barriers,  
anti-skid transverse bars, new 
rumble strips, high performance road 
line marking and supplementary road 
signages at key locations. These 
initiatives highlight our commitment 
to provide a secure and reliable 
travel experience through regular 
assessment and improvement to our 
highway infrastructure. 
Constant monitoring and close 
collaboration with  third-party project 
owners along the highways are 
crucial to ensure strict adherence to 
road safety guidelines and operating 
procedures, as ongoing project works 
may adversely affect the highways’ 
traffic flow or be harmful to the safety 
of road users. In FY2024, several 
significant development projects 
progressed well along the corridor 
of our highways. They include the 
completion of the Mass Rapid Transit 
(MRT) Putrajaya Line Phase 2, Sungai  
Besi-Ulu Kelang Expressway (SUKE), 
Setiawangsa-Pantai Expressway 
(SPE), and the Langat 2 water 
treatment plant project.

implemented a corrective action 
plan to prevent similar incidents in 
the future. The division implemented 
a new pile stacking method that 
incorporates the use of a lock plate 
for enhanced stability and safety 
during pile transfer activities. 
In December 2023, a worker was 
electrocuted while performing tack 
welding works at a project site. The 
Construction Division conducted 
a safety stand-down with the work 
contractor and operation team 
to assess operational controls 
and prevent similar incidents. A 
safe operating procedure was 
implemented for welding works 
involving mobile distribution boards. 
Additionally, all electrical tools were 
reinspected to ensure they were in 
good condition.
Regular site consultation and internal 
audit programmes are conducted 
to monitor the effectiveness of the 
HSE management system, while 
providing guidance to improve 
on performance. In FY2024, the 
Construction Division conducted 
a total of 44 HSE consultation 
programmes and 16 internal audits 
that determined necessary actions to 
correct non-compliance and tackle 
issues based on the root cause.

Festive Giving
 Each year, the Group organises a series 
of charitable initiatives to illuminate the 
lives of underprivileged families during 
significant festive seasons throughout 
the year. In FY2024, the Property 
Division contributed more than 
RM82,000 worth of cash donations, 
daily essentials, and groceries to low-
income households. This not only 
alleviated their circumstances but also 
ensured that their festivities were filled 
with warmth, joy and support. 
 The Toll and Port Divisions collectively 
contributed more than RM28,000 for 
various community service initiatives 
during the month of Ramadan, such as 
organising a Bubur Lambuk distribution 
and	purchasing	livestock	for	Hari	Raya	
Haji	 Korban	 for	 distribution	to	 the	
less fortunate. These initiatives help 
build community solidarity within the 
communities we operate in, fostering 
a more inclusive and compassionate

Fundraising Initiatives
Our Property Division contributed 
RM50,000 to Dama Asia’s fundraising 
initiative for two of their most 
acclaimed musicals, All That Glitz 
& Glamour and In Perfect Harmony, 
Too. This collaboration, which 
supports local talent, is aligned to 
our focus on social inclusion and 
community resilience. Our support 
is aimed at helping Dama Asia and 
emerging Malaysian performing 
talents return to the stage, enriching 
the cultural landscape and nurturing 
arts in Malaysia. The outcome of our 
support is visible in the successful 
staging of these musicals and the 
funds raised for Dama Asia’s future 
endeavours, ensuring that arts 
continue to thrive in Malaysia.
 In March 2024, we supported the 
Children’s Protection Society’s 
Fundraising Gala 2024. The non-
profit organisation provides a safe 
and nurturing environment for over 
30 at-risk and vulnerable children, 
focusing on their emotional, physical, 
and educational development. Funds 
raised will go towards educational 
programmes, social skill development, 
and recreational activities, all of which 
are crucial for the healthy growth and 
future success of the children .

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(a) to ascertain the action taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful debts 
and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made 
for doubtful debts; and
(b) to ensure that any current assets, other than debts, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of 
business including the value of current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company 
had been written down to an amount which the current assets might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report and statement, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(a) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts of the 
Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent and the values attributed to current assets of the 
Group and of the Company misleading; or
(b) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and 
of the Company misleading or inappropriate; or
(c) not otherwise dealt with in this report and statement or in the financial statements that would render any amount 
stated in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.
At the date of this report and statement, neither any charge on the assets of the Group and the Company has arisen 
since the end of the financial year which secures the liability of any other person nor any contingent liability of the Group  
and the Company.

results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year.
No contingent or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable 
within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may

sUMMaRY OF MateRIaL aCCOUntInG  
POLICIes 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
The following material accounting policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented in dealing with items 
which are considered material in relation to the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian 
Financial Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated in this 
summary of material accounting policies.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reported period. It also requires Management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying 
the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgement are based on the 
Management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements.
The Group and the Company adopted the following Standard, Amendments to Standards.
(a) Amendments to published standards that are effective
 The amendments to published standards that are effective for the Group’s and the Company’s financial  
year beginning on 1 April 2023 and applicable to the Group and the Company are as follows:
•	 MFRS	17	 Insurance	 Contracts	 and	 its	 amendments	 –	 Initial Application of MFRS 17 and MFRS 9 –  
Comparative Information
•	 Amendments	to	 MFRS	 101	 Presentation	 of	 Financial	 Statements	 and	 MFRS	 Practice	 Statement	 2	 –	 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies 
•	 Amendments	to	 MFRS	 108	 Accounting	 Policies,	 Changes	 in	 Accounting	 Estimates	 and	 Errors	 –	 
Definition of Accounting Estimates
•	 Amendments	to	MFRS	112	Income	Taxes	–	Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a  
Single Transaction 
•	 Amendments	to	MFRS	112	Income	Taxes	–	International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules *
 The adoption of amendments to published standards listed above did not have any material impact on the 
current financial year or any prior financial year.
* In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) issued Pillar Two 
model rules which are also commonly known as Global Minimum Tax (“GMT”). The Government of Malaysia 
has gazetted the Finance (No.2) Act 2023 in December 2023 which sets out, amongst others, the legislative 
provisions of the OECD’s Pillar Two model rules and will be effective for financial years beginning on or after  
1 January 2025.
	 Amendments	to	 MFRS	 112	 “International	 Tax	 Reform	 –	 Pillar	 Two	 Model	 Rules”	 provide	 a	 mandatory	
temporary exception from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from enacted or 
substantively enacted tax law that implements the Pillar Two model rules, including tax law that implements 
qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes described in those rules.
 The Group is within the scope of the OECD’s Pillar Two model rules. The Group operates in certain jurisdictions, 
namely United Kingdom (“UK”) where the legislation to implement the OECD’s Pillar Two model rules has been 
enacted in July 2023 and effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 31 December 2023. In 
accordance with the transition provisions, the Group has applied the temporary exception in the amendments 
retrospectively and not accounting for deferred taxes arising from the top-up tax due to the Pillar Two model 
rules in the consolidated financial statements. 
 The Group is in the process of assessing the full impact of Pillar Two income taxes arising from the legislation 
enacted or substantively enacted but not yet in effect.

1 BASIS OF PREPARATION (cont’d)
(b) Standard and amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company, but are  
not yet effective and have not been early adopted
(i) The amendments to published standards that are mandatory for the Group’s and the Company’s financial 
year beginning on 1 April 2024 and the Group and the Company have not early adopted are as follows*:
•	 Amendments	on	classification	of	liabilities	as	current	or	non-current	(Amendments	to	MFRS	101)
 The MFRS 101 classification principle requires an assessment of whether an entity has the substantive 
right to defer settlement of a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.  
 The first amendments clarify that when the right to defer settlement is subject to complying with specified 
conditions, the right only exists at the end of the reporting period if the entity complies with those 
conditions at that date. The entity must comply with the conditions at the end of the reporting period 
even if the lender does not test compliance until a later date. 
 The assessment of whether an entity has the right to defer settlement of a liability at reporting date is not 
affected by expectations of the entity or events after the reporting date (e.g. waiver obtained or breach of 
loan covenant).
 The second amendments, “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants” specify that covenants of loan 
arrangements which an entity must comply with only after the reporting date would not affect classification 
of a liability as current or non-current at the reporting date. However, those covenants that an entity is 
required to comply with on or before the reporting date would affect classification of a liability as current 
or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the reporting date. 
 Both amendments shall be applied retrospectively.
•	 Amendments	on	lease	liability	in	a	sale	and	leaseback	(Amendments	to	MFRS	16)
 The amendments specify the measurement of the lease liability arises in a sale and leaseback  
transaction that satisfies the requirements in MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” to be 
accounted for as a sale. In accordance with the amendments, the seller-lessee shall determine the “lease 
payments” or “revised lease payments” in a way that it does not result in the seller-lessee recognising 
any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains.
•	 Amendments	to	MFRS	107	Statement	of	Cash	Flows	and	MFRS	7	Financial	Instruments:	Disclosures	–	
Supplier Finance Arrangements
 The amendments introduce new disclosures on quantitative and qualitative information relating to 
supplier finance arrangements (“SFA”) to enhance the transparency of supplier finance arrangements 
and assist users of the financial statement to assess the effects of these arrangements on an entity’s 
liabilities and cash flows and on an entity’s exposure to liquidity risk.
 The amendments require the following information about SFA to be disclosed in the annual period in 
which the amendments are first applied:
(A) the terms and conditions of SFAs; 
(B) the carrying amount of financial liabilities that are part of SFAs and the line items in which those 
liabilities are presented;
(C) the carrying amount of the financial liabilities in (B) for which suppliers have already received  
payment from the finance providers;
(D) the range of payment due dates for both the financial liabilities that are part of SFAs, and comparable 
trade payables that are not part of such arrangements;
(E) the type and effect of non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of the financial liabilities that are 
part of SFAs; and
(F) liquidity risk information (e.g. concentration of risks; access to SFA facilities for liquidity requirement).

(b) Standard and amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company, but are  
not yet effective and have not been early adopted (cont’d)
(ii) The amendments to published standards that are mandatory for the Group’s and the Company’s financial 
year beginning on 1 April 2025 and the Group and the Company have not early adopted are as follows*: 
•	 Amendments	to	MFRS	121	The	Effects	of	Changes	in	Foreign	Exchange	Rates	–	Lack	of	Exchangeability
 The amendments clarify that a currency is exchangeable when an entity is able to exchange it into 
another currency within a time frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and through a market 
or exchange mechanism that creates enforceable rights and obligations. If an entity can only obtain 
no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency at the measurement date for the specified 
purpose, then the currency is not exchangeable. In such cases, the entity is required to estimate the spot 
exchange rate at the measurement date.
 The amendments do not specify how an entity estimates the spot exchange rate, but permit an entity 
to use observable exchange rate without adjustment or another estimation technique, provided it could 
meet the objective for estimating the spot exchange rate set out in the amendments.
(iii) The new accounting standard that is mandatory for the Group’s and the Company’s financial year beginning 
on 1 April 2027 and the Group and the Company have not early adopted is as follows*:
 MFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements 
 MFRS 18 replaces MFRS 101 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The key new concepts introduced in 
MFRS 18 are:
•	 New	structure	of	profit	or	loss	statement
a  Categories: Income and expenses are classified into 3 main categories: operating, investing and 
financing:
(i)   Operating category: This category typically includes the entity’s results from its main business 
activities.
(ii)  Investing category: This category typically includes the results of investments in associates and 
joint ventures and other assets that generate a return largely independently of other resources. 
(iii) Financing category: This category includes all income and expenses from financing liabilities 
(such as bank borrowings and lease liabilities).
b   Required subtotals: Entities are required to present specified subtotals: ‘Operating profit or loss’  
and ‘Profit or loss before financing and income taxes’.
•	 Management-defined	performance	measures	(MPMs),	i.e.	a	subtotal	of	income	and	expenses	that	
an entity uses to communicate the performance of the entity to the users of financial statements,  
are required to be disclosed in a single note to the financial statements.  MPMs should also be reconciled 
to the most similar specified subtotal in MFRS Accounting Standards.
•	 	Enhanced	principles	on	aggregation	and	disaggregation	which	focus	on	grouping	items	based	on	their	
shared characteristics.
This new Standard should be applied retrospectively, including for interim financial statements.
* These standard and amendments to published standards will be adopted on the respective  effective dates. The Group 
and the Company have started a preliminary assessment on the effects of the above standard and amendments to 
published standards and the impact is still being assessed.

2 ECONOMIC ENTITIES IN THE GROUP
(a) Subsidiaries
 Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls 
an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.
 The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Group controls 
another entity. In assessing whether potential voting rights contribute to control, the Group examines all facts 
and circumstances (including the terms of exercise of the potential voting rights and any other contractual 
arrangements whether considered individually or in combination) that affect potential voting rights.
 Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are 
deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for 
business combinations when the acquired sets of activities and assets meet the definition of a business.  
The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include 
an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The 
acquisition would be classified as acquisition of assets if definition of business is not met. An entity has an option 
to apply a “concentration test” that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities 
and assets is not a business. Under the concentration test, the acquisition would not represent a business if 
substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or 
group of similar assets. An entity may elect to apply the concentration test separately for each transaction.
 Under the acquisition method of accounting, the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary 
is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or 
liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and fair value of any pre-existing equity interest 
in the subsidiary. The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at 
their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the 
acquiree	over	the	fair	value	of	the	identifiable	net	assets	acquired	is	recognised	as	goodwill	–	See	accounting	
policy 3 on goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously 
held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a 
bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.
 If the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity 
interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition dates, and any gains or losses arising from 
such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.
 The Group applies predecessor accounting to account for business combinations under common control. 
Under predecessor accounting, assets and liabilities acquired are not restated to their respective fair values 
but at the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate holding company of the 
Group and adjusted to conform with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. The difference between 
any consideration given and the aggregate carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of 
transaction) of the acquired entity is recognised as an adjustment to equity. No additional goodwill is recognised. 
The acquired entity’s results, assets and liabilities are consolidated as if both the acquirer and the acquiree had 
always been combined. Consequently, the consolidated financial statements reflect both entities’ full year’s 
results. The comparative information is restated to reflect the combined results of both entities.
 Non-controlling interest represents that portion of profit or loss and net assets of a subsidiary attributable to 
equity interests that are not owned, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, by the Company. It is measured 
on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share 
of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition and the non-controlling 
interests’ share of changes in the subsidiaries’ equity since that date.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
2 ECONOMIC ENTITIES IN THE GROUP (cont’d)
(a) Subsidiaries (cont’d)
 All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the owners of the Company and the non-controlling 
interests, even if the attribution of losses to the non-controlling interests results in a debit balance in the  
total equity.
 Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of financial position 
respectively.
 All inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated except for contracted finished goods which are stated at net realisable value. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency of accounting 
policies with those of the Group.
(b) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control 
 Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions 
with equity owners of the Group.  A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying 
amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary.  
Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or 
received is recognised in equity attributable to owners of the Group.
(c) Disposal of subsidiaries
 When the Group ceases to consolidate because of a loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is  
remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes 
the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, 
joint venture or financial asset.  In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. 
This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit  
or loss. In addition, any capital reserves associated with the subsidiary will be reclassified to retained profits.
 Gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the  
subsidiaries sold.
(d) Associates
 Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control,  
generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. The existence and 
the effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the group exercises significant 
influence over another entity. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the associates but not the power to exercise control over those policies.
 Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, 
the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost, and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s 
share of the post-acquisition profit or loss of the associate in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements 
in other comprehensive income of the associate in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or 
receivable from an associate are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The 
Group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.
 When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interests in the associate, including any 
long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate, the Group does 
not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate.

Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024
25
2 ECONOMIC ENTITIES IN THE GROUP (cont’d)
(d) Associates (cont’d)
 The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in 
the associate is impaired. An impairment is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the 
associate exceeds its recoverable amount and the amount is recognised in profit or loss.
 Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associates; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides 
evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The Group eliminates the downstream 
intercompany transactions with the associate by adjusting against the Group’s revenue and cost of sales in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
 When the Group ceases to equity account its associate because of a loss of significant influence, any retained 
interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or 
loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the 
retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amount previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income in respect of the entity is accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to 
profit or loss.
 If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate 
share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where 
appropriate.
 For incremental interest in an associate when significant influence is retained, the date of acquisition is the 
purchase date at each stage and goodwill is calculated at each purchase date based on the fair value of assets 
and liabilities identified.  The previously held interest is not re-measured.
(e) Joint arrangements
 A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group 
with one or more parties, where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation 
or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint venture is a 
joint arrangement whereby the joint venturers have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint operation 
is a joint arrangement whereby the joint operators have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement.
(i) Joint ventures
 Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at 
cost in the consolidated statement of financial position. Under the equity method, the investment in a joint 
venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-
acquisition profits or losses of the joint venture in profit or loss, and the Group’s share of movements in 
other comprehensive income of the joint venture in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or 
receivable from a joint venture are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. When 
the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equal or exceed its interests in the joint ventures, including 
any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures, the 
Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of the joint ventures.
 The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in 
the joint venture is impaired. An impairment is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of 
the joint venture exceeds its recoverable amount and the amount is recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
2 ECONOMIC ENTITIES IN THE GROUP (cont’d)
(e) Joint arrangements (cont’d)
(i) Joint ventures (cont’d)
 Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent 
of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction 
provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures 
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.  
The Group eliminates the downstream intercompany transactions with the joint venture by adjusting against 
the Group’s revenue and cost of sales in the statement of comprehensive income.
 When the Group ceases to equity account its joint venture because of a loss of joint control, any retained 
interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or 
loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the 
retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amount previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income in respect of the entity is accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets 
or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to profit or loss.
 If the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share 
of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where 
appropriate.
(ii) Joint operations
 In relation to the Group’s interest in the joint operations, the Group recognises its direct right to the assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements under the 
appropriate headings.
3 GOODWILL
 Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregate of fair value of  
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of any 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed on the acquisition date. If the fair value of consideration transferred, the amount of non-controlling interest 
and the fair value of previously held interest in the acquiree are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
of the acquiree, the resulting gain is recognised in profit or loss.
 Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in the statement of financial position as intangible assets. Goodwill 
is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that it might be impaired, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment.
 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the 
cash generating units (“CGUs”), or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents 
the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is 
monitored at each business segment. The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in 
which it operates. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value 
in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed. 
 Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
 Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures and associates is included in investments in joint ventures and associates 
respectively.  Such goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the total carrying value.

Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

4 INVESTMENTS
 In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are 
carried at cost less accumulated impairment. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of 
the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount.  See accounting policy 25 on 
impairment of non-financial assets. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, the 
difference between disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in profit or loss.
 The amounts due from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates of which the Company does not expect repayment 
in the foreseeable future are considered as part of the Company’s investments in the subsidiaries, joint ventures and 
associates.
 Long term investments are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These are 
initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs and subsequently, at fair value, with the changes in fair value 
recognised in other comprehensive income. These are included in non-current assets unless management intends 
to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date. 
 Short term investments in marketable securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
and measured at fair value on the date a transaction is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value 
with the changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. On disposal of an investment, the difference between net 
disposal proceeds and its fair value is recognised in profit or loss.
5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES
(a) Functional and presentation currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The financial statements 
are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing 
at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses 
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except that 
exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an 
adjustment to interest costs are classified as borrowing costs.
 Exchange differences are deferred in other comprehensive income when they are attributable to items that form 
part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
 Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates 
at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fair 
value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets 
and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of 
the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, are included in other comprehensive income.
(c) Group companies
 The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
•	 Assets	and	liabilities	for	each	statement	of	financial	position	presented	are	translated	at	the	closing	rates	at	
the date of that statement of financial position;
•	 Income	and	expenses	for	each	statement	of	comprehensive	income	are	translated	at	the	average	exchange	
rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing 
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rates on the dates of the 
transactions); and
•	 All	resulting	exchange	differences	are	recognised	as	a	separate	component	of	other	comprehensive	income.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
5 FOREIGN CURRENCIES (cont’d)
(c) Group companies
 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate at the date of the statement of financial position. 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
 On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign operations 
are recognised in other comprehensive income. On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of 
the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that 
includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign 
operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), 
all of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the separate component of equity are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss  
on disposal. In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary  
that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed 
to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, 
reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates or joint ventures that do not result in the Group 
losing significant influence or joint control) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange difference is 
reclassified to profit or loss.
6 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
 All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
except for freehold land and capital work-in-progress which are not depreciated. 
 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment initially recognised includes its purchase price and any cost 
that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management. Cost also includes borrowing costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s 
carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The 
carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.  All other repairs and maintenance costs are recognised as 
expenses in profit or loss during the financial year in which they are incurred.
 Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised  
as follows:
 Buildings, including hotel properties 2 to 10.0%
 Plant, machinery, equipment and vehicles 4 to 33.3%
 Office equipment, furniture and fittings and renovations 5 to 33.3%
 Depreciation on capital work-in-progress commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
 The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at 
the end of each reporting period. The effects of any revision of the residual values and useful lives are included in 
profit or loss for the financial year in which the changes arise.
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets.
 Gains or losses on disposals are determined by comparing the net disposal proceeds with the carrying amounts and 
are included in other operating income/other operating expenses in the profit or loss.

Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

7 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES
 Investment properties, comprising principally land and buildings, are held for long term rental yields or for capital 
appreciation or both, and are not occupied by the Group. 
 Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and borrowing costs if 
the investment property meets the definition of a qualifying asset. After initial recognition, investment property is 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment except for freehold land and capital  
work-in-progress which are not depreciated.
 Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life. Depreciation on assets under construction commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use.
 Leasehold land is amortised on a straight-line basis over the respective lease periods between 15 and 99 years. 
Depreciation on buildings is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to allocate the cost to their residual values over 
the expected useful lives. The annual depreciation rate for buildings is 2%.
 Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All 
other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, 
the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
 Investment property is derecognised either when it has been disposed of or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Gains or losses on 
disposals are determined by comparing net disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in profit  
or loss.
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets.
8 CONCESSION ASSETS 
 Items classified as concession assets comprise expressway development expenditure and port infrastructure.
(a) Expressway development expenditure
 Expressway Development Expenditure (“EDE”) comprises the costs of construction (inclusive of the cost of 
reconstruction, widening and rehabilitation) of the concession assets.  EDE is measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment. 
 Where the Group provides construction services in exchange for the concession assets, the revenue and profits 
relating to the construction services are recognised in accordance with accounting policy 9(a) on revenue and 
profit recognition for construction contracts.
 Upon completion of the construction works and commencement of road tolling operations, the EDE are 
amortised over the concession periods based on the following formula:
Cumulative traffic volume to-date X EDE
Projected total traffic volume for the entire concession period
 The projected total traffic volume for the entire concession period is determined by a traffic survey carried out 
by a firm of independent traffic consultants and Directors’ annual re-assessment of the projected total traffic 
volume.
 All interest and fees incurred during the period of construction are capitalised in the EDE which in turn are 
amortised in profit or loss in accordance with the formula above. Interest and fees incurred after the completion 
of construction are charged to profit or loss.
 Compensation received relating to variations in terms of concession agreements are recognised as deferred 
income and are credited to profit or loss over the expected lives of the related assets, on bases consistent with 
amortisation of the related assets.

8 CONCESSION ASSETS (cont’d)
(b) Port infrastructure
 The Group recognises concession assets arising from a service concession arrangement when it has a right to 
charge for usage of the concession infrastructures and facilities. Concession assets received as consideration 
for providing construction or upgrade services in a service concession arrangement are measured at fair value on 
initial recognition. Subsequent to initial recognition, the concession assets are measured at cost, which includes 
capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment. The estimated 
useful life of concession assets in a service concession arrangement is over the concession period extended to  
the Group. 
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets.
9 REVENUE RECOGNITION
 Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised by reference to each distinct performance obligation promised 
in the contract with the customer when or as the Group transfers control of the goods or services promised in a 
contract and the customer obtains control of the goods or services.
 Revenue from contracts with customers is measured at its transaction price, being the amount of consideration to 
which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, net 
of discounts. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct good or service promised in the contract. Depending 
on the terms of the contract, revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a 
point in time or over time.
 The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met:
- The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the 
Group performs.
- The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or 
enhanced.
- The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an 
enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
 If any of the above conditions are not met, the Group recognises revenue at the point in time when the performance 
obligation is satisfied.
(a) Construction contracts
 A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of an asset or a combination of 
assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and functions or their 
ultimate purpose or use. Hence, it is accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue from construction 
contracts is recognised over time as the Group is constructing on the customer’s land, the customer generally 
controls any work in progress arising from the Group’s performance and the part-constructed building as it is 
being constructed. In addition, the Group also has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed 
to date.
 When the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and contract costs 
associated with the construction contract are recognised as revenue and expenses respectively by reference to 
the stage of completion of the contract activity at the reporting date.  The stage of completion of a construction 
contract is determined based on the proportion that the contract costs incurred for work performed to-date bear 
to the estimated total costs for the contract. 
 When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only 
to the extent of contract costs incurred that is probable will be recoverable.

---- Page 263 ----
Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024
31
9 REVENUE RECOGNITION (cont’d)
 (a) Construction contracts (cont’d)
 A provision for onerous contract is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are  
less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract. 
 Contract revenue comprises the initial amount of revenue agreed in the contract and variations in the contract 
work and claims that can be measured reliably. A variation or a claim is only included in contract revenue when 
it is probable that the customer will approve the variation or negotiations have reached an advanced stage such 
that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim. Variation claim gives rise to a variable consideration 
which is estimated at either the expected value or most likely amount and included in revenue to the extent that 
it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed. No element of financing is deemed present as the 
payment schedule and credit terms of 30 to 90 days are consistent with the market practice.
 The customer pays according to the progress claim submitted to them based on the progress of the construction 
measured over time. If the construction services rendered by the Group exceed the payment, a contract asset is 
recognised. If the payments exceed the construction services rendered, a contract liability is recognised. Further 
details on the accounting policy of contract assets and contract liability are disclosed in accounting policy 12 on 
contract assets and contract liabilities.
(b) Revenue from property development 
 Contracts with customers may include multiple promises to the customers and therefore accounted for as 
separate performance obligations. In such cases, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance 
obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated 
based on expected cost plus margin. 
 The revenue from property development is measured based on the transaction prices net of expected  
liquidated ascertained damages (“LAD”) payment. LAD is determined based on the expected value method.
 The transaction price is adjusted for the effects of time value of money if the timing of payments provides the 
customer with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. For contracts 
with advance payment from customer at the beginning of the contract prior to the transfer of developed 
properties which will take more than one year to complete, a contract liability will be recognised when the 
advance payment is received. 
 For contracts with deferred payment scheme, the Group adjusts the promised consideration for the effects 
of the significant financing component using the discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing 
transaction between the Group and its customer at contract inception. The significant financing component 
is recognised as finance income in the statement of comprehensive income over the credit period using the 
effective interest rate applicable at the inception date.
 Revenue from property development is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to the 
customer and it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange 
for the asset that will be transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that 
apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is 
transferred over time if the Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group 
and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
 The promised property is specifically identified by its plot, lot and parcel number and its attributes (such as its 
size and location) in the attached layout plan of the sale and purchase agreements. The purchaser could enforce 
its rights to the promised property if the Group seeks to sell the unit to another purchaser. The contractual 
restriction on the Group’s ability to direct the promised property for another use is substantive and the promised 
property sold to the purchaser does not have an alternative use to the Group. The Group has the right to 
payment for performance completed to date, is entitled to continue to transfer to the customer the development 
units promised and has the rights to complete the construction of the properties and enforce its rights to  
full payment.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
9 REVENUE RECOGNITION (cont’d)
(b) Revenue from property development (cont’d)
 If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to 
the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at 
a point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset.
 The Group recognises revenue over time using the input method, which is based on the proportion that the 
property development costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs for the property development.
 The Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties, when the control of the 
properties has been transferred to the purchasers and it is probable that the Group will collect the consideration 
to which it will be entitled to in exchange for the properties sold.
 When the Group is not able to determine the probability that the Group will collect the consideration to which 
the Group will be entitled to in exchange of development properties, the Group will defer the recognition of 
revenue from sales of the development properties. Consideration received from the customer is recognised as a  
contract liability.
 When cumulative work done exceeds progress billings made, such balance represents unbilled revenue and 
is therefore, classified as contract assets. Similarly, where progress billings made exceed cumulative work 
done, such balance represents the obligation to deliver goods to customers and is classified as contract  
liabilities accordingly.
 Payments made by defaulted purchasers of development properties are forfeited and recognised as forfeiture 
income in the profit or loss when the terms and conditions in respect of the right of forfeiture as stipulated in the 
sale and purchase agreements signed with the purchasers are fulfilled.
(c) Sales of quarry and manufactured products and goods
 Sales are recognised based on the transaction prices specified in the contracts, which are at a point in time  
upon delivery of products and customer acceptance, net of sales and service tax (“SST”) or sales tax and 
discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. There is no element of financing present as the Group’s 
sales of goods are on credit terms ranging from 30 to 90 days, which is consistent with the market practice.
(d) Concession revenue 
 Concession revenue from the operation of toll roads is recognised over time for the usage of the expressways. 
Pursuant to the relevant Concession Agreements, the Government of Malaysia reserves the right to restructure 
or to restrict the imposition of unit toll rate increases, and in such event, the Government shall compensate for 
any reduction in toll revenue, subject to negotiation and other considerations that the Government may deem fit. 
Toll compensation is recognised in the profit or loss over the period in which the compensation relates to based 
on the arrangements as disclosed in Note 28 to the financial statements. 
 Revenue from port operations is recognised over time as and when the services are performed, net of taxes, 
discounts and rebates. Revenue is recognised up to the amount the Group has a right to invoice, upon the 
performance of the respective services requested by the customers. There is no element of financing present as 
the sales are on credit terms of 30 days.
(e) Telecommunication services 
 Customers’ subscription to the telecommunication services includes the provision of corporate internet leased 
line or wireless point-to-point internet services and devices such as routers and wireless solutions.
 The provision of devices is for the exclusive use of the Group’s telecommunication services and do not represent 
distinct services or goods. Therefore, the services and devices are accounted for as a single performance 
obligation satisfied over time. Revenue is recognised over the period the telecommunication services are 
rendered.

---- Page 265 ----
Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024
33
9 REVENUE RECOGNITION (cont’d)
(f) Club operations revenue 
 Revenue from clubhouse operations represents income derived from membership subscription fees and sales 
of services. Membership subscription fees are recognised over time upon performance of services.
 There is no element of financing as the sales are made with credit terms ranging from on demand to 30 days, 
which is consistent with the market practice.
(g) Interest income 
 Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
 Interest income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) is recognised as part of net 
gains or net losses on these financial instruments.
 Interest income on financial assets at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the statement 
of comprehensive income as part of other operating income.
 Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial 
asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets, 
the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss 
allowance).
(h) Management fees
 Fees from management services are recognised as revenue over time during the period in which the services 
are rendered. There is no element of financing as the sales are made with credit terms of 30 days, which is 
consistent with the market practice.
(i)  Dividend income 
 Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established.
 Dividend income is received from financial assets measured at FVTPL and at FVOCI.
 Dividend income from financial assets at FVTPL is recognised as part of net gains or net losses on these 
financial instruments. Dividend income from financial assets at FVOCI is recognised as other operating income 
in the statement of comprehensive income.
 Dividend that clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an investment is recognised in other 
comprehensive income if it relates to an investment in equity instruments measured at FVOCI.
(j) Lease income 
 Lease payments received under operating leases are recognised as lease income on a straight-line basis over 
the operating lease terms (see accounting policy 15 on leases).
 Lease payments received under finance leases are recognised as lease income over the term of the lease using 
the net investment method (see accounting policy 15 on leases).
10 BORROWINGS AND BORROWING COSTS
 Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the initial recognised amount and the redemption amount is 
recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
 Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been 
extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred 
or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
10 BORROWINGS AND BORROWING COSTS (cont’d)
 When borrowings measured at amortised cost are modified without this resulting in derecognition, any gain or loss, 
being the difference between the original contractual cash flows and the modified cash flows discounted at the 
original effective interest rate, shall be recognised immediately in profit or loss.
 Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
 General and specific borrowing costs, including exchange differences to the extent that they are regarded as an 
adjustment to interest costs, directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, 
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are 
added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
 Borrowing costs incurred on borrowings to finance the construction of concession assets, investment properties 
and property, plant and equipment during the period that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its 
intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Interest relating to property development activities and 
construction contracts are accounted for in a similar manner.
 Properties under development which have been sold (where control of the property is transferred over time) should 
be excluded as qualifying assets for the purposes of borrowing cost capitalisation. All borrowing costs incurred  
were expensed to profit or loss when incurred when these properties were ready for their intended sale.
 All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
 When the basis to determine the future contractual cash flows of the borrowings are modified entirely as a result 
of Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) reform, the Group applies the reliefs provided by the Phase 2 amendments 
related to IBOR reform to adjust the effective interest rate of the borrowings with no modification gain or loss being 
recognised.
 In situations where some or all of a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the borrowings 
does not meet the criteria of the Phase 2 amendments, the Group first applies the practical expedient to the changes 
required by IBOR reform, including updating the effective interest rate of the borrowings. Any additional changes 
are accounted for as modification of borrowings in accordance with the requirement in MFRS 9 (that is, assessed 
for modification or derecognition, with the resulting modification gain/loss recognised immediately in profit or loss 
where the borrowings are not derecognised).
11 INVENTORIES
(a) Land held for property development
 Land held for property development consists of land held for future development where no significant 
development work has been undertaken or where development activities are not expected to be completed 
within the normal operating cycle. Such land is classified as inventory under non-current asset and is stated at 
the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
 Costs associated with the acquisition of land includes the purchase price of the land, professional fees, stamp 
duties, commissions, conversion fees and other relevant levies. 
 Land held for property development is transferred to property development costs (under current assets) when 
development activities, including activities associated with obtaining approvals prior to commencement of 
physical development, have commenced and the development is expected to be completed within the normal 
operating cycle.

11 INVENTORIES (cont’d)
(b) Property development costs
 Property development costs comprise costs associated with the acquisition of land and all costs directly 
attributable to development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to these activities, such 
as direct building costs, and other related development expenditure, including interest expenses incurred 
during the period of active development. In addition, the property development costs include allocated costs of 
constructing public infrastructure (i.e. common costs). The common costs which are allocated to development 
projects and will be incurred after the development activities would be accrued. These costs would be allocated 
as costs incurred that are attributable to the development as the development activities progress. When the 
public infrastructure is subsequently constructed, the actual costs would be off-set against the accrued costs.
 Property development costs not recognised as an expense are recognised as an asset and are stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value.
(c) Completed buildings, vacant industrial and bungalow lots
 Units of completed development properties, vacant industrial and bungalow lots held for sale are stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost comprises proportionate cost of land and related development 
and construction expenditure.
(d) Other inventories
 Other inventories comprise construction and raw materials; quarry and manufactured products; and consumables.
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average 
basis. The costs of raw materials and consumables comprise the original cost of purchase plus the cost of 
bringing the inventories to their present location and for finished goods and quarry products, these consist of 
direct materials, direct labour, direct charges and production overheads.
 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and 
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
12 CONTRACT ASSETS AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES
 Contract asset is the right to consideration for goods or services transferred to the customers. In the case of property 
development and construction contracts, contract asset is the excess of cumulative revenue earned over cumulative 
billings to-date. The balance is classified as contract assets under current assets in the statement of financial 
position.
 Details on the Company’s impairment policies of contract assets are provided in the accounting policy 22(D) on 
impairment of financial assets.
 Contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to customers for which the Group has received the 
consideration or has billed the customers. The balance is classified as contract liabilities under current liabilities in 
the statement of financial position.
13 CONTRACT COST ASSETS 
 The Group has recognised an asset in respect of sales commissions and legal fees on sales and purchase agreements 
incurred to secure property development sale contracts. These costs are incremental costs that would not have been 
incurred by the Group if the respective sale contracts had not been obtained. The Group expects to recover these 
costs in the future through property development revenue earned from the customers. Accordingly, the contract cost 
asset is amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the specific contract to which the costs relate to, ranging 
from a period of 2 to 3 years.
 The Group has elected the practical expedient to recognise the incremental costs in relation to the contracts with an 
amortisation period of less than one year as an expense when incurred.
 An impairment is recognised in profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost asset 
recognised exceeds the remaining amount of consideration that the Group expects to receive for the specific 
contract that the costs relate to (after deducting additional costs required to be incurred in relation to the contracts).

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
14 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
(a) Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary 
course of business and include retention monies withheld by principals. Other receivables generally arise from 
transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group. If collection is expected in one year or less (or 
in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets.  If not, they are 
presented as non-current assets.
 Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they 
contain significant financing components, where they are recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.  
Other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs. 
 After recognition, trade and other receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less loss allowance (see accounting policy 22(D) on impairment of financial assets).
(b) Loans to subsidiaries are recognised initially at fair value. If there is any difference between cash disbursed and 
fair value on initial recognition, the difference would be accounted as additional investment in the subsidiary as 
it reflects the substance of the transaction.
 Loans to subsidiaries are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss 
allowance. Details on the Company’s impairment policies of loans to subsidiaries are provided in the accounting 
policy 22(D) on impairment of financial assets.
15 LEASES
(a) Accounting by lessee
 Leases are recognised as right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the 
leased asset is available for use by the Group.
 Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the 
contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases 
of properties for which the Group is a lessee, it has elected the practical expedient provided in MFRS 16 not to 
separate lease and non-lease components. Both components are accounted for as a single lease component 
and payments for both components are included in the measurement of lease liability.
 Lease term
 In determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive 
to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options are only included in 
the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended.
 The Group reassesses the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances 
that is within the control of the Group and affects whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option 
not previously included in the determination of lease term, or not to exercise an option previously included in the 
determination of lease term. A revision in lease term results in remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
 ROU assets
 ROU assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:
•	 The	amount	of	the	initial	measurement	of	lease	liability;
•	 Any	lease	payments	made	at	or	before	the	commencement	date	less	any	lease	incentive	received;
•	 Any	initial	direct	costs;	and
•	 Decommissioning	or	restoration	costs.
 ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. 
The ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a 
straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the ROU asset is depreciated 
over the underlying asset’s useful life. In addition, the ROU assets are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the 
lease liabilities.

15 LEASES (cont’d)
(a) Accounting by lessee (cont’d)
 ROU assets (cont’d)
 The Group presents ROU assets that meet the definition of investment property in the statement of financial 
position as investment property. ROU assets that are not investment properties are presented as a separate line 
item in the statement of financial position.
 At the end of the reporting period, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an 
indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is assessed and written down immediately to its 
recoverable amount. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets.
 Lease liabilities
 Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the 
commencement date. The lease payments include the following:
•	 Fixed	payments,	less	any	lease	incentive	receivable;
•	 Variable	lease	payments	that	are	based	on	an	index	or	a	rate,	initially	measured	using	the	index	or	rate	as	at	
the commencement date;
•	 Amounts	expected	to	be	payable	by	the	Group	under	residual	value	guarantees;
•	 The	exercise	price	of	a	purchase	and	extension	option	if	the	group	is	reasonably	certain	to	exercise	that	
option; and
•	 Payments	of	penalties	for	terminating	the	lease,	if	the	lease	term	reflects	the	Group	exercising	that	option.
 Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily 
determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. 
This is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of 
similar value to the ROU asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.
 Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss 
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability 
for each period.
 The Group presents the lease liabilities as a separate line item in the statement of financial position. Interest 
expense on the lease liability is presented within the finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income.
 Reassessment of lease liabilities
 The Group is also exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend on an index 
or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments 
based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is remeasured and adjusted against the ROU assets.
 A change in lease payments (including rent concessions, except for COVID-19 related rent concessions), other 
than those arising from a change in amounts expected to be payables under residual value guarantees or in an 
index or rate used to determine lease payments, is accounted for as a lease modification if it is not part of the 
original terms and conditions of the lease. The lease modification is accounted for as either a new lease or as a 
remeasurement of an existing lease liability, depending on the criteria set in MFRS 16 “Leases”.
 Short term leases and leases of low value assets
 Short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low value assets comprise small IT 
equipment and office furniture. Payments associated with short term leases of assets and all leases of low value 
assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
15 LEASES (cont’d)
(b) Accounting by lessor
 As a lessor, the Group determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. 
To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of 
the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee. As part of this assessment, 
the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of  
the asset.
 Finance leases
 The Group classifies a lease as a finance lease if the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.
 The Group derecognises the underlying asset and recognises a receivable at an amount equal to the net 
investment in a finance lease. Net investment in a finance lease is measured at an amount equal to the sum 
of the present value of lease payments from the lessee and the unguaranteed residual value of the underlying 
asset. Initial direct costs are also included in the initial measurement of the net investment. The net investment 
is subject to MFRS 9 impairment. See accounting policy 22(D) on impairment of financial assets. In addition, the 
Group reviews regularly the estimated unguaranteed residual value.
 Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method so as to reflect a 
constant periodic rate of return. The Group revises the lease income allocation if there is a reduction in the 
estimated unguaranteed residual value. 
 Operating leases
 The Group classifies a lease as an operating lease if the lease does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee.
 The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as lease income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
 When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the statement of financial position 
based on the nature of the asset. Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating lease are added to the 
carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same basis 
as lease income.
 Sublease classification 
 When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it assesses the lease classification of a sublease with reference to 
the ROU asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is short-
term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sublease as an  
operating lease.

16 QUARRY DEVELOPMENT
 Expenses incurred on the development of quarry faces are capitalised and amortised based on actual production 
volume over the estimated reserves available from the quarry faces developed, which is based on the higher of the 
existing or new quarry development phases. 
 The overburden removal costs in the development of a quarry face is recognised as deferred expenditure if all the 
following conditions are met:
•	 It	is	probable	that	the	future	economic	benefit	(improved	access	to	the	quarry	face)	associated	with	the	overburden	
removal activity will flow to the entity;
•	 The	entity	can	identify	the	component	of	the	quarry	face	for	which	access	has	been	improved;	and	
•	 The	costs	relating	to	the	overburden	removal	activity	associated	with	that	component	can	be	measured	reliably.
 Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is assessed and written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount. See accounting policy 25 on impairment of non-financial assets.
17 NON-CURRENT ASSETS (OR DISPOSAL GROUP) HELD FOR SALE
 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. 
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred 
tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair 
value which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
 An impairment is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value 
less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset 
(or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment previously recognised. A gain or loss not 
previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date 
of derecognition. 
 Non-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they 
are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified 
as held for sale continue to be recognised.
 Non-current assets classified as held for sale and assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented 
separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as 
held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the statement of financial position.
 A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of and that represents a separate 
major line of business, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business. The results of 
discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of comprehensive income.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
18 INCOME TAXES
 The income tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. The income tax expense or credit 
for the period is the tax payable on the current period’s taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate 
for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences 
and to unused tax losses. Tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised 
in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
 The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end 
of the reporting period in the countries where the Group, joint ventures and associates operate and generate taxable 
income.
 Current tax expense is determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group operates and 
includes all taxes based upon the taxable profits. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which the applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions 
where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. This liability is measured using 
the single best estimate of the most likely outcome.
 Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts 
attributed to assets and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, 
deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is also 
not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
 Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax 
liability is settled.
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which 
the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised. 
 Deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except when it arises from a transaction which is recognised directly in 
equity, in which case the deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity, or when it arises from a business 
combination that is an acquisition, in which case the deferred tax is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.
 Deferred and income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis.
19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
(a) Short term employee benefits
 Wages, salaries, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services 
are rendered by employees of the Group.
 The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration 
the profit attributable to the owners of the Company after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a  
provision where there is a contractual obligation or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive 
obligation.

---- Page 273 ----
Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

19 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (cont’d)
(b) Post-employment benefits
 The Group has various post-employment benefit schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in 
the countries in which it operates. These benefit plans are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. 
 A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity (a fund) on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and the Group has no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits 
relating to employee services in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that 
defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependant on one or 
more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
(i) Defined contribution plan
 The Group’s contributions to a defined contribution plan are recognised in profit or loss in the period to 
which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further financial obligations. 
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the 
future payments is available. As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the national 
pension scheme, the Employees Provident Fund (“EPF”), which is a defined contribution plan.
(ii) Defined benefit plan
 The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of a defined benefit plan is the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets.
 The defined benefit obligation, calculated using the projected unit credit method, is determined by 
independent actuaries, by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the end 
of the reporting period on government bonds which have tenure and terms to maturity approximating the 
terms of the related liability.
 Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. The actuarial gains and 
losses are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
 The current service cost of the defined benefit plan reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation 
resulting from the employee service in the current financial year. It is recognised in the profit or loss in 
employee benefit expense, except where it is included in the cost of an asset.
 The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement 
of comprehensive income.
 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from plan amendments or  
curtailments are recognised immediately in profit or loss as past service costs.
20 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
 For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short-term 
cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, 
deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant 
risk of changes in value, less bank overdrafts.
 Bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are 
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. In the statement of financial 
position, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

21 SHARE CAPITAL
(i) Classification
 Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
(ii) Share issue costs
 Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are deducted against equity.
(iii) Dividends
 Liability is recognised for the amount of any dividends declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer 
at the discretion of the Group, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of  
the reporting period. 
 Distributions to holders of an equity instrument are recognised directly in equity.
(iv) Purchase of own shares
 Where the Company purchases its equity share capital as a result of a share buy-back, the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs, net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the 
owners of the Company as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. 
 Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, the cost of treasury shares is reversed from the treasury 
share account and the realised gain or loss on disposal or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental 
transaction costs, is recognised in the capital reserve account.
 Where such shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of treasury shares is deducted against the retained 
profits of the Company.
(v) Perpetual Sukuk
 Perpetual Sukuk is classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial 
assets to another person or entity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of the instrument are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
 Perpetual Sukuk holders’ entitlement is accounted for as an appropriation in equity and the distribution is 
recognised in the period in which it is declared.
22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another enterprise. 
 A financial asset is any asset that is cash, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another 
enterprise, a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are 
potentially favourable, or an equity instrument of another enterprise.
 A financial liability is any liability that is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another 
enterprise, or to exchange financial instruments with another enterprise under conditions that are potentially 
unfavourable.
 Financial Assets
(A) Classification
 The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: 
•	 those	to	be	measured	subsequently	at	fair	value	(either	through	other	comprehensive	income	(‘OCI’)	or	
through profit or loss), and
•	 those	to	be	measured	at	amortised	cost.

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont’d)
 Financial Assets (cont’d)
(B) Recognition and derecognition 
 Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership.
(C) Measurement
 At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.
 Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash 
flows are solely payment of principal and interest (“SPPI”).
 Debt Instruments
 Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset 
and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Group reclassifies debt instruments when and only when its 
business model for managing those assets changes. There are three measurement categories to classify its debt 
instruments:
(i) Amortised cost
 Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely 
payment of principal and interest (“SPPI”) are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in other operating income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or 
loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss together with foreign exchange gains and 
losses. Impairment is presented as a separate line item in the statement of comprehensive income.
(ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income (‘FVOCI’)
 Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the 
assets’ cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken 
through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange gains and 
losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain 
or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in other operating income using the effective interest rate method. Impairment is 
presented as a separate line item in the statement of comprehensive income.
(iii) Fair value through profit or loss (‘FVTPL’)
 Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. The Group may also 
irrevocably designate financial assets at FVTPL if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates a mismatch 
created by assets and liabilities being measured on different basis. Fair value changes are presented net 
and recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.
Equity instruments 
 The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has 
elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification 
of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investments. Dividends from 
such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other operating income when the Group’s right 
to receive payments is established. 
 Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss.

 Financial Assets (cont’d)
(D) Subsequent measurement - impairment 
(a) Impairment for debt instruments and financial guarantee contracts
 The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (‘ECL’) associated with its debt 
instruments carried at amortised cost and financial guarantee contracts issued. The impairment methodology 
applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
 The following financial instruments of the Group are subject to the ECL model:
•	 Trade	receivables
•	 Other	receivables
•	 Amounts	due	from	related	companies	(including	loans	to	subsidiaries	(applicable	in	Company’s	separate	
financial statements), amounts owing by joint ventures and associates)
•	 Contract	assets
•	 Financial	guarantee	contracts	
•	 Redeemable	Convertible	Unsecured	Loan	Stocks	(“RCULS”)
•	 Redeemable	Unsecured	Murabahah	Stocks	(“RUMS”)
•	 RCSIDS	Deferred	Payment
 While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified 
impairment was immaterial.
 ECL represent a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between present value of cash flows 
according to contract and present value of cash flows the Group expects to receive, over the remaining 
life of the financial instrument. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the 
expected payments to reimburse the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the 
Group expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.
 The measurement of ECL reflects:
•	 an	unbiased	and	probability-weighted	amount	that	is	determined	by	evaluating	a	range	of	possible	
outcomes;
•	 the	time	value	of	money;	and	
•	 reasonable	and	supportable	information	that	is	available	without	undue	cost	or	effort	at	the	reporting	date	
about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

 At each reporting date, the Group measures ECL through loss allowance at an amount equal to  
12 months ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not 
increased significantly since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, a loss allowance at  
an amount equal to lifetime ECL is required.
(ii) Simplified approach for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables 
 The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure ECL which uses a lifetime ECL for all 
trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.

(b) Significant increase in credit risk
 The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether 
there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset 
as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available 
reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.
 The following indicators are incorporated: 
•	 internal	credit	rating	
•	 external	credit	rating	(as	far	as	available)
•	 actual	or	expected	significant	adverse	changes	in	business,	financial	or	economic	conditions	that	are	
expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations
•	 actual	or	expected	significant	changes	in	the	operating	results	of	the	debtor
•	 significant	increases	in	credit	risk	on	other	financial	instruments	of	the	same	debtor
•	 significant	changes	in	the	value	of	the	collateral	supporting	the	obligation	or	in	the	quality	of	third-party	
guarantees or credit enhancements
•	 significant	changes	in	the	expected	performance	and	behaviour	of	the	debtor,	including	changes	in	the	
payment status of debtor in the group and changes in the operating results of the debtor
 Macroeconomic information (such as market interest rates or growth rates) is incorporated as part of the 
internal rating model. 
 Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 
days past due in making a contractual payment.
(c) Definition of default and credit-impaired financial assets
 The Group defines a financial instrument as default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-
impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:
(i) Quantitative criteria:
 The Group defines a financial instrument as default, when the counterparty fails to make contractual 
payment within 90 days of when they fall due.
(ii) Qualitative criteria: 
 The debtor meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the debtor is in significant financial 
difficulty. The Group considers the following instances:
•	 the	debtor	is	in	breach	of	financial	covenants
•	 concessions	have	been	made	by	the	lender	relating	to	the	debtor’s	financial	difficulty
•	 it	is	becoming	probable	that	the	debtor	will	enter	bankruptcy	or	other	financial	reorganisation
•	 the	debtor	is	insolvent
Financial instruments that are credit-impaired are assessed on an individual basis.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont’d)
 Financial Assets (cont’d)
(D) Subsequent measurement - impairment (cont’d)
(d) Groupings of instruments for ECL measured on collective basis
(i) Collective assessment 
 To measure ECL, trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables have been grouped based 
on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The contract assets relate to unbilled 
work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the 
same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade 
receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.
(ii) Individual assessment
 Trade receivables and contract assets which are in default or credit-impaired are assessed individually.
 Other receivables, amounts due from related companies, financial guarantee contracts, RCULS, RUMS 
and RCSIDS Deferred Payment are assessed on an individual basis for ECL measurement.
 Loans to subsidiaries in the Company’s separate financial statements are assessed on an individual 
basis for ECL measurement, as credit risk information is obtained and monitored based on each loan to 
subsidiary.
(E) Write-off
(i) Trade receivables and contract assets
 Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. 
Indicators that there are no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a 
debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group and significant delays in collection periods.
 Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets are presented as net impairment and disclosed as a 
separate line item in the statement of comprehensive income. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against the same line item.
(ii) Other receivables, amounts due from related companies, financial guarantee contracts, RCULS and RUMS
 The Group writes off financial assets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts 
and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The assessment of no reasonable 
expectation of recovery is based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or assets to generate 
sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount. The Group may write off financial assets that are still 
subject to enforcement activity. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off will result in a write 
back of impairment.
 Derivative Financial Instruments
 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial 
instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss. 

---- Page 279 ----
Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (cont’d)
 Fair Value Estimation 
 The fair value of publicly traded derivatives and securities is based on quoted market prices at the end of the 
reporting period.
 The fair values of cross currency swap and interest rate swap contracts are calculated as the present value of the 
estimated future cash flows. 
 In assessing the fair value of non-traded derivatives and financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods 
and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date. Quoted market prices 
or dealer quotes for the specific or similar instruments are used for long term debt. Other techniques and bases, such 
as discounted value of future cash flows and the underlying net asset base of the instrument, are used to determine 
fair value for the remaining financial instruments. In particular, the fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by 
discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar 
financial instruments.
 The carrying values of the financial assets and the financial liabilities with a maturity period of less than one year are 
assumed to approximate their fair values.
 Offsetting Financial Instruments
 Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, 
or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on 
future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency  
or bankruptcy.
 Financial Liabilities
(A) Classification
 The Group classifies its financial liabilities as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other 
financial liabilities at amortised cost. The classification depends on the nature of the liabilities and the purpose 
for which the financial liabilities were incurred. Management determines the classification at initial recognition.
(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 The Group classifies financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss if they are held for trading. They 
are presented as current liabilities if they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the 
reporting period; otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities. Derivatives are also categorised as 
held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
(ii) Other financial liabilities at amortised cost
 Other financial liabilities of the Group comprise ‘bonds’, ‘term loans’, ‘government support loans’, ‘trade 
and other payables’ (other than retirement benefits payable and GST payables) and ‘borrowings’ in the 
statement of financial position.
(B) Recognition, initial measurement and subsequent measurement
 When other financial liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value plus directly attributable 
transaction costs.
 Subsequent to initial recognition, other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the other 
financial liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.
(C) Derecognition
 Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or 
expired.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
23 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES
 Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods or services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial 
year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, or in the normal 
operating cycle of the business if longer. Otherwise, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
 Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
24 GOVERNMENT GRANTS
 Grants from the government are recognised at their fair values where there is a reasonable assurance that the grants 
will be received and the Group will comply with all attached conditions.
 Government grants relating to the acquisition of assets and operational maintenance of the concession assets are 
classified as non-current liabilities and are credited to profit or loss over the expected lives of the related assets, on 
bases consistent with the depreciation of the related assets.
 The Group also treats the benefit of a government loan at below market rate of interest as a government grant.  
In accordance with the transitional provision of the amendments to MFRS 120 “Accounting for Government Grants 
and Disclosure of Government Assistance”, loans received on or after 1 April 2010 are recognised and measured 
initially at their fair value. The benefit of the government loan at below market rate of interest is measured as the 
difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received, and is recognised as a government 
grant, which will be credited to profit or loss over the expected lives of the related assets on bases consistent with 
the depreciation of the related assets for which the loan was granted to the Group.
 Government support loans obtained prior to 1 April 2010 are recognised and measured initially based on proceeds 
received, and hence do not give rise to a government grant.
25 IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
 Assets (including goodwill or intangible assets not ready for use) that have an indefinite useful life are not subject 
to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. The Group also assesses goodwill, intangible assets with 
indefinite useful life and other non-financial assets that are subject to amortisation for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognised for 
the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets 
are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent 
of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than 
goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 
The impairment is charged to profit or loss. Impairment of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, any 
subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in profit or loss.
26 PROVISIONS
 Provisions are recognised when:
•	the	Group	has	a	present	legal	or	constructive	obligation	as	a	result	of	past	events;
•	it	is	probable	that	an	outflow	of	resources	will	be	required	to	settle	the	obligation;	and
•	a	reliable	estimate	of	the	amount	can	be	made.
 Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as 
a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are not recognised for future 
operating losses.
 Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure expected to be 
required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the obligation.  The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as 
finance cost.

27 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
 Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker (“CODM”). The Operating Committee (“OpCo”), which is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the CODM.
 Segment revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are those amounts resulting from the operating activities of a 
segment that are directly attributable to the segment and the relevant portion that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis to the segment.
 Segment revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are determined before intragroup balances and intragroup 
transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
28 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 The Group does not recognise contingent liabilities other than those arising from business combinations, but 
discloses their existence in the financial statements.  A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from 
past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare 
circumstance where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. Contingent 
liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts.
 In the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group under a business combination, the contingent liabilities assumed are 
measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
 The Group recognises separately the contingent liabilities of the acquirees as part of allocating the cost of a business 
combination where their fair values can be measured reliably. Where the fair values cannot be measured reliably, the 
resulting effect will be reflected in the goodwill arising from the acquisitions and the information about the contingent 
liabilities acquired will be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
 Subsequent to the initial recognition, the Group measures the contingent liabilities that are recognised separately 
at the date of acquisition at the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the provisions 
of MFRS 137 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” and the amount initially recognised  
less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers”.
29 FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS
 Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group or the Company to make specified payments to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance 
with the terms of the debt instrument.
 Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is 
initially measured at fair value.
 The fair value of a financial guarantee is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between 
the contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, 
or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.
 Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance 
with the expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and the amount initially recognised less 
cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers”, where appropriate.

For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
1 GENERAL INFORMATION
 The Company is principally engaged in construction and investment holding activities. The Group’s principal  
activities consist of construction, property development, manufacturing and quarrying, tollway operations, port 
operations and investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries and associates are described in  
Note 52 to the financial statements.
 The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and listed on the  
Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Malaysia”).
 The address of the registered office of the Company is 2nd Floor, Wisma IJM, Jalan Yong Shook Lin,  
46050 Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.
 The financial statements have been approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors  
on 5 July 2024.
2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
 Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and 
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are 
outlined below.
(a) Deferred tax assets
 Deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial 
performance of the particular entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
(b) Construction contracts 
 Revenue is recognised when or as the control of the asset is transferred to the customers and, depending on 
the terms of the contract and the applicable laws governing the contract, control of the asset may transfer over 
time or at a point in time.  If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the 
contract by reference to the progress, based on the stage of completion method. The stage of completion of a 
construction contract is determined based on the proportion that the contract costs incurred for work performed 
to-date bear to the estimated total costs for the contract.
 The Group has estimated total contract revenue based on the initial amount of revenue agreed in the contract 
and variations in the contract work and claims that can be measured reliably based on the latest available 
information, and in the absence of such, the Directors’ best estimates derived from reasonable assumptions, 
experience and judgement. Where the actual approved variations and claims differ from the estimates, such 
difference will impact the contract profits/(losses) recognised. Variable consideration for construction contracts 
in the form of variation orders and contractual claims submitted to project employers are only included in the 
transaction price of a construction contract based on the following factors:
-  Status of negotiations with project employers;
- Construction work performed by the Group are identifiable, measurable and considered reasonable in relation 
to the work scope for the variable consideration claimed by the Group;
- Any evidences providing a legal, objective and verifiable basis for the Group to claim for variable consideration, 
which includes independent third-party advice; and
-  The Group’s historical experience in successfully obtaining approval from project employers for the variation 
work claims submitted by the Group.

Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (cont’d)
(b) Construction contracts (cont’d)
 The final construction contract transaction price may include assessments of the recovery of variation orders 
and claims yet to be agreed with the project employer due to timing and requirements of the normal contractual 
processes. Therefore, the construction revenue recognised by the Group is constrained to the amounts of variable 
consideration where the Group believes it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Significant 
judgement and estimates are also involved in assessing whether liquidated ascertained damages (“LAD”) should 
be included as variable consideration in determining the transaction price for construction revenue recognition. 
LAD is determined based on the contractual terms of the signed contracts with the project employer and the 
likelihood of approval of extension of time by project employers, where the Group’s construction revenue is 
constrained to reflect the expected amount of LAD to be included as variable consideration. 
 Total contract costs are determined based on approved construction budgets. These budgets are supported 
by sub-contractors’ quotations, actual contracts awarded and variation work orders awarded to main and sub-
contractors. Significant judgement is required in the estimation of total contract costs, where the total contract 
costs may include estimated cost contingencies to address specific risks for certain construction contracts. 
These costs contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the duration of the construction contract 
and are adjusted where appropriate. In addition, significant estimates are required for costs to complete when 
the certification process of contract costs are not finalised with subcontractors, prior to the financial year 
end. The significant judgement and estimates involved in the estimation of total contract costs and costs to 
complete affect the stage of completion referred to in determining the construction revenue. Where the actual 
total contract costs are different from the estimated total contract costs, such difference will impact the contract 
profits/(losses) recognised. The Management has assessed that a 1% increase to the total estimated contract 
costs for ongoing construction projects would result in a decrease in construction revenue of RM48.2 million 
during the financial year.
(c) Property development 
 Revenue is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to customers and it is probable 
that the Group will receive the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that will be 
transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the applicable laws governing the 
contract, control of the asset may transfer over time or at a point in time. 
 If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to 
the stage of completion of the development activity at the end of the reporting period. The stage of completion is 
determined based on the proportion that the property development costs incurred to-date bear to the estimated 
total costs for the property development. Where it is probable that total property development costs of a 
development phase will exceed total property development revenue of the development phase, the expected 
loss on the development phase is recognised as an expense immediately. Total property development costs 
are determined based on approved budgets. These budgets are supported by the main contractors’ quotations, 
actual contracts awarded and variation work orders awarded to the main contractors.
 Significant judgement is required in determining the completeness and accuracy of the total property 
development costs as estimates of future property development costs are inherently uncertain, which involve 
management’s estimation of future cost to completion of the development. Due to the scale of the projects 
and the length of the property development cycle, there are inherent estimation uncertainties in deriving the 
remaining costs to complete such as uncertainties in the estimated costs of work packages yet to be procured by 
the Group from contractors, macroeconomic factors that may result in potential escalation of prices for building 
materials and unforeseen circumstances such as impact of climate change on the future building requirements 
of new properties. The estimation of the future costs to completion would evolve over the life of the property 
development projects and accordingly, the total property development costs used for the measurement of stage 
of completion of the revenue recognition would be subject to changes. In addition, significant estimates are 
required to derive the costs to complete when the certification process of the actual property development costs 
incurred are not finalised with contractors, prior to the financial year end.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (cont’d)
(c) Property development (cont’d)
 Substantial changes in cost estimates in future periods may affect the profitability of the respective property 
development projects. Where the actual total property development costs are different from the estimated total 
property development costs, such differences will impact the property development profits/(losses) recognised.
(d) Amortisation of expressway development expenditure
 The expressway development expenditure of the Group are amortised over the concession period based on  
the following formula:
 Cumulative traffic volume to-date X  Expressway development expenditure
 Projected total traffic volume for the entire concession period
 In order to determine the projected total traffic volume for the entire concession period, the Group relies on the 
traffic survey carried out by a firm of independent traffic consultants and Directors’ annual re-assessment of the 
current and future years’ projected total traffic volume.  Any changes in the projected total traffic volume for the 
entire concession period will impact the amortisation charge for the year.
(e) Useful life of port concession assets
 Management had assessed and determined that the useful lives of the port concession assets would be 60 
years as management has the intention and ability to fulfil the obligations in order to be granted an extension of 
the concession as provided for in the Privatisation Agreement effective from 1 June 2015. The determination of 
useful lives for port concession assets is further described in Note 28 on concession assets.
(f) Impairment of non-financial assets
 The Group determines whether an asset is impaired by evaluating the extent to which the recoverable amount of 
an asset is less than its cost. This evaluation is subject to, amongst others, changes such as market performance, 
economic and political situation of the country. A variety of methods are used to determine the recoverable 
amount, such as valuation reports and discounted cash flows. For discounted cash flows, significant judgement 
is required in the estimation of the present value of future cash flows generated by the assets, which involve 
uncertainties and are significantly affected by assumptions used and judgements made regarding estimates 
of future cash flows and discount rates. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the results of the 
Group’s assessment for impairment of assets.
(g) Measurement of ECL allowance
 The measurement of expected credit loss (“ECL”) allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is 
an area that requires the use of significant assumptions about the future economic conditions (such as growth 
rates, employment rates and inflation rates) and credit behaviour of the customers. Explanation of the inputs, 
assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is detailed in Note 3(b). Areas of significant 
judgements involved in the measurement of ECL are detailed as follows:
•	 Determining	the	number	and	relative	weightings	of	forward-looking	scenarios	
 The Group measures loss allowance on the probability-weighted amount that reflects the possibility of credit 
loss occurring. This requires forecast of economic variables (such as growth rates, employment rates or 
inflation rates) and their associated impact on PD (‘probability of default’), LGD (‘loss given default’) and EAD 
(‘exposure at default’) which are provided in possible scenarios along with scenario weightings. Probability-
weighted ECLs are determined by running each scenario through the relevant ECL model and multiplying 
it by the appropriate scenario weighting. As with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihood of 
occurrences are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be 
significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimates 
of the possible outcomes and are appropriately representative of the range of possible scenarios. These 
possible outcomes are used in determining ECL allowance for financial assets, such as RUMS in associates 
and RCULS in joint ventures. The details on the ECL assessments are disclosed in Notes 30, 31 and 36 to the 
financial statements.

2 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (cont’d)
(h) Net realisable value of property development costs and completed units
 The Group writes down the inventories of property development cost and completed units to their net realisable 
values based on:
(i) the estimated selling prices by reference to recent signed sales and purchase agreements, net of discounts 
for completed units, or quotations from potential buyers; or
(ii)  recent transacted prices of comparable properties in similar or nearby locations for completed units, net of 
discounts, and for inventories of property development costs, the estimated costs necessary to complete 
the property have been considered. In determining the estimated transaction prices, discounts and costs 
to complete the property, the Group considered the current economic outlook, future property market 
conditions and adjustment factors such as the size and demand (ceiling price) of the particular properties in 
determining their net realisable values; or
(iii) valuation reports prepared by independent valuers. In determining the fair value of inventories, significant 
judgement and estimates have been used by the valuers in determining adjustment to be applied which 
involved considerations on condition, age, and size of the properties. Any changes in the estimates and 
assumptions used could have a significant impact on the fair value of the inventories.
 As disclosed in Note 35 to the financial statements, valuation reports prepared by independent valuers were 
used in determining the recoverable amounts of inventories. The key assumption used was market value per 
square foot of the comparable properties in the vicinity of the said area. An increase or decrease of 5% for 
market value per square foot will lead to decrease/increase of write down of inventories by RM9.1 million during 
the financial year.
(i) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries
 The Company determines whether an investment in a subsidiary is impaired by evaluating the extent to which 
the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its cost. Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the 
fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use for the asset.
 As there are no readily available market prices for the investments in subsidiaries and in the circumstance that 
the subsidiaries are not expected to generate positive cash flows in the future, the fair values less cost to sell are 
determined by measuring the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities recognised in the statement of the 
financial position of the subsidiaries at the reporting date, less any costs to sell. The Directors determined the 
recoverability of the investments in subsidiaries based on the subsidiaries’ net liquid assets available to repay 
the Company as the shareholder.
 For value-in-use, significant judgement is required in the estimation of the present value of future cash flows 
generated by the subsidiaries, which involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by assumptions used and 
judgements made regarding estimates of future cash flows and discount rates. Changes in assumptions could 
significantly affect the results of the Company’s assessment for impairment of the investments in subsidiaries. 
The details on the impairment of investment in subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 29 to the financial statement.
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
 The Group’s activities expose it to market (including foreign currency exchange and interest rates), credit and liquidity 
risks. The Group’s overall financial risk management objective is to minimise any potential adverse effects from the 
unpredictability of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance in order to ensure the Group creates 
value for its shareholders. Financial risk management is carried out through risk reviews, internal control systems, 
insurance programmes and adherence to the Group’s financial risk management policies. The management regularly 
reviews these risks and approves the treasury policies, which cover the management of these risks.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont’d)
 The Group used derivative financial instruments such as cross currency swap contracts to hedge certain financial 
risk exposures.
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
 Currency risks arise on account of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency that is 
not the functional currency of the entity. 
 Entities within the Group primarily transact in their respective functional currencies except for certain 
transactions and borrowings which were denominated in currencies other than their respective functional 
currencies.
  Foreign exchange exposures in transactional currencies other than functional currencies of the operating 
entities are managed by entering into cross currency swap contracts and the borrowing amounts are kept 
to an acceptable level.
 The currency exposure profile of the Group’s and the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities is 
disclosed in the respective notes to the financial statements.
 As at the reporting date, the Group’s and Company’s Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”) functional currency entities 
had United States Dollar (“USD”) denominated net monetary liabilities. The effects to the Group’s and 
the Company’s profit after tax if the USD had strengthened/weakened by 3% (2023: 5%) against RM are  
as follows:
 The Group  The Company
  2024 2023 2024 2023 
  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000
Net monetary liabilities denominated  
in USD  (294,492) (277,675) (230,991) (166,237)

3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont’d)
(a) Market risk (cont’d)
(i) Currency risk (cont’d)
 As at the reporting date, there are no other significant monetary balances held by the Group and the 
Company that are denominated in non-functional currency.  Differences resulting from the translation of 
financial statements into the Group’s presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
(ii) Cash flow interest rate risk
 Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. 
 The Group’s interest bearing assets are primarily short-term bank deposits with financial institutions. The 
interest rates on these deposits are monitored closely to ensure that they are maintained at favourable rates. 
The Group considers the risk of significant changes to interest rates on deposits to be unlikely.
 Interest rate exposure arises mainly from the Group’s borrowings. The Group manages its interest rate 
exposure by maintaining a prudent mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
 If the Group’s borrowings at variable rates on which effective hedges have not been entered into changes by 
the following basis points, with all other variables being held constant, the effects on profit after tax would 
be as follows:

- decrease by 25 basis points 1,410 - - -
- increase by 50 basis points - (2,763) - -

- decrease by 25 basis points 534 - - -
- increase by 50 basis points - (1,202) - -
- decrease by 50 basis points - 1,202 - -
 The Group has variable rate borrowings such as revolving credits and bank overdrafts and the Group 
considers the risk of significant changes to interest rates on these borrowings to be unlikely due to the 
relative short-term nature of the borrowings. The Group actively reviews its debt portfolio to manage the 
timings of repayment for these borrowings and monitors the interest rates on these borrowings closely to 
ensure that they are maintained at favourable rates.

3 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont’d)
(b) Credit risk
 Credit	risk	–	Measurement	of	ECL
 The Group had applied MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” on 1 April 2018 which requires the impairment of loans 
and receivables to be assessed using the expected credit loss (“ECL”) model. ECL represents a probability-
weighted estimate of the difference between the present value of contractual cash flows and the present value 
of cash flows that the Group expects to receive, over the remaining life of the financial instrument.
 The Group and the Company have the following financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
•	 Trade	receivables	
•	 Contract	assets
•	 Lease	receivables
•	 Other	receivables	(current	and	non-current)
•	 Cash	and	cash	equivalents
•	 Amounts	due	from	related	companies
•	 Financial	guarantee	contracts
•	 Redeemable	Convertible	Unsecured	Loan	Stocks	(“RCULS”)
•	 Redeemable	Unsecured	Murabahah	Stocks	(“RUMS”)
•	 RCSIDS	Deferred	Payment
(i) Trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables using simplified approach
 The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach in measuring expected credit losses which estimates a 
lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables.
 The Group assessed ECL for trade receivables based on two different approaches, namely collective 
assessment and individual debtor assessment.
 Collective approach
 To measure the expected credit losses under the collective approach, trade receivables and contract 
assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and number of days past due. The 
expected loss rates are developed based on the historical credit loss rates. The historical loss rates are 
further adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the 
ability of the customers to settle the receivables. 
 The Group has identified (i) internal credit rating and (ii) actual or expected significant adverse changes in 
business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor’s 
ability to meet its obligation to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjust the historical loss rates 
based on expected changes in these factors.
 As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets of RM1,177,556,000 and 
RM440,917,000 (2023: RM853,589,000 and RM432,016,000) respectively were assessed for impairment 
under the simplified approach. As at 31 March 2024, the Company’s trade receivables of RM56,318,000 
(2023: RM54,342,000) were assessed for impairment under the simplified approach.

(b) Credit risk (cont’d)
 Credit	risk	–	Measurement	of	ECL (cont’d)
(i) Trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables using simplified approach (cont’d)
 Individual debtor assessment
 The Group applies individual debtor assessment for debtors with different risk characteristics, where the 
credit risk information of these debtors is obtained and monitored individually. The Group assesses the 
lifetime ECL based on the PD*LGD*EAD approach, which is further defined as follows:
PD Probability of default (the likelihood that the borrower cannot pay during the contractual period)
LGD Loss given default (Percentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens)
EAD Exposure at default (Outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk)
 The Group has taken into account the probability-weighted recoverable amount determined via the 
evaluation of a range of possible outcomes. In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group considers historical data 
of each debtor by category and adjusts for forward-looking macroeconomic data. The Group has identified 
the industry and geographical area which the debtor operates in, to be the most relevant factors, and 
accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. Loss allowance 
is measured at a probability-weighted amount that reflects the possibility that a credit loss occurs and the 
possibility that no credit loss occurs. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were 
made during the reporting period.
(ii) Other receivables, amounts due from related companies, financial guarantee contracts, RCULS, RUMS and 
RCSIDS Deferred Payment issued using general 3-stage approach
 The Group and the Company use four categories for other receivables which reflect their credit risk and how 
the loss allowance is determined for each of those categories. A summary of the assumptions underpinning 
the Group’s ECL model is as follows:
Category Group’s definition of category Basis of 
recognising ECL
Performing Debtors have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to 
meet contractual cash flows
12 months ECL
Underperforming Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit risk or 
significant increase in credit risk is presumed if interest and/or 
principal repayments are 30 days past due
Lifetime ECL
Non-performing Interest and/or principal repayments are 90 days past due or 
there is evidence indicating the asset is credit impaired
Lifetime ECL 
(credit-impaired)
Write-off There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery based on unavailability of debtor’s 
sources of income or assets to generate sufficient future cash 
flows to repay the amount
Asset is written off
 Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12 months ECL or lifetime ECL using a 
PD*LGD*EAD methodology. 
(iii) Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9 and the identified 
impairment was immaterial since the bank balances are mainly deposits with banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies.

 Credit	risk	–	Measurement	of	ECL (cont’d)
(iv) Financial guarantee contracts
 The Company provides corporate guarantee to financial institutions on certain subsidiaries’ borrowings 
facilities as of the reporting date. 
 All of the financial guarantee contracts have low risks of default and historically there were no instances 
where these financial guarantee contracts were called upon by the parties of which the financial guarantee 
contracts were issued to. Accordingly, no loss allowance was identified based on 12 months ECL.
 As the Company does not hold any collateral from its subsidiaries for the corporate guarantee provided to 
the financial institutions, the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk as disclosed in Note 3(c) to the 
financial statements is the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ borrowings as at the reporting date.
(c) Liquidity risk
 The Group treasury actively monitors and manages its debt maturity profile, operating cash flows and the 
availability of funding (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents) so as to ensure 
that all refinancing, repayment and funding needs are met.  As part of its overall prudent liquidity management, 
the Group maintains sufficient levels of cash or cash convertible investments (Note 47) to meet its working 
capital requirements.  In addition, the Group strives to maintain available banking facilities of a reasonable level 
to its overall debt position.  As far as possible, the Group raises committed funding from both capital markets 
and financial institutions and prudently balances its portfolio with some short term funding so as to achieve 
overall cost effectiveness.
 The tables below analyse the financial liabilities of the Group and the Company into relevant maturity groupings

(d) Capital risk
 The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholders value. In order to 
maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, obtain new financing facilities or dispose assets to 
reduce borrowings.
 Management monitors capital based on the Group’s and the Company’s gearing ratios. The Group and the 
Company are also required by the banks to maintain certain gearing ratios. The Group’s and the Company’s 
strategies are to maintain a gearing ratio of not greater than 1 time. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt 
divided by equity capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (excluding trade and other payables) less 
deposits, cash and bank balances. Equity capital is equivalent to capital and reserves attributable to owners of 
the Company.
 The gearing ratios as at the reporting dates are as follows:
 The Group  The Company
  2024 2023 2024 2023 
  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000  RM’000

 Gearing ratio  0.26 0.26 0.15 0.10
* Total borrowings of the Group include bonds, term loans, government support loan, revolving credits, 
bankers’ acceptances, bank overdrafts and letters of credit. 
 Total borrowings of the Company include bonds, term loans and revolving credits.
 The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements in the form of loan covenants.  
The Group and the Company monitor compliance with loan covenants based on the terms of the respective loan 
agreements. The Group and the Company are in compliance with such externally imposed capital requirements 
as at the reporting date.
 During the financial year, the Group has obtained a waiver from its lender for the compliance of debt covenant 
in relation to debt service coverage ratio for a term loan. The Group did not breach the debt covenant as of 
reporting date.

B. Principal features of Government Support Loan
 The principal features of the Government Support Loan of a subsidiary of Road Builder (M) Holdings Bhd 
(“RBH”), a subsidiary of the Company, are as follows:
 The Government Support Loan is in respect of an agreement between Kuantan Port Consortium Sdn Bhd,  
a subsidiary of RBH and the Government of Malaysia (“the Government”) in connection with the reimbursable 
infrastructure cost for the purpose of financing the dredging of the new harbour basin. In the financial year 2007, 
the instalment payments were re-scheduled to commence on 15 June 2006 and are repayable over 22 variable 
yearly instalments, which are interest-free.
 The Government Support Loan is secured by a negative pledge and by a deed of assignment over:
(i) the balance of the revenue from the scheduled leases, tenancies and new sub leases and tenancies granted 
after the commencement date of the Privatisation Agreement after deducting the amounts payable to the 
Kuantan Port Authority; and
(ii) all other revenue received from the Kuantan port operations.

19 LEASE LIABILITIES
 The Group leases certain lands, office buildings, office equipment and plant and machinery. Rental contracts are 
entered into for fixed periods ranging between 1 to 31 years with extension options. Lease terms on the rental 
contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The rental 
contracts do not impose any covenants.
 The Company leases office spaces and office equipment. Rental contracts are entered into for fixed periods ranging 
between 3 to 5 years with extension options. Lease terms on the rental contracts are negotiated on an individual 
basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The rental contracts do not impose any covenants.

Total lease liabilities  79,896 70,850 16,879 9,726
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  
commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the entities’ incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent 
to the initial recognition, the Group measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest 
on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying 
amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications. The maturity analysis of the lease liabilities as at the 
reporting date is disclosed in Note 3(c).
 During the financial year, total cash outflow for the leases (including low valued assets or short term leases) for the 
Group and the Company amounted to RM33,694,000 (2023: RM24,896,000) and RM2,128,000 (2023: RM2,125,000) 
respectively.
 Leases as lessor
 The Group leases certain leasehold land, investment property and right-of-use assets to related and non-related 
parties. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases because they do not transfer substantially all of 
the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. The following table sets out the maturity analysis  
of the total undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date:

20 DEFERRED TAXATION (cont’d)
 The amounts of unutilised deductible temporary differences, unutilised investment allowance and unused tax  
losses for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows:

 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as they may not be used to offset taxable 
profits of other subsidiaries in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have a recent history of losses and 
some of the subsidiaries are not expected to generate sufficient taxable profits before the expiry of the unused tax 
losses.

Penang State Government in connection with the completion of the Jelutong Expressway Project.
 Under the RLC Agreement, the advances received from the State Government for the reimbursement of land 
cost totalling RM33,180,000 are repayable to the State Government as follows:
 Percentage of
 advances to be
 repaid to the Penang
 State Government
 %
36 months from the commencement of Stage 3 of the Construction Works 
of Jelutong Expressway or from the completion of alienation of  
Parcels A2 and B1, whichever is the later (1 st  Payment) 30
12 months from the date of the Certificate of Completion of the entire 
Jelutong Expressway or from the date of the 1 st  Payment, 
whichever is the later (2 nd  Payment) 30
12 months from the date of the 2 nd  Payment  40
   100
 JDSB had completed Stage 3 of the Construction Works in March 2015 and the alienation of Parcels A2 and B1 
has yet to commence as at the reporting date.
 The advances on reimbursable land cost are interest free. However, if JDSB fails to pay the Penang State 
Government any of the instalment payments above by their respective due dates, JDSB shall be liable to pay 
to the Penang State Government interest at a fixed rate of 8% per annum on any such outstanding instalment 
payments.
(b) This represents the present value of the deferred land cost of RM207,936,000 (2023: RM127,308,000) in 
connection with a mixed development in Kuala Lumpur, which will become payable as the development 
progresses in accordance with the contractual terms.
(c) Deposits I represent performance deposits received from a school operator, which are mainly to safeguard 
default or early termination of the lease agreement being entered into between an indirect subsidiary and  
the school operator during the construction period of the school buildings and also to guarantee rental for a 
lock-in-period of the first six years of the lease period. The performance deposits are placed in a designated 
fixed deposit account and shall be returned to the school operator upon the expiry of the sixth year of the  
lease period.
 Deposits II represent the deposits received from the tenants for lease agreements which  expire between 3 and 
15 years and will be repayable to the tenants upon the expiry of the lease terms.
(d) Refundable membership securities are in relation to Marina Membership and Composite Membership of the 
golf and marina club of Sebana Golf & Marina Resort Berhad (“SGMR”), which is an indirect subsidiary of the 
Company. The membership securities of Marina Membership and Composite Membership are repayable on 
31 December 2053 and 31 March 2056 respectively, unless the memberships are redeemed, purchased or 
cancelled.

22 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES (cont’d)
(e)  On 16 June 2015, Kuantan Port Consortium Sdn Bhd (“KPC”), which is a 60%-owned subsidiary of Road 
Builder (M) Holdings Bhd, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new 
Privatisation Agreement with the Government of Malaysia (“Government”) and Kuantan Port Authority (“KPA”) 
(“Privatisation Agreement”), whereby KPC is granted a 30-year port concession in relation to the development, 
operation and management of Kuantan Port and a new deep water terminal adjacent to the existing Kuantan 
Port.
 The lease payables represent the annual lease rental payable to Kuantan Port Authority over the concession 
periods to manage and operate the port in relation to the concession asset recognised in Note 28 to the 
financial statements. 
(f) As at the reporting date, the amount owing to a subsidiary is unsecured and payable after twelve months.
23 RETIREMENT BENEFITS
(a) Defined contribution plan
 The Company and its subsidiaries in Malaysia contribute to the Employees Provident Fund, the national defined 
contribution plan. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further financial obligations. 
(b) Unfunded defined benefit plan 
 A local indirect subsidiary of the Company operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme (“the scheme”)  
for its eligible employees. Under the scheme, eligible employees are entitled to retirement benefits by applying 
a certain factor (either 0.50, 0.75 or 1.00 depending on the number of years of service with the company) 
to the 100% of final salary on attainment of the retirement age of 55 years based on the number of years of 
service with the company. The net obligation in respect of the scheme, calculated using the projected unit 
credit method is determined by an actuarial valuation carried out every 3 years by a qualified actuary. The last 
actuarial valuation was performed for the financial year ended 31 March 2022.
 The amounts of unfunded defined benefit recognised in the statement of financial position may be analysed as 
follows:

 Port infrastructure comprises a port concession in Malaysia, with a concession period of 30 years ending in 2045.
 On 22 November 1997, Kuantan Port Consortium Sdn Bhd (“KPC“), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered 
into a Privatisation Agreement (“Agreement”) with the Government of Malaysia (“Government”) and Kuantan Port 
Authority (“KPA”), a concession to manage, operate and develop Kuantan Port (“Port”) for a period of 30 years 
commencing from 1 January 1998.
 On 16 June 2015, the said Agreement was superseded and replaced with a new Privatisation Agreement (“PA”), 
whereby the Government and KPA had requested KPC to develop a New Deep Water Terminal (“NDWT”) adjacent 
to the existing port. The concession commenced on 1 June 2015 for a period of 30 years and is subject to an 
extension of 30 years (i.e. 60 years from 2015) provided that the obligations under the PA are fulfilled by KPC 
within the prescribed period. In determining the concession period of 60 years, the Group considered all facts and 
circumstances that create an economic incentive to support the extension of 30 years. The extension of 30 years is 
also included as part of the concession period as the Group is reasonably certain to fulfil the obligations under the 
PA.
 Upon expiry of the concession period, KPC shall cease to manage, operate and maintain the Port and handover all 
the port infrastructures and movable assets in operational condition at no cost to KPA.
 The amounts of construction revenue and losses recognised during the financial year on exchanging construction 
services for port concession amounted to RM562,000 and RM174,800 (2023: construction revenue and losses of 
RM119,000 and RM1,206,000) respectively.

 contra against an amount due from the subsidiary.
(b) (i) IJM Investments (L) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company issued a total of 23,999 RPS for  
 a total cash consideration of RM113,499,271.
 (ii) IJM Investments (M) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company  issued a total of 324,121 RPS  
 for a total cash consideration of RM1,178,975.
(c) Preferential dividends of the RPS are non-cumulative and its payment shall be at the discretion of the directors 
of issuers (i.e subsidiaries) at a rate to be determined from time to time. In addition, the RPS shall be redeemed 
at the option of the issuers and at a redemption price to be determined by the Directors at any time by notice 
in writing to the holder (i.e the Company).   
 The Group’s effective equity interest in the subsidiaries and their respective principal activities and countries of 
incorporation are set out in Note 52 to the financial statements.
 The amounts owing by subsidiaries are unsecured, bear interest at rates ranging from 5.0% to 5.5% (2023: 4.5% 
to 5.0%) per annum and are repayable on demand. However, the management does not intend to demand for 
repayment of the amounts owing by subsidiaries within the period of twelve months.
 As at the reporting date, the Company performed an impairment test on its investments in subsidiaries with history 
of losses and changes in asset monetisation plan, where the Company subscribed to the preference shares issued 
by the subsidiaries in the current year. Accordingly, during the financial year, the Company has recognised an 
impairment of its investments in subsidiaries in Malaysia and outside Malaysia of RM50,000,000 and RM113,499,000 
respectively. The impairment was recognised under other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive 
income. 
 The impairment of investment in a subsidiary in Malaysia was determined based on its recoverable amount, calculated 
using the subsidiary’s net liquid assets available to support the recoverability of its investment. 
 The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) of its investments in subsidiaries outside Malaysia 
were determined based on the expected dividends to be received from their respective business operations which 
are outside Malaysia using value in use method.

29 SUBSIDIARIES (cont’d)
 The following tables set out the key assumptions for those CGUs:
 Tollway Concessions
Basis of recoverable amount  
determination Significant assumptions 2024
The recoverable amount is based 
on net cash flow from tollway 
operations, estimated traffic volume 
growth rates and approved toll 
rates as per concession agreement.
Traffic volume growth rate is based 
on the most recent traffic survey 
conducted by an independent 
traffic consultant, further adjusted 
based on actual historical traffic 
volumes
Cash flow forecast periods
Discount rate
9% and 10% per annum
Concession period of 18 and 19 
years, which is up to financial year 
2043 and 2044.
Cost of equity - 12.5%
 Property Development
Basis of recoverable amount  
determination Significant assumptions 2024
The recoverable amount is based 
on the cash flows after financing 
activities from disposal of the 
subsidiaries’ unsold completed 
properties, property development 
costs and land held for property 
development.
The market value of the completed 
building stocks is based on the 
recent transacted prices by the 
entities.
The market value of the lands 
held for property development is 
determined based on independent 
valuation using the comparison 
method by reference to the recent 
land sale transaction in the vicinity.
Price per square foot for the 
completed building stocks
Price per acre, which varies 
significantly depending on the 
location of the undeveloped lands.
 A reasonable change in the key assumptions would impact the recoverable amount as of the reporting date as 
follows:
Cash-generating units Scenarios Impact to changes in recoverable 
amount (RM’million)
Tollway operation Decrease in traffic volume by 
2% and 7% for two tollways 
respectively
1% increase in discount rate
Net decrease of RM241.6 million
Net decrease of RM55.2 million
Property development 10% change in price per acre of 
undeveloped lands
Net increase/decrease of RM75.1 
million

 7.40% to 7.65% (2023: 6.4% to 7.4%) per annum. 
** The allowance for impairment of RUMS was in respect of the recognition of expected credit losses after taking 
 into account the time value of money arising from changes in the expected timing of repayment of RUMS.
The Group assesses the expected credit losses for RUMS using a probability-weighted estimate of the expected 
cash flow scenarios to be generated from the associate’s toll operations over the concession period.
The significant assumptions used in the impairment assessments are as follows:
Assumptions 2024 (range of assumptions considered  
in the scenarios)
Annual growth rate in traffic volume
 
Progressive build up in average daily traffic to reach 
the peak by 2027 or 2031, with an average traffic 
volume growth of 3% thereafter
Timing of periodic profit payments Periodic profit payments commencing from 2033 up 
to maturity date of 2056 or 2058
Discount rate 5.0% to 6.7%
 The expected cash flows for RUMS was estimated using annual traffic growth scenarios and their weightings.  
The Group makes an estimate on the projected traffic volume based on the latest independent traffic survey, adjusted 
for historical traffic volumes, which are subject to estimation uncertainties. External factors such as population 
growth, employment rates, and urbanisation trends may significantly influence the actual traffic volume growth rate, 
which may materially affect the results of the impairment assessments. In addition, the Group exercised significant 
judgement in selecting and weighting the traffic scenarios to derive the probability-weighted estimated cash  
flows amount.
 As of the reporting date, a 10% change in the projected traffic volume could change the probability-weighted 
estimated cash flows of RUMS by RM35.8 million.

In 2007 and 2009, the Company had subscribed for a total of RM240,000,000 nominal value of Redeemable 
Convertible Unsecured Loan Stocks (“RCULS”), maturing on 8 February 2026, as issued by Lebuhraya Kajang-

(B) RCSIDS
 In 2013, the Company acquired RM90,109,292 nominal value of Redeemable Convertible Secured Islamic 
Debt Securities (“RCSIDS”), as issued by LEKAS, a joint venture of the Company, matured on 10 April 2023. 
Subsequently, the maturity date was modified up to 29 September 2023 with the third indulgence letter dated 
27 July 2023 issued by Malaysian Trustees Berhad (trustee for the RCSIDS) in respect of the holders’ consent 
for the modification of maturity date. 
The terms of the RCSIDS are as follows:
(i) The RCSIDS bear a fixed, cumulative and non-compounding profit rate of 7.9% per annum. 
(ii) Every RM1 nominal value of the RCSIDS or every RM1 profit payable on such RCSIDS can be converted into 
1 ordinary share of Lekas at the conversion price of RM1. The profit in respect of the RCSIDS can only be 
converted into ordinary shares if it is done in conjunction with the conversion of the corresponding RCSIDS.
(iii) The conversion period commences from the date immediately after the issue date and ends on the maturity 
date.
(iv) The RCSIDS may, prior to the maturity date, be redeemed in part or in full at their aggregate nominal value 
plus accrued and unpaid profit. No cash payment will be made for the principal amount in respect of the 
RCSIDS and the profit earned on the relevant profit payment dates during the subsistence of the syndicated 
term loan facility and until the maturity date. Any early redemption shall take place on a profit payment date 
or such other dates as may be mutually agreed between the parties. All outstanding RCSIDS and cumulative 
profit shall be redeemed by the issuer on the maturity date. The RCSIDS which have been redeemed will 
be cancelled and cannot be reissued and the outstanding profit which has not been converted into new 
ordinary shares shall be paid by the issuer in the form of cash payment on the maturity date.
 Pursuant to a letter of offer dated 13 June 2023, LEKAS obtained the Tawarruq Asset Financing facilities of 
up to RM1,051.5 million. On 29 September 2023 (redemption date), RCSIDS was redeemed and it entails the 
redemption of all the outstanding principal amount of the RCSIDS that have not been converted, at the nominal 
value, and all cumulative profit of the RCSIDS, except for 26.84% of the cumulative profit (“RCSIDS Deferred 
Payment”). RCSIDS was cancelled upon the redemption.
(C) RCSIDS Deferred Payment
 RCSIDS Deferred Payment is non-convertible, bears a fixed, cumulative and non-compounding profit rate of 
7.9% per annum and shall be for a tenure of up to 267 months from the date of RCSIDS redemption.

 The amounts owing by joint ventures of the Group and the Company are mainly unsecured advances for the joint 
ventures’ working capital requirements which bear interest at rates ranging from 5.0% to 7.9% (2023: 4.5% to 7.9%) 
per annum and at 7.9% (2023: 7.9%) per annum respectively.
 Movements on the Group’s and the Company’s allowance for impairment of RCULS are as follows:

 Reversal of impairment during the year   5(b) (56,996) -
 At 31 March     340,765 397,761
During the financial year, the Group and the Company recognised a reversal of impairment amounting to RM57.0 
million. This reversal occurred following the completion of the restructuring exercise on 30 June 2023, after fulfilling 
the conditions precedents stipulated under the Third Supplemental Agreement dated 30 December 2022. As part of 
the restructuring, the toll concession period for LEKAS was extended from 8 May 2039 to 8 May 2064 at reduced 
toll rates.
In assessing the expected credit losses for RCULS, the Group and the Company used a probability-weighted 
estimate of the expected cash flow scenarios to be generated from LEKAS’s toll operations over the extended 
concession period of 40 years, up to the year 2064.

Financial StatementS ANNUAL REPORT 2024

31 JOINT VENTURES (cont’d)
The significant assumptions used in the impairment assessments are as follows:
Assumptions 2024 (range of assumptions considered  
in the scenarios)
Traffic volume growth rate 3.0% to 4.0% per annum
Projected period Concession period of 40 years, up to the year 2064
Discount rate 7.9%
The expected cash flows for RCULS was estimated using annual traffic growth scenarios and their weightings.  
The Group and the Company make an estimate on the projected traffic volume based on the latest independent 
traffic survey, adjusted for historical traffic volumes, which are subject to estimation uncertainties. External factors 
such as population growth, employment rates, and urbanisation trends may significantly influence the actual traffic 
growth rate, which may materially affect the results of the impairment assessment. In addition, the Group and  
the Company exercised significant judgement in selecting and weighting the traffic scenarios to derive the  
probability-weighted cash flows amount.
As of the reporting date, a 5% change in the projected traffic volume could change the probability-weighted  
cash flows of RCULS by RM36.8 million.
Movements on the Group’s and the Company’s allowance for impairment of amounts owing by joint ventures are 
as follows:

The Group has carried out an assessment on the recoverability of the amounts owing by joint ventures and 
management believes that the current impairment recognised is adequate.

 The finance lease receivables as at the reporting date arise from the lease agreements entered into between 
indirect subsidiaries of the Company and lessors to lease buildings to third parties for the lease terms ranging 
between 10 and 15 years. The Group does not have any significant exposure to credit risk from the lease 
receivables as the ownership and rights to the buildings revert to the Group in the event of default.
(b) As at the end of the preceding financial year, the balances represented amounts owing by a subsidiary of a joint 
operation partner. The amounts were unsecured advances which bore interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum. 
During the financial year, the outstanding balances were fully repaid.
(c) The trade receivables are unsecured and arising from deferred payment construction projects. During the 
financial year, the outstanding balances of RM91,535,000 which bore interest at 5% per annum were reclassified 
to current assets as the balances were due for repayment within a year as of the reporting date.
 The trade receivables balance as at 31 March 2024 is interest free and management has incorporated the time 
value of money for the measurement of the receivables as at the reporting date.
(d) The other receivables are secured advances which bear interest at a rate of 6.5% (2023: 6.5%) per annum.  
As at 31 March 2024, the Group has not recognised loss allowance for the net balances of RM93,544,000  
(2023: RM73,543,000) which were past due as the receivables are secured by collaterals. Several land titles 
were deposited with or charged by the Group as collaterals.
(e) The balances represent outstanding disposal proceed in relation to the disposal of 2 tug boats in the preceding 
financial year, which are secured by collaterals and bear interest at a rate of 4.9% (2023: 4.9%) per annum.
(f) The balances represent prepayment paid to an external party for its future services to be rendered in relation to 
matters related to the development activities to be carried out by the Innova Partnership in the United Kingdom.
(g) The balances represent downpayment paid by the Group to suppliers for the purchase of plant and equipment

 During the financial year, the Group has recorded a net write down of its inventories for property development 
costs of RM83,714,000. The write down of the inventories was due to a recent feasibility study conducted by 
the Group which has indicated that there were geographical constraints at the construction site and increase  
in the prices of the construction materials. This caused limitations to the product mix that can be developed 
and the viability of the Group’s initial development plan was affected. Accordingly, property development costs 
were written down based on the valuation reports obtained by the Group from professional valuers during  
the financial year.
 During the financial year, finance cost of RM35,768,000 (2023: RM32,361,000) (Note 9) has been capitalised in 
property development costs.

 Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired:
Credit terms of trade receivables range from payment in advance to 150 days (2023: range from payment in advance 
to 120 days).
Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired comprise:
•	 Receivables	in	relation	to	construction	business	arising	from	rendering	of	construction	services	to	companies	 
with a good collection track record with the Group and the Company. These receivables include retention sums 
which are to be settled in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts;
•	 Receivables	in	 relation	 to	 property	 development	 business	 arising	 from	 sale	 of	 development	 units	 to	 large	 
number of property purchasers with end financing facilities from reputable end-financiers. The ownership and

•	 Receivables	from	other	external	parties	with	no	history	of	default.
Trade receivables, other receivables and amounts owing by subsidiaries that are impaired:
The receivables are individually impaired either because of significant delays in collection periods or because the 
debtors are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations. As at 31 March 2024, trade and other receivables of the 
Group and the Company of RM144,764,000 (2023: RM171,265,000) and RM214,396,000 (2023: RM113,914,000)

The allowance for impairment of receivables during the year at the Company level was mainly in relation to amounts

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont’d) 
For the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2024
36 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (cont’d)
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables are limited due to the Group’s large number 
of customers, who are dispersed over a broad spectrum of industries and businesses. The Group has carried 
out an assessment on the recoverability of these balances and management believes that the current impairment 
recognised is adequate.
The amounts owing by subsidiaries and associates are unsecured and repayable on demand. Certain amounts 
owing by subsidiaries and associates bear interest at rates ranging from 5.0% to 7.7% (2023: 4.5% to 7.9%) per 
annum. The Company has carried out an assessment on the recoverability of these balances and management 
believes that the carrying amount is recoverable.
The amount owing by a joint operation partner mainly comprises receivables arising from the rendering of construction 
services to the joint operations. The credit terms of these trade related balances are 30 days (2023: 30 days). 
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of 
receivables mentioned above.
There is no material difference between the carrying values of trade and other receivables and their fair values, due 
to the short-term duration of the receivables.

In the preceding financial year, the Group recognised a goodwill arising from the acquisition of a subsidiary, 
Globalcomm Solutions Sdn Bhd (Note 46(a)(i)) as the goodwill allocated to the CGU was supportable by the net 
recoverable amounts.
There are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions used that would cause the carrying amount 
of the CGUs to materially exceed the recoverable amounts.

46 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES (cont’d)
(a) In the preceding financial year, the Group acquired/incorporated the following subsidiaries: (cont’d)
(i)  Details of cash flows arising from the acquisition were as follows:
  The Group 
  RM’000
 Total purchase consideration paid  (18,382)
 Less: Cash and cash equivalents of subsidiary acquired  3,471
 Net cash outflow to the Group on acquisition  (14,911)
 The acquired business contributed revenue and profit before taxation of RM17,406,000 and RM4,348,000 
to the Group for the period from 16 August 2022, date of completion of acquisition, to 31 March 2023.
(ii) On 25 November 2022, IJM Properties Sdn Bhd (“IJMP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IJM Land Berhad 
(“IJMLB”), which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a conditional share 
sale agreement (“SSA”) with WCE Maju Sdn Bhd (“WCEM”) and KEB Management Sdn Bhd (“KEBM”) to 
acquire 400,000 ordinary shares (representing WCEM’s 30% and KEBM’s 10% equity interests) in Radiant 
Pillar Sdn Bhd (“RPSB”) for a total cash consideration of RM494.0 million. Both WCEM and KEBM are  
wholly-owned subsidiaries of WCE Holdings Berhad (“WCEH”). 
  On 28 February 2023, the SSA was completed in accordance with the terms of the SSA. Upon completion 
of this acquisition, the effective interest in RPSB by IJMP had increased from 60% to 100%. The Company 
owned 26.65% equity interest in WCEH and accounted for WCEH as an associate. WCEH also owned 
40% of RPSB. At the Group level, the effective interest of the Company in RPSB approximated 70.66%  
(60% via IJMLB and approximately 10% via WCEH).
    The additional interest in RPSB had been accounted for as transaction with non-controlling interests (“NCI”) 
by the Group where the difference between the proceeds and the NCI amount was recorded in the Group 
retained profits. As the NCI in RPSB was 29.34%, part of the proceeds paid for the 40% equity interest of 
RPSB (10.66%) was deemed as capital contribution provided by the Group to WCEH.  
  The Group 
  RM’000
 Total purchase consideration  494,000
 Less: IJM Group’s share of proceeds received by WCEH 
 (deemed capital contribution in WCEH)  (131,651)
 Net proceeds from the acquisition based on effective interest  362,349
 Less: 29.34% NCI related to RPSB at the Group level  (357,467)
 Retained profits (loss from transaction with NCI)  4,882
(iii) On 28 April 2022, the Company incorporated a 100%-owned subsidiary, namely IJM Treasury Management 
Sdn Bhd.
(iv) On 2 March 2023, IJM RE Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, incorporated a  
100%-owned subsidiary, namely Exio Logistics Sdn Bhd.
 The acquisitions (iii) & (iv) had no significant effect on the financial results of the Group in the preceding financial 
year and the financial position of the Group as at the end of the preceding financial year.

48 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is assumed to be the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged  
or settled between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
 Quoted market prices, when available, are used as a measure of fair values. However, for a significant portion of 
the Group’s and of the Company’s financial instruments, quoted market prices do not exist. For such financial 
instruments, fair values presented are estimates derived using the discounted value of future cash flows or other 
valuation techniques. These techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used 
and judgements made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of 
future cash flows and other factors. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the 
resulting fair values.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements of IJM Corporation Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”)  
give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and of their 
financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016  
in Malaysia.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial 
position as at 31 March 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of comprehensive income, statements 
of changes in equity and cash flow statements of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and 
notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 6 to 177.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of 
the financial statements” section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct 
and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board  
for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence 
Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and 
the IESBA Code.
Our audit approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the  
financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective 
judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering 
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of 
internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes 
and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Revenue and costs recognition of the Group
i)  Construction contracts  
Revenue: RM1,656,164,000 
Cost: RM1,597,117,000
ii)  Property development activities  
Revenue: RM1,972,430,000 
Cost: RM1,320,615,000
Refer to Notes 9(a) and 9(b) for the material accounting 
policies and Notes 2(b), 2(c), 4(a) and 4(b) to the financial 
statements.
We focused on this area because the accounting for 
construction contracts and property development 
activities is inherently complex as it involved the use 
of significant judgements and estimates made by 
management in the following areas: 
a) Stage of completion of the projects;
b) Whether any liquidated ascertained damages (“LAD”) 
is required for construction contracts;
c) Extent of costs incurred for construction contracts 
and property development projects, and construction 
costs or property development costs yet to be 
incurred; and
d) Status of variation orders and claims with customers.
We evaluated and tested the key controls in respect of 
the review and approval of construction contracts and 
property development project budgets to assess the 
reliability of these budgets.
We discussed with management and read management 
meeting minutes to understand the overall progress 
of construction and property development projects. 
With regards to construction contracts whereby actual 
progress is behind planned progress, we obtained 
explanation from management on the cause of the 
delays, inspected correspondences with customers 
and sub-contractors and corroborated key judgement 
applied by management as to whether any LAD is 
required.  
We checked the extent of costs incurred to date to 
internal quantity surveyors’ latest valuations or sub-
contractors’ claim certificates to corroborate the stage 
of completion. Where costs have not been billed or 
certified, we assessed the adequacy of management’s 
accruals of such costs by checking subsequent 
contractors’ claim certificates or approvals from internal 
quantity surveyors.
We checked the reasonableness of the estimated total 
construction costs and property development costs, 
including subsequent changes to the costs, by agreeing 
to supporting documentation; i.e. approved budgets, 
quotations, correspondences, contracts and variation 
orders with sub-contractors.
We had discussions with management to understand 
the nature of the variation orders and claims included 
in revenue and inspected correspondences from the 
customers and minutes of meetings to corroborate the 
key judgement applied by management. 
Based on the procedures performed above, we noted no 
material exceptions in the revenue and costs recognition 
for the Group’s construction contracts and property 
development activities.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (cont’d)
Key audit matters (cont’d)
Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Recoverability of trade receivables
Refer to Notes 14 and 22 for the material accounting 
policies and Notes 2(g), 3(b), 33 and 36 to the financial 
statements.
The Group assessed on a forward-looking basis the 
expected credit loss (“ECL”) associated with its trade 
receivables using the simplified approach.
ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the 
difference between the present value of contractual 
cash flows and the present value of cash flows that the 
Group expects to receive, over the remaining life of the 
financial instrument, which requires the use of significant 
assumptions about future economic conditions and 
credit risk of the customers. 
The Group assessed ECL for trade receivables based on 
two approaches, namely the collective assessment and 
individual debtor assessment. To measure the expected 
credit losses under the collective approach, trade 
receivables have been grouped based on shared credit 
risk characteristics and number of days past due. The 
Group applies individual debtor assessment for debtors 
with different risk characteristics, where the credit risk 
information of these debtors is obtained and monitored 
individually.
The measurement of ECL incorporates expected loss 
rates, time value of money, forward looking information 
and probability-weighted estimates.
As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s trade receivables 
prior to loss allowance was RM1,196,450,000, of 
which RM118,766,000 has been provided for as loss 
allowance. 
We focused on this area because management’s 
assessment of ECL requires significant judgement over 
the expected loss rates, timing of the recovery of the 
debts, forward looking information and probability-
weighted estimates.
For ECL measured under the collective approach,  
we checked that the trade receivables have been 
grouped based on similar credit risk characteristics and 
age of receivables. We also checked that the expected 
loss rates were developed based on the historical credit 
losses rate.
For ECL measured under the individual debtor 
assessment, we checked the expected timing 
and quantum of receipts of trade receivables by 
comparing them to the historical payment trend of 
individual customers, considered collaterals held by  
the Group and sighted to correspondences on 
settlement arrangements agreed between the Group 
and the customers. We also held discussions with 
management to understand the status of the ongoing 
negotiations on the recovery of trade receivables and 
corroborated the key assumptions included in the ECL 
model, namely on likelihood, quantum and timing of 
receipt of the balances.
For both collective assessment and individual debtor 
assessment, we have assessed and considered the 
reasonableness of the forward looking information 
included in management’s assessment and the revision 
in overall loss rates used in the calculation of expected 
credit loss provisions.
We found management’s assessment of its loss 
allowance of trade receivables to be materially consistent 
with the supporting information provided to us.

Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Recoverability of debt instruments in equity 
accounted investments
Refer to Note 22 for the material accounting policies, 
Notes 2(g), 30 and 31 to the financial statements.
As of 31 March 2024, the Group’s investments in 
Redeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock 
(“RCULS”) of a joint venture and Redeemable 
Unsecured Murabahah Stock (“RUMS”) of an associate 
have net carrying amounts of  RM136,214,000 and 
RM295,448,000,  respectively. Additionally, there have 
been material changes in the allowance for impairment 
of RCULS during the financial year where a reversal of 
impairment of RM56,996,000 have been recognised, 
arising from the extension of the tollway concession 
period of a joint venture.
The Group applies the general 3-stage ECL model 
under MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” to assess the 
impairment of the RCULS and RUMS. ECL represents a 
probability-weighted estimate of the difference between 
the present value of contractual cash flows and the 
present value of the cash flows that the Group expects 
to receive over the remaining tenure of the RCULS and 
RUMS, based on the projected future cash flows from 
the tollway concession operations of the joint venture 
and associate that are available for the repayment 
of principal and interest of the instruments up to their 
respective maturity dates.
We focused on this area because management’s 
assessment of ECL on RCULS and RUMS requires 
significant judgement and estimates in determining the 
projected future cash flows from the tollway concession 
operations of the joint venture and associate, which will 
affect the timing of the recovery of these instruments.
In determining the present value of the cash flows 
the Group expects to receive over the remaining life 
of the instruments, we have performed the following 
procedures or reviewed the component auditor’s 
workpapers with respect of the expected cash flows to 
be generated from the tollway concession operations  
of the joint venture and associate respectively. Our work 
include the following audit procedures:
•			Checked	 the	 projected	 traffic	 volume	 used	 in	
the projection of future cash flows to the traffic 
consultant’s report or historical trend;
•			Checked	that	the	toll	rates	used	in	the	projection	are	
in accordance with those stipulated in the concession 
agreement; 
•			Checked	that	the	tax	expenses	are	calculated	based	
on statutory tax rate, the repayment of external 
borrowings and interests are in accordance with the 
loan agreements and the required capital expenditure 
and maintenance costs are based on the amounts 
authorised by the Board of Directors of the joint 
venture and associate; and
•			Assessed	 the	 competency	 and	 objectivity	 of	 the	
traffic consultant by considering their professional 
qualifications and experience.
In addition, we have checked the appropriateness of the 
discount rate used to derive the expected cash flows of 
RCULS and RUMS for the purpose of calculation of the 
allowance for impairment.
Based on the above procedures performed, we noted 
no material exceptions.
Recoverability of the carrying amounts of inventories
i)  Land held for property development - 
RM550,936,000
ii)   Property development costs - RM5,115,574,000 
iii)  Completed development units - RM908,715,000
Refer to Notes 11(a), 11(b) and 11(c) for the material 
accounting policies and Notes 5(a), 5(b), 35, 35(a) and 
35(b) to the financial statements.
For inventories which have recent sale transactions, we 
compared the carrying amount of these development 
units (including costs yet to be incurred for property 
development costs), on a sample basis, to the 
selling prices stated in the signed sale and purchase 
agreements, net of discounts given.

Recoverability of the carrying amounts of inventories 
(cont’d)
We focused on the recoverability of the carrying amount 
of inventories because of the estimates made by 
management in determining the net realisable values.
Management assessed the net realisable value of the 
completed development units and land held for property 
development based on estimates derived from recent 
transacted prices or revised selling prices in light of the 
latest economic condition and future market outlook, net 
of expected discounts to be given which were approved 
by the Directors.
For property development costs, management has also 
considered the costs yet to be incurred to complete 
the development project before comparing to the net 
realisable value.
Based on management’s assessment, the Group’s 
property development costs were written down by 
RM83,714,000 during the financial year.
For inventories which did not have recent sale 
transactions, we compared the carrying amounts of 
these development units (including costs yet to be 
incurred for property development costs), on a sample 
basis, to the recent transacted prices of comparable 
development units in similar or nearby locations, and 
adjusted for the size of the units.
For property development costs, we tested the operating 
effectiveness of the key control in respect of the review and 
approval of project cost budgets to assess the reliability 
of these budgets and the determination of the costs  
yet to be incurred to complete the development project.
For inventories which management has relied on 
independent valuations, we read the valuation reports 
issued by the independent valuers and discussed with 
the independent valuers to understand and evaluate 
the appropriateness of valuation methodology, 
assumptions and adjustments applied, which include 
types, conditions, ages and sizes of the properties. 
We also compared the values of the properties by the 
independent valuers to available information through 
market research.
We discussed with management on the basis used to 
determine the write down or reversal of write down of 
certain inventories at the period end based on their net 
realisable values, and checked, on a sample basis, to the 
Group’s latest sales plan and campaigns and expected 
costs to be incurred to complete the sale transactions. 
We also checked, on a sample basis, the reasonableness 
of the assumptions used in the calculation of the net 
realisable values.
Based on the above procedures performed, we noted 
no material exceptions.
Recoverability of the Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries
Refer to Note 4 for the material accounting policies  
and Notes 2(i) and 29 to the financial statements.
The Company has investments in subsidiaries outside 
Malaysia totalling RM1,570,149,000 before the provision 
of impairment. We focused on the recoverability of  
the Company’s carrying amount of these investments  
in subsidiaries because of the estimates and  
judgements made by management in determining the 
recoverable amounts.
In determining the recoverable amounts of the 
investments in subsidiaries outside Malaysia, we 
have considered the cash flows available for dividend 
distribution to the Company from these subsidiaries.
With regards to future cash flows to be generated from 
the subsidiaries’ tollway concession, we have performed 
the following audit procedures:
•			Checked	the	projected	traffic	volumes	used	in	the	
projection of future cash flows to traffic consultant’s 
report or historical trend;

Recoverability of the Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries (cont’d)
Management’s determination of the recoverable amount 
of the investments in these subsidiaries includes the 
assessment based on the projected future cash flows  
to be generated from the subsidiaries’ tollway 
concession and the sales of the subsidiaries’ unsold 
completed properties, property development costs and 
lands held for property development.
Based on the above, provision of impairment of 
RM113,499,000 has been made on the investments in 
these subsidiaries during the financial year.
We focused on this area because management’s 
determination of recoverable amounts requires 
significant judgements and estimates.
•			Checked	that	the	toll	rate	used	in	the	projection	of	
future cash flows are in accordance with the toll rates 
as stipulated in the concession agreement; 
•			Checked	that	the	tax	expenses	are	calculated	based	
on statutory tax rate, the repayment of borrowings and 
interests are based on terms of the loan agreements 
and the required capital expenditure and maintenance 
costs are based on approved budgets;   
•			Assessed	 the	 competency	 and	 objectivity	 of	 the	
traffic consultant by considering their professional 
qualifications and experience; and
•			Checked	 the	 reasonableness	 of	 the	 discount	 rate	
with assistance from auditors’ valuation experts 
by benchmarking to similar tollway concession 
companies.
With regards to the future cash flows to be generated 
from the sales of the subsidiaries’ unsold completed 
properties, property development costs and lands 
held for property development, we have performed the 
following audit procedures:
•			Checked	 that	 the	 selling	 prices	 of	 the	 unsold	
completed properties are reasonable by comparing 
to the market value of similar properties in the same 
vicinity or recent transacted prices;
•			For	property	development	costs	and	lands	held	for	
property development which management has relied 
on independent valuations to determine the net 
realisable value, we read the valuation reports issued 
by the independent valuers and discussed with the 
independent valuers to understand and evaluate 
the appropriateness of valuation methodology, 
assumptions and adjustments applied, which include 
types, conditions, ages and sizes of the properties. 
We also compared the values of the properties by the 
independent valuers to available information through 
market research; and 
•			Checked	that	the	tax	expenses	are	calculated	based

Based on the above procedures performed, we have not 
noted any material exceptions.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (cont’d) 
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ 
Report and Statement, Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control, Management Discussion and Analysis, 
Sustainability Statement, Chairman’s Statement and other sections of the 2024 Annual Report, but does not include the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we 
do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read 
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial 
Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible 
for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the 
Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the 
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s internal control.
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by the Directors.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on 
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s or on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. 
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the 
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we 
have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 52 to the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content  
of this report.
