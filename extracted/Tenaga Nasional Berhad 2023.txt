CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Shareholders, 
It gives me great pleasure to 
present to you T enaga Nasional 
Berhad’ s (TNB) Integrated Annual 
Report for the year 2023.
OVERVIEW
The	year	2023	marked	a	significant	turning	point	for	the	world	with	the	declaration	by	the	World	
Health	 Organization	 that	 COVID-19	 was	 no	 longer	 considered	 a	 global	 health	 emergency.	
While the announcement in May provided some optimism that it would be the end of  
pandemic-related challenges, it was tempered with an equal measure of uncertainty and 
pessimism	 given	 persistent	 inflation	 and	subsequent	 policy	 tightening.	 The	macroeconomic	
environment	was	also	impacted	by	the	ongoing	conflicts	in	Ukraine	and	the	Middle	East.	The	
escalation	of	geopolitical	tensions,	particularly	in	the	Middle	East,	had	put	markets	on	high	alert,	
contributing to the volatility of gas prices and adding layers of complexity to the global energy 
landscape	still	adjusting	to	the	aftermath	of	the	Russia-Ukraine	war.
These headwinds have weighed on sentiment and growth prospects, with subdued economic 
figures	being	recorded	in	2023	compared	to	the	robust	numbers	produced	during	the	immediate	
post-COVID	years.	Consequently,	the	International	Monetary	Fund	has	projected	global	Gross	
Domestic Product (GDP) growth to moderate to 3.0% in 2023, slowing from the 3.5% posted  
in 2022. 
Chairman
DA TO’ ABDUL RAZAK BIN ABDUL MAJID

FROM OUR LEADERSHIPSec 2
29
Domestically, Malaysia’s economy mirrored the global 
narrative of moderated growth, as it recorded a GDP 
growth of 3.7% in 2023 following the strong 8.7% 
rebound in 2022. Despite the resilient domestic demand,  
Malaysia’s	 growth	 was	 tempered	 by	 weak	 external	 
demand, in line with the slower global economy. 
On our part, TNB has continued to support Malaysia’s 
economic	 growth.	 Our	 efforts	 are	 aligned	 with	 the	
Madani	 Economy	 Framework	 that	 was	 introduced	 by	
the government in 2023, which aims to restructure  
Malaysia’s economy to elevate the nation towards  
becoming a leading Asian economy and to improve the 
quality of life of all Malaysians.
Meanwhile, Malaysia’s electricity demand growth, which 
generally	 reflects	 the	 country’s	 economic	 performance,	
posted a similar 3.8% year-on-year (Y oY) growth in 
Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, lower than the 6.1% 
YoY	growth	in	the	previous	 year.	Growth	was	backed	 by	 
healthy demand in both domestic and commercial 
segments, with Y oY growth of 5.5% and 9.9%,  
respectively,	reflecting	Malaysia’s	robust	domestic	demand.
OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
In 2023, our revenue saw an increase of 4.3%  
year-over-year , driven by a rise in electricity demand, but a 
decrease in EBITDA, which fell by 10.5% to RM18.6 billion, 
mainly due to a lower contribution from the generation 
business.	 In	 line	 with	 this,	 Profit	 After	 Tax	 decreased	
by 26.8% to RM2.6 billion, largely as a result of the  
volatility	of	global coal prices	 (accounted	from	stockpiled	
inventories).
Despite these challenges, we maintained our  
commitment to our dividend policy, which aims for a  
30% to 60% payout ratio based on the reported 
Consolidated	 Net	 Profit	 Attributable	 to	 Shareholders	
After Minority Interest, excluding extraordinary and  
non-recurring items. Thus, the Board is pleased to  
declare	a	final	single-tier	 dividend	of	28.0	sen	per	share.	
T ogether with our interim dividend of 18.0 sen per share 
paid on 17 October 2023, this brings our total dividend  
for	 the	 financial	 year	 2023	 to	 46.0	 sen	 per	 share,	 
matching the total dividend paid in FY2022. Consequently, 
the dividend payout ratio for FY2023 was higher 
at	 66.6%	 of	 profit	 after	 tax	 and	 minority	 interests,	
compared to 55.2% in FY2022, demonstrating our 
ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value.  
A T THE VANGUARD OF MALA YSIA ’S ENERGY 
TRANSITION
The	year	2023	entered	the	history	books	as	the	warmest	
year	on	record,	a	stark	reminder	of	the	impact	of	climate	
change exacerbated by the El Niño phenomenon. 
Domestically,	 we	 acknowledge	 that	 the	 nation	 was	
fortunate to be spared from the severe climate-related 
incidents	 that	affected	other	parts	of	the	world	in	2023.

REVENUE TOT AL DIVIDEND
In fact, we witnessed the government ushering in a watershed year in terms of  
elevating its climate action ambitions by launching the Malaysia Energy T ransition 
Outlook	(METO)	and	the	National	Energy	Transition	Roadmap	(NETR),	which	helped	to	
clarify Malaysia’s vision for the Energy T ransition.
While METO has detailed several possible future pathways for the development of a 
sustainable and cleaner energy system in Malaysia, the NETR focuses on actionable  
plans and the initiatives to gradually increase renewable energy (RE) to 70% of our 
country’s total generation capacity by 2050, with the ultimate goal of accomplishing  
net zero emissions as early as 2050. However , here it is also worth noting that 
conventional power plants, including currently operating coal plants, will continue to be 
required	in	Malaysia	at	this	stage,	especially	as	the	government	seeks	to	balance	energy	
security and reliability against energy generation cost considerations. In this context, 
the existing Imbalance Cost Pass- Through (ICPT) mechanism under the Incentive Based 
Regulation	(IBR)	framework	will	still	be	in	effect	to	cater	for	the	variability	of	fuel	costs. 
The NETR plays a crucial role in identifying and prioritising actions across the 
energy	 sector,	 with	 10	 flagship	 catalyst	 projects	 and	 initiatives	 grounded	 in	 six	
Energy	 Transition	 (ET)	 levers:	 Energy	 Efficiency	 (EE),	 RE,	 Hydrogen,	 Bioenergy,	 
Green Mobility, and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). TNB has been 
entrusted	 with	 leading	 three	 of	 NETR’s	 flagship	 projects:	 Large	 Scale	 Solar	 Parks,	 
Hybrid	 Hydro-Floating	 Solar	 (HHFS),	 and	 the	 Co-firing	 of	 Hydrogen	 and	 Ammonia.	
We support other levers through partnerships with the private and public sector . This 
highlights	the	collaborative	effort	needed	to	combat	climate	change,	pooling	expertise	
and resources from various sectors to achieve shared objectives.
I	am	heartened	 to	see	the	Management	 team	working	to	effect	change	and	leading	
the charge for the ET journey for both the nation and TNB. In 2023, we demonstrated 
thought leadership through the successful organisation of the Energy T ransition 
Conference	 in	August	 which	gathered	 local	and	international	 experts,	policymakers,	
and industry leaders to discuss and strategise on the future of the energy transition. 
The conference focused on three critical sectors impact by the ET , namely Power , 
Transport	and	cities,	with	Digitalisation	and	Data	Infrastructure	as	the	key	enablers.	The	
conference highlighted the opportunities and insights within each sector , serving as 
the ideal platform for intellectual and industry convergence. This collaboration across 
sectors has resulted in numerous agreements and partnerships aimed at accelerating 
the journey towards Energy T ransition.
Prime Minister YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim unveiled the National Energy Transition Roadmap 
(NETR) at the Energy Transition Conference 2023, which was hosted by TNB.

Even as TNB forges ahead with the NETR’s objectives, we will remain focused on strategic 
initiatives	 to	 enhance	 the	 flexibility	 and	 resilience	 of	 our	 transmission	 and	 distribution	 
networks,	 embrace	 more	 sustainable	 generation	 and	 elevate	 customer	 service	 levels.	 We	
are	also	forging	ahead	with	digitalisation	 initiatives,	 a	key	enabler	to	our	energy	transition	 
journey,	 to	 enhance	 efficiency,	 sustainability	 and	 innovation	 within	 the	 organisation.	 As	
digitalisation expands, there is a need to step up our cybersecurity measures to safeguard 
the electricity assets as well as to ensure safe, secure and reliable operations. Guided by our 
Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy T ransition Plan, we will continue to strongly support the 
country’s transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES
In building a Brighter Community, TNB focuses on community needs through our corporate 
social responsibility (CSR) programme that emphasises education, socioeconomic support, 
and environmental care. This year , we invested RM18.2 million in our CSR activities comprising 
the provision of educational opportunities, socioeconomic support and the upholding of  
our	environmental	commitments.	In	addition,	we	paid	zakat	amounting	to	RM40.4	million	in	
2023 across Peninsular Malaysia based on FY2022’s aggregate income, in which a portion of 
the	zakat	returned	to	us	in	the	form	of	wakalah	was	distributed	through	various	programmes	 
to ease the burden of targeted recipients.
Through Y ayasan Tenaga Nasional, we continue to sponsor students at the higher education 
level, both locally and abroad, in the form of scholarships and convertible loans. For 2023, we 
contributed more than RM70 million to sponsor 3,397 students for their higher education. 
We also support the government’s agenda to produce employable graduates and to grow  
Malaysia’s own talent in the power and utility industry via Universiti Tenaga Nasional, TNB 
Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. and TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. These institutions are 
preparing	the	future	workforce	for	the	Energy	Transition	through	relevant	training	and	capacity	
development, as well as conducting research & development into the latest technologies. 
In terms of socioeconomic support, we continue to carry out our Homes for the Needy  
programme, including Program Baiti Jannati, launched in 2007, and Projek Mesra Rakyat, which 
began in 2012. T ogether , these initiatives have provided new or upgraded homes to more 
than 1,000 families. This year , we also provided 2,500 primary students from low-income 
families with school supplies and uniforms through the Program Ceria ke Sekolah, in addition to  
financial	support	of	11	primary	schools	across	Peninsular	Malaysia	under	our	PINTAR	School	
Adoption programme. In continuing our decades-long commitment to developing the sport of 
hockey	in	Malaysia,	we	have	invested	RM5.6	million	to	our	TNB	Thunderbolts	programme	which	
aims	to	develop	and	nurture	high-potential	youth	hockey	players	from	all	over	the	nation.	
This	 year,	 our	 environmental	 efforts	 are	 further	 enhanced	 with	 the	 commitment	 to	 an	
investment of RM1.48 million to foster eco-friendly practices, biodiversity conservation and 
community	 involvement	 in	 environmental	 stewardship.	 Our	 flagship	 project,	 MY	 Brighter	
Green	programme,	kicked	off	in	September	2023	in	conjunction	with	TNB’s	74th anniversary 
and has seen a total of 78,100 trees planted across various locations throughout Malaysia. 
Additionally,	TNB	has	electrified	 108	vehicles	 within	its	fleet,	aligning	 with	its	objective	 to	 
replace	30%	of	its	vehicles	with	electric	vehicles	(EVs)	by	2030,	showcasing	a	tangible	shift	
towards a more sustainable corporate transport policy. We are also expanding the participation 
of local companies and vendors in our energy transition initiatives through various vendor 
engagement and development programmes. The ongoing Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
project is a great testament where we managed to develop a pool of capable local vendors, 
manufactures and installers to realise the target of smart meter installations nationwide  
while	contributing	to	job	creation	and	skill	development	for	the	nation.
GOVERNANCE
In	2023,	Tenaga	Nasional	Berhad	(TNB)	made	significant	strides	in	enhancing	its	governance	
structures, with a pronounced emphasis on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) 
principles.	I	recognise	Management’s	efforts	in	bolstering	governance,	especially	in	the	ESG	
context as it underscores TNB’s commitment to sustainability and responsible corporate 
conduct,	aligning	with	expectations	from	stakeholders.
CHAIRMAN’S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
At TNB, we recognise that the Energy T ransition 
(ET) journey is a shared responsibility and would 
be impossible to achieve on the strength of just  
one company. With the growing sense of 
urgency to push ahead with this agenda, it 
is heartening to note that others are also 
acknowledging	 this	 and	 reaching	 out	 to	
collaborate in order to achieve this mutually 
beneficial	 goal.	 With	 this	 as	 the	 backdrop,	
TNB has continued to forge partnerships with 
like-minded	 organisations	 across	 our	 entire	
value chain, from our generation business, 
transmission	 and	 distribution	 network	 as	 well	
as	retail	to	benefit	our	customers.	We	have	also	
been particularly interested in nurturing nascent 
green technologies that hold great potential to 
boost the ET journey, as we recognise that these 
technologies will require incubation before 
becoming commercially viable. 
Thus, in 2023, we have collaborated with 
numerous partners, including regional utilities, 
multi-nationals and some of our biggest  
Malaysian conglomerates to explore 
decarbonisation, interconnection, renewable 
energy	 solutions,	 electrification	 of	 the	
transportation sector and green technologies. 
We believe that this pathway of forging 
partnerships will continue to be a critical  
enabler to future-proof our business as we 
continue implementing our Reimagining TNB 
strategy and Energy T ransition plan.
In addition, we will continue to strongly support 
initiatives that will elevate the energy literacy 
of our citizens as they too are important 
stakeholders.	A	better	understanding	of	energy	
systems and the various impacts of energy 
transition	will	enable	decision	makers	to	make	
more informed decisions, which will hopefully 
lead to a brighter future for our planet.
Partnerships for Success

We also formed a new Sustainability Division, headed by the Chief 
Sustainability	 Officer,	 with	 the	 key	 roles	 to	 ensure	 the	 effective	 
deployment of our sustainability strategies, thus helping us to meet our 
targets and strengthening sustainability governance across the Group.
OUTLOOK
Looking	 ahead	 for	 Malaysia,	 economic	 growth	 is	 expected	 to	 track	 
upwards to 4-5% in 2024, from the 3.7% recorded in 2023, driven by the 
recovery in exports and resilient domestic expenditure, according to 
Bank	Negara	Malaysia.	Growth	will	be	supported	by	a	solid	labour	market,	
enhanced household spending and improvements in tourist arrivals. In 
addition, sustained investment activities propelled by ongoing multi-year 
projects in both the private and public sectors, as well as the execution of 
catalytic initiatives under national master plans provides further upside. 
Fuel prices are also expected to ease in 2024. 
We see further upside for TNB going forward especially with the 
government’s	robust	efforts	to	drive	the	decarbonisation	 agenda.	With	
policies	supporting	the	expanding	adoption	of	EVs	and	EV	infrastructure,	
EV	 sales	 are	 expected	 to	 more	 than	 double	 in	 2024,	 according	 to	 
forecasts made by the Malaysian Automotive Association. The other 
catalyst is Malaysia’s growing prominence as a preferred destination for 
data centres which will drive the demand for renewable energy (RE). T o 
support this, TNB has established the Green Lane Pathway programme  
to streamline the on-boarding process for data centres, expedite 
approvals and facilitate the smooth setting up of data centres in Malaysia. 
In addition, the government’s plan to establish a regional green energy 
exchange bodes well for increased activity in RE export deals, in which  
we	expect	to	be	a	key	player.
We	take	cognisance	of	the	latest	development	in	the	Sabah	electricity	
supply industry in which, the Sabah state government through the 
Energy	Commission	of	Sabah	(ECoS)	has	officially	taken	over	regulatory	 
authority of the state’s electricity supply in January 2024. TNB will 
continue to support the government through the 7-year transformation 
programme	 of	 Sabah	 Electricity	 Sdn.	 Bhd.	 into	becoming	 a	financially	
viable and sustainable utility, while simultaneously improving the state’s 
power supply security and reliability.
For	 TNB,	 it	 will	 be	 a	 critical	 time	 as	 we	 enter	 the	 final	 year	 of	
Regulatory	 Period	 3.	 I	 am	 confident	 that	 the	 Management	 team	 will	
put forward a responsible and prudent proposal for our submission 
for the RP4 which spans 2025-2027. In line with the Government’s 
effort	 to	 rationalise	 various	 subsidies,	 coupled	 with	 the	 increase	 of	 
RE	 penetration	 in	 the	 system,	 TNB	 is	 also	 working	 closely	 with	 the	 
Ministry of Energy T ransition and Water T ransformation and the  
Energy	 Commission	 towards	 a	 more	 cost-reflective	 electricity	 tariff	 
that features a targeted subsidy mechanism.
As we move forward, TNB remains steadfast in its journey towards  
achieving the ambitious goals outlined in our revised Reimagining TNB 
2.0 strategy, guided by our purpose to brighten lives through innovative 
and sustainable energy solutions towards a better world. Our proactive 
engagement in Malaysia’s energy transition, strategic investments in 
infrastructure, and unwavering commitment to sustainability and customer 
satisfaction have positioned us well to navigate the challenges ahead.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
It is my profound honour to extend my deepest gratitude to the Board of 
Directors for their unwavering support, invaluable wisdom, and strategic 
counsel throughout a year that was both challenging and continuously 
evolving. Their guidance has been instrumental in steering TNB towards its

the	Board,	as	he	takes	over	the	helm	effective	1	March	2024	and	works	
towards bringing TNB forward to a brighter future. 
Our	 Management	 Team	 deserves	 special	 acknowledgment	 as	 well	
for	 their	 efforts,	 supported	 tirelessly	 by	 our	 employees,	 who	 have	
shown	remarkable	resilience	 and	commitment,	allowing	us	to	continue	
brightening	the	lives	of	the	rakyat	every	day.	I	am	immensely	proud	of	our	
Warga	TNB	for	their	dedication	and	hard	work,	which	are	fundamental	to	
our success.
I	wish	to	express	my	heartfelt	appreciation	to	our	stakeholders,	including

CEO’S STRA TEGIC & OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
President/Chief	Executive	Officer
DA TUK IR. MEGA T JALALUDDIN BIN MEGA T HASSAN
Dear Valued Shareholders of T enaga Nasional 
Berhad:
2023 was an exciting year for Malaysia as the 
nation made a firm commitment to accelerate a 
responsible Energy T ransition with TNB at the 
forefront in driving the country’ s aspiration to 
achieve Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050. We 
at TNB are resolute in supporting the growth of 
the nation by creating further value for all our 
stakeholders by leveraging new opportunities 
and realise the nation’ s sustainability ambitions 
for a better and brighter future.
The increase in electricity demand directly contributed to TNB’s  
top-line growth of 4.3% YOY in 2023, with revenue growing to RM53.07 
billion.	However,	we	recorded	lower	EBITDA	and	profit	after	tax	(PAT)	of	 
RM18.6 billion and RM2.6 billion respectively, mainly due to the 
negative	fuel	margin.	Our	liquidity	and	cashflow	position	have	improved	 
significantly	 in	 2023	 as	 we	 recorded	 a	 56%	 reduction	 in	 receivables,	 
mainly through consistent cost recovery of Imbalance Cost Pass- Through 
(ICPT)	as	well	as	efforts	made	by	TNB	to	improve	our	collection	rate.
Operational excellence remains a cornerstone of our strategy, and we 
strive to ensure our infrastructure assets remain robust and available to 
serve our customers. We recorded a T ransmission System Minutes of  
0.48 minutes, while our Distribution System Average Interruption  
Duration Index (SAIDI) was 46.1 - which puts us on par with other 
global utilities. Our power plants recorded a solid 83.3% availability 
factor	throughout	2023,	a	testament	to	the	efforts	of	our	employees	in	 
upholding world-class standards of operational excellence in the  
operation and maintenance of our electricity supply infrastructure.
With regards to the safety and well-being of our employees and  
contractors, our Loss Time Injury Frequency (L TIF) was 0.74, a slight 
improvement from the 0.82 recorded in 2022. In 2023, we recorded the 
unfortunate loss of four lives - three employees and one contractor . We 
understand	the	gravity	of	the	situation	and	are	taking	all	the	necessary	
preventive measures to ensure the safety of everyone with the 
enforcement of Tenaga Safety Culture and Life Saving Rules.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
Malaysia’s economy continue its growth trajectory in 2023 at a moderated 
pace of 3.7% compared to the robust 8.7% in 2022. The economic 
expansion	 was	 similarly	 reflected	 in	 the	 rise	 of	 Malaysia’s	 electricity	
demand of 3.8% year-on-year (YOY) in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.

Our aspiration has always been clear: to lead as a provider of sustainable energy solutions 
in Malaysia and expand our impact internationally. We have made substantive progress 
across each strategic pillar , ensuring that our progress aligns with the nation’s mission  
as	outlined	 within	key	policy	documents	 like	the	National	 Energy	Transition	Roadmap	
(NETR). The full details of our strategic progress can be found in the Achieving our  
Strategic Ambitions section of this Integrated Report.
Our	leadership	position	as	the	key	driver	in	Energy	Transition	was	further	entrenched	
by the outcomes of the inaugural Energy T ransition Conference 2023. The conference 
highlighted	 our	 thought	 leadership	 capabilities	 and	 unlocked	 a	 slew	 of	 business	
opportunities, initiatives and collaborations that have propelled Malaysia’s Energy  
Transition	(ET)	journey	forward	significantly.
CEO’S STRA TEGIC & OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
On	the	customer	front,	our	relentless	 pursuit	of	excellence	 has	paid	off,	and	in	2023,	 
we achieved the highest recorded Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) score of 88%. This 
was in tandem with our excellent Customer Experience Index (CEI) scores of over 90% 
across all our physical and digital touchpoints. These are truly historic achievements  
for TNB, and we are proud to continue delivering exceptional service to our customers. 
These successes are driven by continuous enhancements in our communications, 
our proactive approach in issue resolution, and robust digitalisation initiatives that  
significantly	elevate	the	customer	experience.
STRA TEGY
Building upon the foundational vision of the Reimagining TNB strategy, our approach

DELIVER CLEAN GENERA TION
In the context of our domestic renewable 
energy (RE) capacity, we have continued to  
grow from strength to strength in the year  
under review. Domestically, we have seen 
increased generation at TNB Sepang, Selangor , 
which provided an uplift to earnings. We 
are happy to report that we received the  
Commercial Operations Date (COD) earlier 
than	 expected	 for	 the	 TNB	 Bukit	 Selambau	 
Solar Dua asset under LSS4, which added 
75MWp of operational solar asset at the end 
of 2023. More positive news were recorded 
when we successfully secured solar asset 
development rights amounting to 135MWp 
through the Corporate Green Power 
Programme (CGPP) under the New Enhanced 
Dispatch	 Arrangement	 framework,	 providing	
more revenue upside going forward.
As part of Malaysia’s NETR, TNB is  
spearheading	 three	 key	 large-scale	 RE	
and clean technology initiatives, namely  
Centralised	 Large-Scale	 Solar	 (LSS)	 parks,	
Hybrid Hydro Floating Solar (HHFS), and 
hydrogen	 and	 ammonia	 co-firing	 projects.	
Collectively, these initiatives have the  
capability to deliver over 3,000MW of renewable 
energy capacity by 2040 of which around 
2,500MW	are	from	HHFS	technology,	while	an	additional	500MW	are	sourced	from	five	different	 
LSS	 parks.	 Under	 the	 HHFS,	we	 plan	 to	install	 up	 to	230MW	 capacity	 at	 the	 Temenggor	 and	
Chenderoh	hydro	plants	by	2025.	In	Perak,	we	have	embarked	on	exploring	a	potential	partnership	
to develop a 100MW ground-mounted solar project. These projects are integral to TNB’s ET Plan  
and	 are	 expected	 to	 generate	 significant	 RE	 capacity,	 foster	 greater	 participation	 in	 the	 
development of the RE sector and contribute to the nation’s goal of accelerating decarbonisation.  
In our mission towards decarbonising conventional thermal plants in Malaysia, we recognise that  
one	 of	 the	 pathways	 identified	 is	 through	 Carbon	 Capture	 &	 Storage	 (CCS).	 As	 a	 key	 ET	
technology,	 CCS	 holds	 significant	 potential	 in	 decarbonising	 our	 generation	 capacity.	 Mindful	
of the technical and commercial challenges to achieve meaningful scale, we have entered  
into collaborations with leading domestic and international companies to explore the  
implementation	 of	CCS	technology	in	our	thermal	plants.	A	key	component	of	the	collaboration	
includes	 knowledge	 transfer	 with	 our	engineers	 receiving	 specialised	 training	 to	enhance	 their	
technical capabilities. 
To	further	support	our	decarbonisation	 efforts,	we	are	actively	 repowering	 existing	plants	with	
cleaner fuels, integrating green technology, and exploring the possibility of early retirement for  
coal	plants	domestically	and	internationally	to	ensure	our	operations	are	both	efficient	and	reduce	
our environmental footprint. In 2023, we completed the disposal of our power generation assets 
in India, which included 1,650MW of coal generation. This divestment aligns with our intention to 
gradually reduce our coal generation capacity.
In	2023,	we	successfully	 made	inroads	into	the	Australian	RE	market	through	the	acquisition	 of	 
Spark	 Renewables	 Australia,	 which	 has	 around	 120.5MWp	 of	 operational	 solar	 assets	 and	 
4.2GW of RE pipeline. We expanded our RE footprint in Europe, namely in the Republic of 
Ireland, which includes the acquisition of operational solar assets with 276MWp capacity, This  
underscores	our	commitment	to	growing	our	international	 RE	assets,	enabling	us	to	bring	back	
technologies	and	implement	new	business	models	that	benefit	Malaysia.
Our approach to transforming 
the energy generation landscape 
is three-fold: significantly 
increasing our renewable energy 
capacity, improving our carbon 
management, and a gradual 
reduction of our coal generation 
capacity. We own and operate 
198 powers plants with an 
installed capacity of 16,283MW 
and we are cognisant of the 
need for us to decarbonise our 
generation fleet in a sustainable 
and responsible manner . 
CEO’S STRA TEGIC & OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
Renewable energy and low-carbon energy sources are shaping the future, driven by a commitment to 
decarbonisation and climate action.

DEVELOP THE ENERGY TRANSITION NETWORK
At TNB, we strongly believe that 
there is no transition without 
transmission. This motivates 
us in building and maintaining 
intelligent, resilient and flexible 
electricity grids that enable 
the faster adoption of more RE 
sources.
CEO’S STRA TEGIC & OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
To	enhance	 automated	 network	 control	 and	 fast	 supply	 restoration,	 we	 continued	 the	 rollout	
of Distribution Automation (DA). Approximately 4,000 substations were successfully installed 
and commissioned with DA, covering about 2.6 million customers. This brings our total to  
28,340 distribution substations, accounting for 34% of total distribution stations in Peninsular 
Malaysia.	For	our	transmission	network,	we	enhanced	our	Advanced	Automatic	Fault	Analysis	(AFA)	
system to improve response and restoration time during outages.
Another	 aspect	 of	 developing	 the	 ET	 network	 is	 cross-border	 interconnections	 as	 they	 help	
in achieving ASEAN’s ET and decarbonisation targets. At TNB, we are constantly exploring 
opportunities to expand our regional interconnections through Memorandums of Understanding 
(MOUs) with ASEAN neighbours such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. These agreements  
are strategic stepping stones towards the development of interconnection projects that are 
expected	to	strengthen	the	ASEAN	power	grid.	A	key	milestone	was	achieved	with	the	completion	
of a joint feasibility study with EGA T Thailand in 2023, paving the way forward for the expansion of 
the interconnection between Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand.
As	 a	 responsible	 grid	 owner,	 TNB	 carefully	 tracks	 and	 analyses	 electricity	 demands	 in	
anticipation of new and emerging economic growth in the country. In recent years, we have 
seen	 a	 significant	 surge	 in	 demand	 from	 hyperscale	 co-location	 data	 centres	 in	 Malaysia.	
In	 response	 to	 this	 growing	 market,	 we	 introduced	 the	 Green	 Lane	 Pathway	 in	 2023	 to	 
fast-track	 the	 on-boarding	 process	 and	 significantly	 reduce	 the	 time	 taken	 for	 the	 supply	 
connection of electricity to data centres. As of April 2024, we have managed to complete the  
power supply connection to 11 data centres totaling 1,156MW.
In	anticipation	 of	increasing	 energy	 demands	 in	the	future,	 we	identified	 hydrogen	and	energy	
storage	 as	 promising	 domains	 to	 be	 explored.	 Preliminary	 efforts	 to	 explore	 the	 adoption	 of	
these technologies in Malaysia were made such as advancing the studies for hydrogen business 
development and completing a feasibility study of potential sites for a large-scale battery energy 
storage	system	(BESS)	flagship	project	in	Malaysia	by	our	Grid	division.
We	 have	 been	 making	 steady	 strides	 in	 
Develop	 the	 Energy	 Transition	 Network.	 In	 
2023 we expanded and upgraded our 
transmission	 and	 distribution	 network	 via	 a	
CAPEX investment of RM7.3 billion.
The investment includes building a 
smart grid and deploying smart meters 
under the national Advanced Metering 
Infrastructure (AMI) programme. We installed  
873,740 more smart meters, surpassing 
our target of 600,000 units for 2023. This 
outstanding achievement brings the total to 
over 3.5 million smart meters across the Klang 
Valley,	Melaka,	Kedah,	Johor,	and	Penang.
DYNAMIC ENERGY SOLUTIONS
TNB continues to encourage our customers to be engaged in 
our collective journey towards a sustainable energy future. We 
have stayed on course with our initiatives to elevate customer 
engagement and satisfaction, widened the use of rooftop solar 
panels	nationwide	 and	invested	significant	 resources	 to	boost	
the	electrification	of	Malaysia’s	transport	sector.
At TNB, our journey to empower customers 
and deliver exceptional services continues 
to evolve, reflecting our enduring 
commitment to create relevant value that 
are appreciated by our customers, who are 
slowly embracing a smarter and greener 
lifestyle.
TNB is committed to enhancing customer experiences through innovative solutions, 
engagement and value creation for all stakeholders.

CEO’S STRA TEGIC & OPERA TIONAL REVIEW
TNB remains at the forefront of the 
electrification	 of	 the	 transportation	 sector,	
which continues to grow at a rapid pace here in  
Malaysia and regionally. As of end-2023, the number 
of	 Electric	 Vehicles	 (EVs)	 on	 the	 road	 jumped	 to	 
10,159 units from 2,631 in 2022, while the 
total	 number	 of	 Direct	 Current	 (DC)	 fast	 EV	
charge points has increased to 503, bringing 
the total number of charge points to 2,288 
as  of  April  2024.	To	meet	 this	 growing	 demand,	
we	 have	 significantly	 expanded	 the	 TNB	 Electron	
charging	 network	 to	32	 charge	 points	 at	 strategic	 
locations across Peninsular Malaysia. These include 
PLUS/LPT2 highways, commercial buildings, and 
TNB	Premises,	providing	greater	convenience	for	EV	
owners. 
Beyond our borders, we have signed a Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) with Chargeplus (Charge+) 
to	facilitate	 cross-border	 EV	 charge	 points	 across	
Malaysia and Singapore. This MOU forms the 
foundation to develop a seamless cross-border 
network	of	30,000	charge	points	by	2030	spanning	
5,000km	 of	 highways	 across	 Singapore,	 Malaysia,	
Thailand,	Cambodia	and	Vietnam. 	
Additionally, TNB is focused in engaging our customers to understand the means of  
managing their energy consumption better . T o accomplish this objective, we elevated the 
Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) to a national-level initiative with oversight 
by the Ministry of Energy T ransition and Water T ransformation (PETRA). MELP aims to 
support	the	national	ET	agenda	by	improving	the	energy	literacy	of	Malaysians.	A	significant	 
milestone for MELP was reached in 2023 when Universiti Tenaga Nasional and Universiti 
Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) decided to incorporate energy literacy modules into their 
curriculum. Both tertiary institutions have agreed to enhance energy literacy through 
programmes, initiatives, publications, and research.
In	the	rooftop	solar	PV	space,	GSPARX	continues	to	play	a	significant	role	in	transforming	 
TNB’s customers into prosumers. By the end of 2023, GSPARX secured a cumulative 340MWp 
of solar capacity, including a nationwide project involving AEON shopping centres and 
AEON	BiG	supermarkets	with	a	total	capacity	of	78MWp.	Meanwhile,	TNBX,	a	wholly-owned	
subsidiary of TNB, focuses on sustainable energy solutions. It launched several innovations 
such	as	SuriaShield	residential	solar	PV	insurance	and	the	Virtual	Energy	Manager	solution	to	
assist commercial and industrial customers in managing their electricity usage.
Digitalisation	 has	been	a	key	lever	in	helping	us	deliver	exceptional	 customer	experience,	
particularly through the wider adoption and greater functionality of the award-winning  
myTNB app. myTNB currently has over has 6.7 million subscribers with features aimed 
at promoting customer empowerment and sustainable practices. The features we have 
introduced continue to delight our customers and as proof of its user-friendliness and 
relevance, it was recognised by a leading technology publication, PC.com for being the Best 
Public Utility App in 2023.
In 2023, we continue to see our Malaysian government’s steadfast support for the Incentive 
Based	Regulation	 (IBR)	framework,	which	has	been	governing	our	electricity	 sector	since	2014.	 
We recovered about RM16 billion of fuel costs via the Imbalance Cost Pass- Through (ICPT) 
mechanism,	which	helped	improve	our	financial	liquidity.
As	a	key	enabler	of	Malaysia’s	ET	journey,	TNB	has	been	an	active	participant	at	global	meetings	
such as COP28 and organising our own Energy T ransition Conference. The government’s 
bullish stance on the ET is evident with the multitude of supportive policy announcements and  
blueprints launched over the past two years, including the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint  
2021-2030, National Energy Policy 2022-2040, Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint 2021-2030,  
New	Industrial	Master	Plan	2030,	the	Malaysian	Energy	Transition	Outlook	and	the	NETR.	This	is	in	
addition to the enhancement of existing programmes such as increased quotas for the Corporate 
DRIVE REGULA TORY EVOLUTION
Green Power Programme (CGPP) and the Net 
Energy Metering (NEM) scheme. 
TNB has collaborated with relevant  
stakeholders	 to	 drive	 the	 ET	 journey.	 For	
instance, we collaborate with the Zero  
Emissions	 Vehicle	 Association	 (ZEVA)	 which	
actively advocates for the development of 
related legislation, policies, and standards 
for	 electric	 vehicles	 (EVs).	 Furthermore,	 we	
continue to be involved in the MyPOWER-led 
MESI (Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry) 
study, ensuring that we are contributing to 
a future-proof MESI, capable of addressing 
the challenges of decarbonisation while  
maintaining energy security, equity, and 
sustainability. The results of the study, which  
was completed in 2022, provided valuable 
insights and opportunities for further 
discussion.
In addressing the future of the electricity industry within Malaysia, 
TNB is strategically navigating the evolving regulatory and 
policy landscape to ensure the best outcomes for its business, 
stakeholders, and the broader community. It is here that we 
recognise the symbiotic relationship between government  
support, TNB’ s proactive measures, and the collective move 
towards a sustainable energy transition.

As Malaysia steers into 2024, it is poised to be an exciting year with TNB at the forefront  
of the nation’s ET journey. We are directing greater focus to our domestic businesses 
and	 investments	 in	 support	 of	 key	 initiatives	 to	 help	 achieve	 the	 goals	 outlined	 
under the NETR.
In	 line	 with	 this,	 we	 are	 preparing	 to	participate	 in	 the	 LSS	 Programme’s	fifth	 cycle	
(LSS5) which will see an expanded quota of up to 2GW, including a novel category for 
floating	solar	projects.	Complementing	this	will	be	the	Low	Carbon	Energy	Generation	 
Programme (LCEGP) with a 400MW quota, which opens up opportunities for other  
low-carbon power generation, such as small hydro, biogas, biomass, and hydrogen. 
In terms of addressing the intermittency issues of RE sources, we are planning to initiate 
Malaysia’s	first	utility-scale	Battery	Energy	Storage	System	(BESS)	project	with	400MWh	
capacity. This pilot project, spearheaded by TNB and overseen by the Energy Commission, 
represents	 a	 pioneering	 step	 in	 enhancing	 grid	 stability	 and	 reliability,	 marking	 a	 
significant	 milestone	 in	 Malaysia’s	 journey	 towards	 a	 sustainable	 energy	 future.	 
Regionally,	 we	 look	 forward	 to	 our	 collaboration	 with	 Laos’	 utility	 service	 provider,	
Electricite du Lao (EDL), which opens new possibilities for cross-border electricity trade 
within ASEAN. 
On the regulatory front, as we move closer to the Regulatory Period 4 (RP4) 2025-2027, 
TNB’s overarching goal is to continue supporting our customers’ energy needs and 
facilitating Malaysia’s Energy T ransition. In this context, TNB is stepping up once again 
with	 significant	 CAPEX	to	maintain	 security	 of	supply,	meet	 the	projected	 electricity	
demand growth of 1.6-4.3% and facilitate the Energy T ransition. We aim to allocate a 
larger proportion of the CAPEX (compared to the previous year) for ET -related spending. 
Regarding	the	tariff	structure,	TNB	is	supportive	of	tariff	reforms	that	ensure	electricity	
costs	are	appropriately	reflected	on	a	fair	and	equitable	basis,	delivering	positive	results	
for the industry over the long term.
While 2023 was the year when ET really got started in Malaysia, 2024 and 
beyond are when we execute in earnest the exciting programmes within  
NETR.	Indeed,	TNB	is	perfectly	primed	to	benefit	from	all	the	opportunities	offered	by	
NETR for we are fully committed to ensuring Malaysia achieves its ambitions. With TNB 
leading	the	charge,	we	are	confident	that	we	can	facilitate	the	nation	to	achieving	its	
energy transition goals, fostering a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future for all.

ACHIEVING OUR STRA TEGIC AMBITIONS
OVERVIEW 
In 2023, TNB produced a total of 95,203GWh of electricity, of which 79,355GWh was  
generated from coal and gas sources and 7,903GWh from renewable energy sources. 
T otal renewable energy (RE) made up 8.3% of the total electricity sent out in 2023, a slight  
decrease from the 8.7% in 2022.
In alignment with our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy T ransition plan, we have  
continued	to	uphold	the	operational	excellence	of	our	conventional	and	RE	generation	fleet,	
explored new collaborations to decarbonise our thermal plants in Malaysia and forged ahead 
with acquiring and developing new RE assets. 
DOMESTIC GENERA TION BUSINESS UPDA TE
Operational Performance Update 
In 2023, TNB Power Generation Sdn. Bhd. power plant availability factor in Peninsular  
Malaysia was 83.3%, a slight improvement from the 83.2% recorded in 2022. The improvement 
was mainly contributed by the continual optimisation of the planned outages at our thermal 
plants. 
The	plant	availability	factor	was	significantly	affected	after	one	of	our	major	power	plants,	the	
TNB	Janamanjung	 1GW	coal-fired	plant,	experienced	 an	unexpected	 outage	in	December	
2023. Remedial actions are already underway, and we will be striving to rectify this issue as  
early as possible to resume plant operation. Prior to this, our plant availability factor had 
improved by 1.5% quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2023, due to lower unplanned outages during the 
period, which contributed to a 43.6% quarter-on-quarter improvement in capacity payment. 
Our measures to reduce boiler tube failures and minimise planned outages in 2023 also paid  
off,	leading	 to	an	 improved	 plant	 Equivalent	 Unplanned	 Outage	 Factor	(EUOF)	 of	 6.58%	
(FY2022: 7.37%).
Our pursuit of plant operational excellence has led to TNB Genco winning several awards, 
including: 
The future energy landscape is 
set to be shaped by renewable and

Decarbonising Our Conventional Thermal Plants
At TNB, we recognise that conventional thermal plants will continue to 
play	an	important	role	in	Malaysia	in	providing	a	reliable	and	affordable	 
base	 load.	 Nevertheless,	 our	 efforts	 to	 decarbonise	 our	 plants	 will	 
continue at a steady pace as outlined in our own ET plan and to support 
the	nation’s	efforts	to	achieve	Net	Zero	by	2050.	In	this	context,	this	
year , we have established important collaborations with companies  
such as PETRONAS and T oshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation  
(T oshiba EES) to explore the implementation of Carbon Capture & Storage 
(CCS) solutions in our thermal plants.
With PETRONAS, our collaboration will explore the viability of storing 
captured	 carbon	 from	TNB	sites	 in	PETRONAS	oil	fields,	whereas	 the	
partnership with T oshiba EES is aimed at accelerating the application of 
carbon capture technology in our thermal plants. The agreement with 
T oshiba EES will also see our engineers receiving specialised training to 
support the delivery and operation of CCS equipment. 
Growing Our RE Assets
In 2023, we continued our steadfast pursuit of more RE generation  
capacity in Malaysia and internationally inline with our push for RE to 
comprise 40% of our total capacity mix by 2025.
TNB	Bukit	Selambau	Solar	Dua,	an	LSS	project	under	the	fourth	bidding	
cycle (LSS4) managed to achieve earlier Commercial Operations Date 
(COD) in December 2023. This is another milestone for TNB that  
adds another 75MWp solar generation capacity in Malaysia and 
demonstrates our strong capability in developing, operating, and 
maintaining LSS power plants.
We have also successfully secured development rights for 135MWp of 
solar projects through the Corporate Green Power Programme, under 
the	New	Enhanced	Dispatch	Arrangement	framework.	This	will	boost	not	
just our revenue and generation capacity in green energy locally but will  
further demonstrate our commitment to supporting green energy 
requirement by local and international partners in Malaysia directly.
In support of the National Energy T ransition Roadmap (NETR), one of 
TNB’s	flagship	initiatives	is	the	Centralised	(LSS)	parks	project,	which	will	
encompass	five	sites,	each	with	a	potential	capacity	of	around	100MW.	
This initiative fosters collaboration with state economic development 
bodies, cooperatives, and small and medium-sized enterprises with aims 
to galvanise local involvement in RE projects, contributing to the sector’s 
holistic growth across the value chain. 
We	also	kick	started	our	domestic	 floating	solar	plant	investments	 by	
issuing	a	tender	for	developers	to	build	a	30MW	floating	solar	plant	at	the	
Chenderoh	Reservoir	on	the	Perak	River.	This	will	be	closely	followed	in	the	
future by similar plants at our Temenggor and Kenyir hydro reservoirs.

ACHIEVING OUR STRA TEGIC AMBITIONS
OUTLOOK
Looking	 ahead,	 TNB	will	 reinforce	 our	commitment	 to	sustainability	
and operational excellence. We are committed to maintaining the 
operational	 excellence	 of	our	generation	 fleet,	 with	an	emphasis	 on	
identifying and implementing strategies to reduce operating costs 
further.	A	significant	 focus	remains	on	the	accelerated	retirement	 of	
coal plants, transitioning towards cleaner and more sustainable energy 
sources	in	line	with	our	efforts	to	reduce	carbon	emissions.	In	addition,	
we	are	making	steady	progress	on	the	300MW	Nenggiri	hydroelectric	
power project, anticipated to commence commercial operations by 
2027,	which	aligns	with	our	goal	to	enhance	our	RE	capacity	significantly.	
Aligning with NETR and the government’s aspiration for increased 
domestic investments, we will be recalibrating our strategy to prioritise 
investments in Malaysia. This involves acquiring operational and/or  
late-stage RE assets to bolster TNB’s expertise in the RE sector 
and spearhead the energy transition. We are also set to expedite 
the development of early-stage projects, transforming them into 
operational assets within the stipulated budget and timeline. 
On the international front, TNB is committed to grow its presence 
through both our international RE platforms and will continue to  
provide support, especially in Australia, where the current focus is 
on converting development pipelines into operational assets, which 
may involve tender participation. This strategy will leverage TNB’s  
extensive experience in developing power projects in both international 
and	domestic	markets,	along	with	knowledge	and	technology	transfer	
within the TNB Group. Our RE capability is further demonstrated 
by a capable team in the UK handling various RE technologies as 
well	 as	 managing	 different	 stages	 of	 RE	 projects	 i.e.,	 construction,	
development, operations, and maintenance.
In addition, TNB’s international RE platforms are also exploring 
alternative	revenue	mechanisms,	such	as	the	Contract-for-Difference	
scheme, corporate Power Purchase Agreements and Battery Energy 
Storage System based opportunities. These initiatives, introduced 
through recent acquisitions, promise to diversify income sources 
while	 reinforcing	 the	 international	 assets’	 financial	 resilience	 thus	
strengthening TNB’s transition towards renewable energy and 
contributing to our National Net Zero commitments. 
We	have	initiated	the	construction	of	two	greenfield	solar	power	plants	
with a total capacity of 102MWp in UK with COD anticipated in 2024. 
These projects will contribute steadily to our international RE platform 
as it will be under a 15-year subsidy scheme. Our European RE business 
also reached another milestone with its expansion into Ireland through 
the acquisition of a 276MWp operational solar power plant, in line with  
our international growth strategy to grow towards 1GW of operational  
and under-construction assets.
In 2023, we made our maiden footprint into Oceania - Australia. Australia 
has	 a	 robust	 RE	 landscape,	 marked	 by	 strong	 regulatory	 frameworks	
and	 well-established	 ecosystem.	 Acquiring	 Spark	 Renewables	 is	 a	
strategic	step	in	TNB’s	growth	strategy,	offering	 immediate	 access	to	
operational assets and a promising pipeline. This accelerates our shift 
towards	greenfield	development,	reducing	costs	and	optimising	resource	
deployment.	 This	 acquisition	 of	 100%	 interest	 in	 Spark	 Renewables	
platform comprises a fully operational solar power plant of 120.5MWp 
together with sizable early-stages development pipeline in various 
technology	including	solar	and	wind.	In	addition,	Spark	Renewables	has	an	
existing strong management team with highly experienced individuals in 
the	RE	industry	with	a	proven	track	record	in	pipeline	development.
The	 international	 platforms	 will	 contribute	 significantly	 to	 TNB’s	Net	
Zero	aspiration	by	facilitating	knowledge	exchange,	advancing	expertise	
in	renewable	technologies,	enabling	technology	uptake,	and	promoting	
international collaboration to accelerate the country’s sustainable energy 
transition.
INTERNA TIONAL GENERA TION BUSINESS UPDA TE
On the international front, TNB International Sdn. Bhd. (TNBI), our 
platform for capturing global RE opportunities registered a higher full 
year performance from its onshore wind portfolio of around 100MWp in 
the United Kingdom (UK), which was acquired in 2022. In addition, overall 
power price was also favourable in 2023 in the UK region. However , this  
was	 offset	 by	 a	non-cash	 impairment	 of	 goodwill	 for	our	 investment	
in	 Vantage	 Solar	 UK	 Ltd.	 and	 Blyth	 Offshore	 Demonstrator	 Ltd.	 The	
impairment	 is	an	adjustment	 to	reflect	the	softer	power	prices	in	the	
future	and	interest	rate	hike	in	the	region,	with	no	discount	to	the	power	
plant performance. 
TNB’s Net Zero goal advances through international RE platforms, enhancing 
collaboration and technology in sustainable energy.

core	business	while	unlocking	Malaysia’s	Energy	Transition	(ET)	ambition.	The	initiatives	spearheaded	by	the	Grid	Division	were	aimed	at	making	the	grid	
more	flexible,	supportive	of	Variable	Renewable	Energy,	and	capable	of	meeting	the	future	electricity	demands	of	Malaysia.
Unlocking Malaysia’ s ET Ambition
The Grid Division focused on three main roles in 2023, each crucial for supporting Malaysia’s journey towards a sustainable energy future:
Optimising Our Grid T ransmission Assets through Digitalisation 
Recognising	digitalisation	as	a	key	enabler	for	a	modern,	robust	and	flexible	grid,	we	have	continued	to	rolled	out	many	digital	initiatives	in	2023	under	
our	Grid	Digital	Transformation	(GDT)	Programme.	The	GDT	Programme	serves	as	our	roadmap	for	a	more	data-driven	business,	addressing	the	lack	of	
visibility and information on asset and asset systems. 
Some of the noteworthy milestones that were accomplished in 2023 were:
Our	continuing	efforts	to	optimise	our	transmission	network	has	resulted	in	us	being	positioned	in	the	Best	Performer	quadrant	of	the	International	
T ransmission Operation & Maintenance Study, with 13 of the evaluated 19 asset sub-functions being rated within that quadrant. This is an  
acknowledgement	of	our	continuous	drive	for	excellence	and	puts	on	par	with	other	prominent	transmission	utilities	globally.
By	 enhancing	 grid	 flexibility	 and	 strengthening	
regional interconnections, the division aimed 
to accommodate an increasing share of  
grid-connected renewable energy, particularly solar . 
This	 includes	 significant	 efforts	 in	 cross-border	
interconnection enhancements with Thailand through 
EGA T , demonstrating a commitment to regional energy 
collaboration and stability. The division also pursued 
the exploration of battery storage solutions as outlined 
in	 the	 JPPPET	 2021,	 undertaking	 feasibility	 studies	
for large-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) 
projects expected to commence in 2025.
Spurring the Growth of Variable Renewable Energy 
(VRE): 
2023	 saw	 Grid	 Division	 making	
substantial progress in supporting 
Malaysia’s	 electrification	 efforts,	
particularly for transportation and 
industrial sectors. This included 
enhancing the grid capacity and

demand from data centres, with  
63 applications for electricity supply 
connections received, primarily from 
Johor	and	Klang	Valley.
Advancing Electrification for 
T ransportation and Industrial 
Customers: 
Environmental and biodiversity conservation 
remained	a	top	priority.	Efforts	to	manage	
SF6	 gas	 leakage,	manage	pollutants,	and	
reduce	deforestation	were	 key	 highlights.	
Innovations	 like	 the	 Gas	 Insulated	 
Switchgear refurbishment, SF6 gas  
recycling, and the adoption of eco-friendly 
technologies underscored the division’s 
commitment to sustainability. In 2023, we 
successfully	recycled	7,511kg	of	 SF6	gas,	
which is more than double the previous  
year’s amount.
Reducing Grid’ s Own Carbon Footprint: 
AIPM is our intelligent system that helps us 
assess and optimise new asset investment 
options to boost system capability, reliability 
and availability in alignment with asset 
management best practices.

10 million customers across the nation, embodying the final stretch of electricity’s journey from power plants to the end user .
Building a Future-Proof Network that Facilitates the Energy T ransition
DN division’s strategies in 2023 have been carefully aligned with the broader vision of TNB’s Reimagining TNB strategy, particularly focusing on the 
‘Develop	 Energy	 Transition	Network’	strategic	 pillar.	This	vision	 emphasises	 the	development	 of	a	robust	and	resilient	 infrastructure	 capable	 of	 
supporting Malaysia’s ambitious ET goals. 
Since	 2016,	 DN	division	 has	embarked	 on	a	transformative	 journey	 through	the	Smart	Utility	 programme,	 aiming	 to	modernise	 the	distribution	
network	to	deliver	enhanced	value	to	customers.	This	comprehensive	initiative	focuses	on	five	key	areas:	asset	management,	work	management,	 
grid	operations,	energy	management,	and	customer	management.	In	2023,	these	efforts	were	marked	by	significant	milestones:
Continuing the momentum of digital 
transformation, the DN division successfully 
installed an additional 873,740 smart 
meters in 2023, surpassing the target of 
600,000 units. This expansion brings the 
total to over 3.5 million smart meters across 
the	Klang	Valley,	Melaka,	Kedah,	Johor,	and	
Penang, facilitating improved customer 
engagement and energy management.
The rollout of Distribution Automation 
(DA) has been pivotal in enabling 
automated	network	control	and	enhancing	
rapid supply restoration capabilities. 
Approximately 4,000 substations were 
successfully installed and commissioned 
in 2023, covering an estimated 2.6 million 
customers. This brings the total to 28,340 
distribution substations, representing 
34.0% of all distribution stations in 
Peninsular Malaysia.
Over 130 online feeder pillars 
were equipped with IoT devices 
and connected to the new DN 
Utility IoT (UIoT) platform. This 
integration allows DN to access 
near real-time information on 
load	 and	 low	 voltage	 network	 
parameters,	significantly	improving	 
load management and analytical 
capabilities.
DN	 become	 the	 first	 utility	 in	 the	 world	 to	adopt	 the	
Integration Standard Common Information Model 
(CIM): IEC 61968/61970 and 62325, which enables 
both Geospatial Information System and Advanced 
Distribution Management System to communicate with 
one another , thereby setting the foundation of more 
intelligent	network	management.	
A common architecture for the 
transmission	 and	 distribution	 network	
was developed, harmonising smart grid 
initiatives across TNB. This strategic 
collaboration, jointly developed with 
experts from both Grid and Distribution

at	a	world-class	 low	of	46.10	minutes	in	2023,	only	marginally	 higher	than	the	previous	year,	reflects	its	unwavering	dedication	 to	reliability	 and	 
service quality.
A highlight of DN’s strategic developments in 2023 was the Pulau 
Tenaga	Hijau	project.	This	project	saw	the	commissioning	of	the	first	
Building	Integrated	Photovoltaic	(BIPV)	Structure	on	Pulau	Perhentian,	
marking	a	significant	step	towards	responsible	energy	transition	in	line	
with Malaysia’s National Energy Roadmap (NETR). Generating clean 
energy	with	a	potential	of	110kWac,	this	initiative	underscores	TNB’s	
role	 as	 a	forward-thinking	 utility	 company.	Moreover,	the	 project’s	
progress includes the successful installation of smart meters and 
the	full	conversion	of	streetlights	to	energy-efficient	LEDs	on	Pulau	
Perhentian	and	Pulau	Redang,	enhancing	sustainability	and	efficiency	
on these islands.

ACHIEVING OUR STRA TEGIC AMBITIONS
OUTLOOK
As	we	advance	 towards	2024,	 the	 final	 year	 of	Regulatory	 Period	 3	 
(2022-2024), TNB’s Grid and DN divisions are set to continue their  
robust	investment	in	building	the	Develop	Energy	Transition	Network,	
with	an	anticipated	 CAPEX	of	RM6-7	billion	earmarked	for	expanding	
network	 assets.	 This	investment	 will	 cover	our	 plans	 to	install	 over	
800,000 smart meters and implement DA across an additional 
5,000 substations, demonstrating TNB’s commitment to enhancing 
efficiency	and	reliability.	Furthermore,	the	completion	of	the	Advanced	
Distribution Management System and Smart Energy Management 
Infrastructure stands as a testament to TNB’s drive towards  
modernising Malaysia’s energy infrastructure, leveraging technology to 
improve grid performance and customer engagement.
The Pulau Tenaga Hijau project will be moving into its second phase  
on	Pulau	Redang,	following	the	successful	commissioning	of	the	BIPV	 
on	 Pulau	 Perhentian.	 The	 full	 electrification	 of	 these	 islands	 is	
expected to be completed by 2027 and will help to reduce annual diesel 
consumption.
In	the	year	under	review,	TNB	saw	a	remarkable	 surge	in	electricity	
demand from data centres, with TNB receiving 63 applications totaling 
a maximum demand of 8.2GW, underscoring the digital economy’s 
growing energy needs. In response, we have clearly indicated our 
readiness	 to	 support	 this	 expansion	 with	 initiatives	 like	 the	 Green	
Lane Pathway (GLP) to expedite electricity connections for data 
centres. Several strategic partnerships have since been forged with 
data centre providers to onboard them into the GLP programme as we 
seek	to	foster	a	supportive	and	collaborative	environment	for	industry	
growth. Moving forward, we will be focused on rolling out the necessary  
network	infrastructure	upgrades	to	support	these	data	centres.
Grid	Division	will	proactively	undertake	a	large-scale	100MW/400MWh	
BESS,	 first	 of	 its	 kind	 project	 in	 the	 country,	 which	 will	 serve	 as	
a	 key	 enabler	 for	 the	 Develop	 Energy	 Transition	 Network,	 while	 
implementing various grid modernisation and digitalisation initiatives 
to	 improve	 its	 operational	 efficiency	 and	 accelerate	 its	 maturity	 in	
alignment	to	its	Smart	Green	Utility	Framework	(SGUF). 	
The new 1,500MW TNB-EGA T interconnection project will undergo 
approval processes with Suruhanjaya Tenaga for implementation in 
Regulatory Period 4. Meanwhile, new Terms of Reference for project 
implementation and a revised System Integration Agreement for the 
TNB-EGAT	interconnection	are	targeted	to	be	finalised	by	2024.

In	2023,	 TNB’s	Retail	 Division,	 set	 a	new	benchmark	 in	its	 history	 by	
achieving its highest ever CSI score of 88% with consistent placement  
in the top quartile for CSI performance, comparable to that of top UK  
and	 US	utilities.	 The	CSI	was	first	introduced	 27	years	 ago,	and	 TNB	
has diligently monitored it, using it as a crucial barometer of our 
overall	 performance	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 our	 service.	 This	 milestone	 
achievement	 reflects	 a	 significant	 evolution	 in	 TNB’s	 approach	 to	 
customer satisfaction, driven by a strategic shift in 2020 towards a 
customer-led paradigm that places customer needs and expectations  
at the forefront of its operations. 
Central to our customer-centric transformation is the way we measure 
the customer experience by using the Customer Experience Index, 
a comprehensive measure of customer interactions across various 
channels. The Retail Division achieved outstanding scores across the 
board, with Kedai Tenaga, TNB’s physical storefronts, leading at a 97% 
satisfaction score. This was closely followed by an impressive 96% for 
both the Careline service and the myTNB app, and a commendable 91% 
for the myTNB portal. 
In addition, we recorded good customer sentiment in social media 
presence,	 highlighting	 the	 positive	 and	 neutral	 feedback	 from	 
customers. This high sentiment rating is largely attributed to 
TNB’s proactive engagement strategies, particularly its proactive 
communication ahead of seasonal events such as heatwaves and  
floods,	and	utilisation	of	a	humanistic	and	empathetic	tone	that	resonated	
well with the public.
Digitalisation continues to play a pivotal role in the Retail Division’s 
strategy to enhance customer service. The adoption of the myTNB  
digital platform saw a notable increase of almost 10%, with subscribers 
reaching	 6.68	 million,	 up	 from	 6.2	 million	 in	 the	 previous	 fiscal	 year.	 
Besides	 offering	 seamless	 payment	options	 and	the	ability	to	manage	
energy	consumption,	the	myTNB	app	also	offers	paperless	billing	which	
The diagram below summarises where our subsidiaries’ play in TNB’s ET value chain: 
has seen encouraging response as over 1 million subscribers have opted 
for digital billing. The app has been recognised for its value in empowering 
customers and received the Best Public Utility App Award from PC.com in 
June 2023. 
myTNBiz is the digital platform for our business customers that was 
launched	in	October	2022	to	provide	service	offerings	such	as	bill	viewing	
and	bulk	online	payment.	Specifically	for	our	commercial	and	industrial	
customers, this platform is continuously gaining increased traction, with 
over 10,325 total users and 194,254 connected customer accounts.
The year also saw exceptional growth in followership in TNB’s social  
media platforms experience, registering a 15% increase and achieving a 
reach of over 205.2 million across all social media platforms. The success 
in our digital engagement is indicative of the division’s ability to connect 
with	our	customers,	offering	solutions	and	energy	efficiency	tips	that	for	
the	first	time,	ranked	among	the	top	10	posts	of	the	year.
Lastly, TNB’s very own Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) was 
officially	launched	as	a	national-level	initiative	in	March	2023.	It	aims	to	
enhance energy literacy among Malaysians by educating the public on the 
significance	of	energy	management	and	conservation.	To	further	embed	
energy literacy into the younger generation, TNB, through its Universiti 
Tenaga Nasional has collaborated with Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia to 
incorporate energy literacy modules within the academic curriculum of 
tertiary level programmes. We believe that MELP’s elevation to a national 
programme underscores its vital contribution to the country’s energy 
transition journey, aligning with the objectives of the NETR.

TNB’s active engagement in shaping energy policies and its support for the government’s  
agenda were also manifested through alignment with the 12 th Malaysia Plan 2021-2025, Key 
Ministries Strategic Planning 2025, and the visions and missions of State Governments. These 
efforts	 underscored	 TNB’s	 dedication	 to	 facilitating	 a	 smooth	 transition	 towards	 a	 more	
sustainable	 and	renewable	energy	(RE)	landscape,	 reinforcing	its	position	as	a	key	player	in	
Malaysia’s journey towards achieving a 70% RE target by 2050. 
We also recognise the evolving challenges within the regulatory landscape such as the  
formation of a new energy ministry in December 2023. These structural adjustments have 
tangible implications for the governance of the energy sector . In response, our Strategic 
Engagement	Roadmap	for	2023	identified	21	Key	Focus	Areas,	with	a	priority	on	engagements	
related to the Regulatory Period 4 proposal and the communication plan for the Imbalance  
Cost Pass- Through (ICPT) mechanism.
We will continue to be guided by our consistent, professional and collaborative approach with 
regulatory	stakeholders,	noting	that	our	Regulatory	Relationship	Strength	Index	(RRSI)	score	
has improved further . In 2023, TNB achieved its highest RRSI score yet, with an impressive T rust 
Index	of	92%.	This	score	reflects	a	strong	rapport	and	trust	between	TNB	and	the	regulators,	
showcasing a notable increase from previous years and indicating a consistent upward  
trajectory	in	stakeholder	relations.	The	RRSI	serves	as	a	crucial	metric,	evaluating	the	level	of	
stakeholders’	trust	in	TNB	and	highlighting	the	company’s	ability	to	understand	and	meet	the	
needs	of	key	stakeholders	for	future	improvement	plans.
Strengthening the Electric Supply Industry (ESI)
In 2023, TNB continues to contribute towards reinforcing the structure and sustainability of  
the	ESI	in	Malaysia.	A	key	initiative	 in	this	endeavour	was	TNB’s	active	participation	 in	the	 
“Future-proofing	MESI	Study,”	spearheaded	by	MyPower.	This	study	was	aimed	at	identifying	
optimal pathways for the evolution of the Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI), 
with a focus on achieving a balance between energy security, energy equity, environmental 
sustainability, economic development, and enhancing customer experience. The primary 
objective was to ensure that MESI could adapt to future challenges, especially those arising from 
the urgent need to decarbonise in a landscape characterised by diverse and shifting demands.
The study provided a comprehensive long-term roadmap and implementation plan, laying the 
groundwork	for	MESI	to	face	forthcoming	challenges	with	resilience,	despite	the	pressures	of	
faster decarbonisation. In 2023, MyPower Corp.’s focus was on disseminating the outcomes of 
the	study	among	key	stakeholders,	including	TNB,	to	coordinate	and	ensure	a	smooth	rollout	
of	the	initiatives	identified.	This	study	underscored	the	importance	of	transitioning	towards	a	
sustainable energy future, in line with Malaysia’s economic development goals.
An integral part of strengthening MESI would be the establishment of an energy exchange, 
overseen by an independent Single Buyer . This proposed initiative would be pivotal in  
streamlining the mechanisms for managing the planning and procurement of electricity in 
Peninsular Malaysia as it would enhance industry transparency and clarity while setting a fair 
and	competitive	price	for	energy	based	on	supply	and	demand.	This,	in	turn,	benefits	both	
generators and consumers. TNB has expressed its full support for the newly planned energy 
exchange,	emphasising	its	commitment	to	facilitating	a	comprehensive	framework	that	ensures	
seamless connection and trading of RE between generators and consumers.
Another	 critical	 government-led	 effort	 that	 has	 ensured	 the	 sustainability	 of	 MESI	 has	
been the implementation of the ICPT mechanism. The ICPT is a crucial tool that allows 
TNB	 to	 adjust	 electricity	 tariffs	 in	 response	 to	 fluctuations	 in	 fuel	 and	 generation	 costs.	
In 2023, the government again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to the ICPT , 
approving subsidies amounting to RM10.4 billion for the period of January to June and an 
additional RM4.7 billion for July to December and enabling TNB to recover approximately  
RM15.1 billion in total. The government’s strong commitment to the ICPT mechanism has had 
a direct and positive impact on the stability of TNB and by extension, the nation’s electricity 
supply industry.

In support of the energy transition, the government expanded 
the Corporate Green Power Programme by an additional 200MW, 
bringing the total quota to 800MW. This expansion, coupled with the 
extension	 of	the	application	 deadline,	 signifies	 a	strong	push	towards	
increasing corporate participation in renewable energy generation. 
Similarly, the expansion of the Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme 
through an additional quota allocation of 1,450MW under NEM 3.0,  
reflects	a	concerted	effort	to	facilitate	the	adoption	of	solar	energy	and	
enhance energy sustainability within the business sector .
TNB’s active participation in the ET journey was further showcased at 
the Conference of the Electricity Power Supply Industry (CEPSI) 2023 
and the 28 th	Conference	 of	the	Parties	(COP28)	to	the	UN	Framework	
Convention on Climate Change. CEPSI provided a global platform for TNB  
to	 affirm	 its	 commitment	 to	 leading	 Malaysia’s	 energy	 transition,	
presenting transformative renewable energy projects and fostering 
international collaboration. TNB’s leadership at the conference, including 
technical paper presentations and the receipt of accolades, highlighted 
its	 role	 as	 a	 thought	 leader	 and	 key	 player	 in	 navigating	 the	 global	 
energy transition towards a low-carbon future.
Meanwhile, TNB’s commitment to COP28 is in line with our strategic 
objectives, aiming to reinforce our role in driving the energy transition 
within Malaysia and the wider region. TNB is proud to support Malaysia’s 
climate	change	agenda,	working	closely	with	the	government	and	various	
ecosystem players across the energy transition value chain at COP28. 
This	 dedicated	 effort	 underscores	 TNB’s	 commitment	 to	 spearhead	
sustainable energy solutions for a better , brighter future.
OUTLOOK
Looking	ahead,	the	upcoming	RP4	is	poised	to	be	a	critical	phase	for	TNB,	marking	a	significant	shift	in	Malaysia’s	energy	sector	regulation	and	
policy	framework.	The	groundwork	for	the	RP4	regulatory	submission	has	been	carefully	prepared,	reflecting	TNB’s	proactive	approach	to	align	
with	evolving	energy	needs	and	sustainability	goals.	The	proposal	development	process	has	been	comprehensive,	incorporating	feedback	from	
stakeholder	engagement	and	adhering	to	internal	business	planning	processes.
T wo overarching strategic objectives form the core of the RP4 proposal: Delivering for our customers and Facilitating the Energy T ransition. These 
objectives emphasise TNB’s commitment to ensuring a stable and secure electricity supply while also supporting Malaysia’s ambitious goals for  
a	sustainable	energy	future.	TNB’s	dedication	to	these	objectives	is	evident	in	its	efforts	to	foster	the	integration	of	renewable	generation,	expand	
consumer choices, and address the challenges across the electricity supply value chain.
Moreover,	the	RP4	proposal	is	crafted	to	harmonise	six	key	objectives,	ensuring	a	holistic	approach	that	delivers	comprehensive	benefits	to	the	
nation. These objectives are:
As	TNB	 embarks	 on	this	 crucial	 journey,	2024	 is	designated	 as	the	 negotiation	 period	 for	RP4.	 During	 this	 time,	 TNB	 will	 engage	 in	close	 
collaboration	with	Suruhanjaya	Tenaga	and	relevant	ministries	to	refine	and	finalise	the	proposal.	This	collaborative	effort	underscores	TNB’s	role

THE MARKET LANDSCAPE
With the COVID-19 pandemic firmly in the past 
and economic recovery driving the country 
forward, customers’ electricity demand in 
Peninsular Malaysia grew by 3.6% in 2023. The 
supply side saw coal contributing to 57.0% of the 
generation mix, followed by gas at 36.7%, hydro 
at 4.6%, solar at 1.5% and distillates at 0.2%.
In 2023, the global energy landscape, particularly in the coal sector , 
experienced	 significant	 dynamics	 shaped	 by	 fluctuating	 demand,	
geopolitical tensions, and the gradual shift towards cleaner energy 
sources. Despite challenges, global coal demand remained robust, 
with consumption hitting new all-time highs, driven by various factors  
including the economic recovery post-pandemic and the energy needs of 
emerging economies.
Coal prices, after soaring to unprecedented levels in 2022 due to a tight 
global supply and increased demand, particularly from Europe’s shift  
back	 to	 coal	 amid	 the	 Russia-Ukraine	 conflict	 and	 supply	 chain	 
disruptions,	began	to	stabilise	in	2023.	This	stabilisation	was	influenced	
by	factors	such	as	mild	weather	conditions	in	Europe,	ample	stockpiles	at	
coal-fired	power	plants,	and	a	gradual	convergence	of	coal	prices	across	
different	regions.	
NAVIGA TING THE FUEL PRICE HEADWINDS
In	FY2023,	 the	average	market	 coal	price	 moderated	 to	USD	134/MT	
reflecting	a	significant	decrease	from	the	all-time	high	above	USD	415/MT	 
in May 2022, yet still substantially higher than the base coal price of  
USD 79/MT set for Regulatory Period 3 (RP3).
While coal prices were not as high as 2022, it still posed a challenge to 
the	system’s	financial	stability	as	generation	costs	make	up	65%	of	the	
electricity	costs	in	the	tariff.	TNB’s	cash	flow	continued	to	be	pressured	
due to the high payment obligations to ensure security of supply to 
customers.
Nevertheless, the industry was able to navigate these headwinds with  
the implementation of the Imbalance Cost Pass- Through (ICPT)  
mechanism	 that	 reflected	 the	 government’s	 response	 to	 fluctuating	
global fuel prices and its commitment to energy sustainability. The ICPT 
mechanism,	 under	 the	 Incentive	 Based	 Regulation	 (IBR)	 framework,	
reflects	changes	in	fuel	and	generation-related	 costs	in	the	electricity	
tariff,	aiming	to	manage	these	fluctuations	effectively. 	
With	 the	 price	 of	 coal	 tracking	 downwards	 as	 the	 year	 progressed,	
adjustments were made to the ICPT mechanism to minimise the 
ICPT surcharge’s impact on consumers while encouraging energy 
efficiency	and	the	adoption	of	renewable	energy	(RE)	sources	to	control	 
electricity costs.
2023 Adjustments
In 2023, the government allocated a total electricity subsidy of 
approximately RM16 billion to mitigate the impact of fuel price 
volatility	 on	 electricity	 tariffs.	 This	 subsidy	 aimed	 to	 ensure	
that most consumers, especially domestic and non-domestic 
low-voltage	 users,	 would	 not	 be	 adversely	 affected	 by	 tariff	
adjustments, despite the high average price of coal exceeding 
the RP3 projected fuel cost. 
For	the	period	 1	January	 2023	 until	 30	June	 2023,	 the	tariff	
rate was maintained for domestic, Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs), and all Agricultural customers. There was 
also	a	surcharge	of	20	sen/kWh	applied	to	other	Non-Domestic	
customers.
For the period 1 July 2023 until 31 December 2023, the  
government rolled out a targeted subsidy scheme where  
MSMEs,	 specific	 agricultural	 sectors,	 and	 a	 new	 category	 of	
water and sanitation operators enjoyed maintained or reduced 
surcharges. For domestic consumers, the ICPT rebate was 
applied	to	those	with	a	monthly	consumption	of	up	to	1,500kWh,	
with a surcharge for high-consumption users exceeding this 
threshold.

THE MARKET LANDSCAPE
2024 Adjustments
In December 2023, further adjustments were 
announced for the period of January 1 until  
June 30, 2024. This included maintaining a  
2	sen/kWh	rebate	for	domestic	users	with	a	monthly	
electricity	consumption	of	up	to	600kWh,	a	change	
from	 the	 previous	 threshold	 of	 1,500kWh.	 No	
surcharge was applied for consumption between 
601kWh	 and	 1,500kWh,	 while	 the	 surcharge	
for	 consumption	 above	 1,500kWh	 remained	 at	 
10	 sen/kWh.	 These	 adjustments	 ensured	 that	 
85%	of	domestic	consumers	would	not	be	affected,	
focusing government subsidies more precisely.  
Non-domestic users, including commercial and 
industrial	 low-voltage	 tariff	 categories,	 water	
and	 sanitation	 operators,	and	 specific	 agricultural	 
tariffs,	 did	 not	 see	 an	increase	 in	their	 electricity	
tariffs,	 with	 the	 ICPT	 surcharge	 maintained	 at	 
3.7	 sen/kWh	 for	 them.	 Other	 non-domestic	
consumers continued to face a surcharge of  
17	sen/kWh.
DRIVING A RESPONSIBLE ENERGY TRANSITION
Malaysia	has	taken	a	significant	 step	forward	in	its	energy	transition	(ET)	journey	
in 2023 as the government clearly articulated the pathway to achieving Net Zero 
Emissions by 2050. Through important policy and roadmap announcements, such  
as the National Energy T ransition Roadmap (NETR) and the Malaysia Energy  
Transition	Outlook,	the	country	now	has	a	detailed	roadmap	for	the	transition	that	
will also create economic growth, job opportunities and income generation in green 
industries.
The	 NETR	 includes	 flagship	 catalyst	 projects	 like	 Hybrid	 Hydro-Floating	 Solar	
Photovoltaic,	Large-Scale	Solar	Parks,	and	Co-firing	of	Hydrogen-Ammonia.	These	
projects are part of Malaysia’s broader aspirations to achieve net zero carbon  
emissions and a 70% installation of RE capacity by 2050. In addition, the upcoming 
introduction	 of	an	RE	exchange	 in	2024	signifies	 a	major	step	towards	economic	
opportunities for domestic RE industry players and aligns with the nation’s  
sustainable development goals.
At the heart of Malaysia’s ET is the shift from fossil fuel-based systems to RE sources, 
such as solar power , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance ESG factors. 
This transition, termed as “ Just Energy T ransition”, adds a social dimension by  
ensuring that the transformation is equitable and inclusive, stressing on community 
involvement, job creation, universal energy access, and socio-economic 
considerations.
TNB’s role in this transition is pivotal, focusing on decarbonising power generation 
through investment in green technologies, strengthening the grid and empowering 
electrification	 across	 sectors.	 By	 fostering	 collaboration	 with	 government	 and	
stakeholders,	TNB	is	at	the	forefront	of	ensuring	a	reliable,	resilient	and	flexible	grid	 
to support Malaysia’s energy needs.
Malaysia’s	energy	policies	chart	a	definitive	route	to	Net	Zero	by	2050,	promoting	green	industry	growth	and	job	creation.

SUST AINABILITY GOVERNANCE
A	strong	sustainability	 governance	and	leadership	structure	is	vital	to	spearhead	our	sustainability	 agenda	and	provide	us	with	clear	and	definitive	
guidance	to	achieve	our	net	zero	aspirations.	Our	sustainability	governance	forms	a	part	of	the	TNB	Governance	Framework	that	is	aligned	with	the	
principles of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG). The TNB Sustainability Governance Structure is in place to facilitate oversight, 
strategic management, and implementation of sustainability strategies and initiatives at all levels.
A	key	development	 to	strengthen	 the	 TNB	 Sustainability	 Governance	
Structure	 is	 the	 formation	 of	 the	 BSRC,	 which	 has	 taken	 effect	 on	 
25 August 2023. Our BOD continues to demonstrate its commitment 
towards our sustainability agenda by expanding the oversight scope of  
the	TNB	Board	Risk	Committee	to	include	sustainability;	 with	that,	the	
Board	 Risk	 Committee	 was	 renamed	 BSRC	 with	 enhanced	 terms	 of	
reference.	 The	 BSRC	 remains	 dedicated	 to	 overseeing	 the	 effective	
implementation	of	sustainability	initiatives	with	robust	risk	management	
to address exposures and harness opportunities and to ensure strategic 
integration	of	sustainability	into	operations	and	decision-making.
T o further enhance the deployment of our sustainability strategies, the 
BOD	approved	the	formation	of	the	Sustainability	Division,	which	our	first	
Chief	Sustainability	Officer	has	led	since	June	2023.	The	primary	function	
of	the	Sustainability	Division	is	to	ensure	the	effective	deployment	of	our	
sustainability strategies to meet targets and to strengthen sustainability 
governance across the Group. The division engages, facilitates, and 
advises the Business Entities on their day-to-day implementation of 
sustainability and energy transition initiatives.

With the above in mind, our sustainability agenda focuses on material ESG matters outlined in our materiality matrix. We have a comprehensive materiality 
assessment	every	two	(2)	years;	the	last	was	in	FY2022.	This	assessment	allows	us	to	stay	ahead	of	emerging	trends,	changing	stakeholder	expectations,	
and other operational challenges. In 2023, we carried out a limited-scale materiality review. 
We based the materiality assessment process on the following three (3) phases, as guided by the Bursa Sustainability Reporting Guide (3 rd Edition):
As a result, the eleven (11) material matters for FY2023 are depicted in the materiality matrix below. 
TNB MA TERIALITY ASSESSMENT
Cross reference with the Sustainability Performance Table in the Sustainability Statement that includes linkages of performance to UN SDGs.
• “Community Development and Human Rights” has increased in priority for 
stakeholders,	 reflecting	 their	 interest	 in	 TNB’s	 management	 of	 a	just	 energy	
transition across the value chain, particularly regarding human rights. 
•	 Prioritisation	 for	“Cybersecurity	Management”,	“Safety,	Health	and	Well-being”	
and	“Employment	Culture”	have	lowered,	reflecting	stakeholders’	confidence	of	
the outcome in our ongoing initiatives.
•	 The	 material	matter	related	to	the	supply	chain	has	been	refined	to	“Sustainable	
and Responsible (added) Supply Chain”, emphasising the importance of sustainable 
and responsible practices across the entire supply chain. 
Our revised Materiality Matrix renews our focus on material matters, which forms 
the basis of our Sustainability Statement. The respective indicators facilitate the 
monitoring and measurement of our sustainability performance. 
The following is a summary of critical updates to the TNB Materiality Matrix FY2023 as 
compared to FY2022: 
• Matters related to “Customer Experience and Satisfaction”, previously disclosed 
as a sub-topic in “Responsible Business and Financial Performance”, are now a 
separate material matter highlighting increasing customer expectations towards 
accelerating	energy	transition	and	energy	efficiency. 	
• “Energy Transition and Innovation” and “Climate Change and Emission” remain key 
priorities for stakeholders and TNB. 
• “Environmental Management” has shifted to a slightly lower priority for TNB. 
Environmental matters relating to emissions, water, and waste form part of our 
energy transition, as well as climate change material matters and strategy. 
• “Responsible Business and Financial Performance” has shifted to a higher priority, 
reflecting	our	strategy	and	focus	on	responsibly	balancing	the	energy	trilemma.

Malaysia’ s energy transition (ET) efforts to achieve Net Zero by 2050 will shift the nation’ s generation mix 
from fossil fuel-driven energy to renewable and green energy. Despite the push to increase renewable energy 
(RE) capacity, natural gas will continue to play a pivotal role in Malaysia’ s energy landscape as the nation moves  
towards a low-carbon economy.
MM
2  Energy T ransition and Innovation
The	government	and	TNB	have	made	a	clear	commitment	that	there	will	be	no	new	build-up	of	greenfield	coal	plants.	Nevertheless,	the	role	of	coal	in	the	
short-	to	medium-term	is	critical	to	allow	diversification	of	the	energy	mix	and	ensure	security	of	supply.	Higher	RE	integration	(especially	solar)	into	the	
national	grid	requires	timely	investment	to	enable	a	smart	and	flexible	grid	system.	On	the	demand	side,	electrification	and	energy	efficiency	continue	to	
significantly	contribute	towards	the	nation’s	energy	transition	journey.
In	line	with	the	above,	the	TNB	ET	Plan	comprises	three	(3)	strategic	pillars	with	key	enablers	in	shifting	from	a	fossil-based	energy	mix	to	greener	energy	
sources. These initiatives align with our Reimagining TNB (RT) implementation that cuts across the electricity value chain, from transitioning power 
generation	to	Deliver	Clean	Generation	and	enhancing	the	Develop	Energy	Transition	Network	to	enable	more	green	solutions,	to	Dynamic	Energy	
Solutions	by	enhancing	customer	experiences	through	digitalisation	and	electrification.	TNB	actively	invests	in	and	develops	innovative	solutions	to	
expedite our ET plan. 
TNB’s ET journey is further strengthened with our active participation in the National Energy T ransition Roadmap (NETR), which aims to reduce the 
nation’s	carbon	footprint.	Three	(3)	of	TNB’s	ET	projects	have	been	adopted	under	two	(2)	of	the	NETR’s	flagship	catalyst	initiatives,	namely	solar	 
park	 and	 hybrid	 hydro	 floating	 solar	 PV	 under	 the	 RE	 Zone	 initiative	 and	 co-firing	 of	 hydrogen	 and	 ammonia	 under	 the	 Hydrogen	 for	 Power

The	 energy	 transition,	 marked	 by	 a	 shift	 from	 conventional	 fossil	 
fuel-based energy sources to cleaner and more sustainable alternatives, 
significantly	 impacts	 electrical	 grids.	 Distributed	 energy	 resources	
(DERs) such as rooftop solar panels play a pivotal role in creating a more 
decentralised energy landscape. 
Unlike	 the	 traditional	 one-way	 flow	 of	 energy	 from	 power	 plants	
to consumers through the transmission and distribution grid, this 
decentralisation	 introduces	 a	bidirectional	 flow	of	electricity.	Consumers	
now increasingly become prosumers, actively participating in both 
electricity production and consumption. The management of these 
dynamic	 energy	 flows	 necessitates	 the	 implementation	 of	 smart	 grids	 
and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).
In	2023,	the	Grid	Division	and	Distribution	Network	Division	invested	over	
RM2.9 billion and RM5 billion of capital expenditure, respectively, in securing, 
maintaining and modernising our national grid. The highlights of our smart 
grid initiatives include the facilitation of RE penetration into the system, 
expanding	AMI	and	real-time	network	monitoring	and	control.	Additionally,	 
in	2023,	we	enhanced	our	efforts	in	realising	the	ASEAN	Power	Grid	aspiration	
by forming strategic partnerships with ASEAN Member States in the region.
Facilitation of RE Penetration
The development of Large Scale Solar (LSS) is thriving, with the current 
operational	 installed	 capacity	of	473MW	in	the	Distribution	 network	and	
1,340MW	in	the	Grid	network.	TNB’s	physical	grid	infrastructure	 has	the	
capacity	to	support	up	to	12,000MW	without	significant	need	for	upgrades,	
assuming that the introduction of solar power follows the planned phases 
and allocations accordingly.
T o promote the growth of LSS, our primary focus is on improving grid 
flexibility	 while	 ensuring	 system	stability.	To	facilitate	 the	integration	 of	
DERs	 by	 developers	 and	 stakeholders,	 we	 have	 collaborated	 with	 the	
Sustainable Energy Development Authority Malaysia (SEDA) to develop a 
Distributed Generation Hosting Capacity map. This initiative aims to identify 
available DER connection points and capacities at the medium voltage level  
(33kV	and	11kV).	
Through this map, accessible via a Geographic Information System 
(GIS) platform, both internal and external users can easily access a  
comprehensive list of substations with hosting capacity. This streamlined 
process	simplifies	the	connection	of	RE	sources	to	the	grid	and	supports	
effective	RE	planning	efforts.
TNB	 has	 also	 undertaken	 a	 pilot	 project	 to	 develop	 battery	
energy storage to reinforce grid resilience for RE integration via  
interconnection, called Projek Rintis Sistem Penstoran Bateri. 
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)
The AMI plays a foundational role in managing a complex energy value 
chain and facilitates energy transition and customer empowerment 
through	 network	 visibility.	 Since	 the	 AMI	 project	 deployment,	 
3,549,489	smart	meters	have	been	installed,	mainly	in	the	Klang	Valley,	
Melaka,	Kedah	and	Penang.	In	2023,	an	additional	873,740	smart	meters	
were installed, exceeding our target of 600,000 units. TNB is mandated 
to roll out AMI and smart meters to more than 9 million Ordinary Power 
Customers (OPC) in Peninsular Malaysia through year 2027 and beyond.
Customers with smart meters can gain insights into their energy 
consumption through half-hourly energy usage analysis. The granular 
information	 provided	 by	 smart	 meters	 benefits	 our	 customers	 and	
empowers our operations to pinpoint grid issues and understand 
consumer	behaviours	for	more	effective	service	delivery.	By	providing	
access to this information through the myTNB mobile app and 
myTNB Portal, customers acquire the ability to optimise their energy 
consumption, leading to reduced costs and minimised environmental 
impacts.
Network Monitoring and Control
Key	efforts	to	enhance	real-time	network	monitoring	and	control	include	
Distribution Automation and voltage and reactive power management.

Distribution Automation (DA)
The	 DA	 Project	 facilitates	 automated	 network	 control	 and	
expedites rapid supply restoration. The project’s objective is to 
progressively install DA systems in 41% of Peninsular Malaysia’s 
total substations by the end of 2024, 64% by the end of 2027, and 
84% by the end of 2030. In 2023 alone, the DA Project successfully 
installed and commissioned 4,002 substations that serve  
approximately 2.6 million customers. This brings our total DA 
installations since 2014 to approximately 28,340 distribution 
substations, covering 34% of Peninsular Malaysia’s total distribution 
stations. Notably, we have observed an average 20% reduction in 
restoration time for unplanned outages, with outages typically restored 
within 15 minutes on average.

Enhancing the Interconnected ASEAN Power Grid
Cross-border interconnections play a vital role in advancing ASEAN’s ET 
and achieving decarbonisation goals. The establishment of the ASEAN 
Power Grid is poised to bolster regional grid stability and security while 
enabling resource-sharing and facilitating RE expansion across Member 
States. In 2023, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGA T) 
and	 TNB	 established	 an	in-house	 Joint	 Working	 Committee	 (JWC)	 to	 
undertake	a	feasibility	study	on	enhancing	the	interconnection	capacity	
between Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. This study, completed in  
August 2023, explored potential technologies and designs, evaluated 
power system dynamics, analysed interconnection operations and 
maintenance,	 and	 conducted	 cost-benefit	 assessments.	 The	 aim	
was to harness mutual resources and develop the necessary regional 
infrastructure to promote RE adoption.
Several Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) have been signed 
with ASEAN nations, namely Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, to 
foster collaboration in interconnection projects. Ongoing feasibility 
studies are being conducted to establish new cross-border electricity 
interconnections,	linking	Peninsular	Malaysia	with	Sumatra	in	Indonesia,	
as	well	as	developing	a	second	interconnection	link	to	Singapore.
We participate as a charging point operator (CPO) through TNBX Sdn. Bhd. (TNBX), equipment and charging manufacturer through Tenaga Switchgear 
Sdn.	Bhd.	(TSG)	and	EV	training	hub	through	TNB	Integrated	Learning	Solution	(ILSAS).
In	2023,	we	electrified	108	vehicles	as	part	of	our	effort	to	replace	30%	of	our	fleet	with	EVs	by	2030.	A	majority	of	these	vehicles	are	Operational	 
Electric	Vehicles	comprising	pickup	trucks,	vans	and	passenger	vehicles,	as	part	of	our	initiative	to	analyse	the	advantages	and	limitations	of	using	EVs

Among	 the	 ten	 (10)	 flagship	 catalyst	 projects	 in	 the	 NETR	 is	 the	
implementation of Projek Rintis Sistem Penstoran Bateri, a Battery Energy 
Storage System (BESS) to support the 70% RE capacity target by 2050. 
In 2023, the Grid Division conducted a feasibility study of potential sites 
for	a	large-scale	BESS	flagship	project.	This	pilot	BESS,	with	an	energy	
capacity of 400MWh, will be implemented by TNB, operated by the Grid 
System Operator and regulated by the Energy Commission. It is expected 
to commence in 2025.
Energy Usage
Consumers	play	a	key	role	in	a	successful	energy	transition.	In	2023,	we	
took	significant	strides	in	contributing	towards	a	low-mobility	ecosystem,	
enabling RE adoption by customers and empowering customers through 
digitalised	 lifestyles.	 We	 further	 embarked	 on	 two	 (2)	 differentiated	
solutions for data centre customers in the form of the Greenlane Pathway 
for a One-Stop Centre and broadband solutions for targeted groups.
Electrification of Mobility
In spurring the development of a low-mobility ecosystem, TNB has 
committed	RM90	million	to	accelerate	the	electric	vehicle	(EV)	adoption	
rate in Malaysia over a duration of three (3) years (2022-2024). In 2023, 
we	deployed	EV	charging	stations	along	Peninsular	Malaysia’s	highways	
and	trunk	roads	to	facilitate	long-distance	 customer	travel	throughout	
Peninsular Malaysia.

With the implementation of the GET since 2022, customers can purchase 
a low-carbon electricity supply without having to install their own solar 
rooftop or other RE installations. The RE resources for the GET Programme 
are generated by solar power plants under the LSS Programme, hydropower 
stations and any other qualified RE plants approved by the Energy Commission. 
Customers enrolled in the GET Programme receive the Malaysia Renewable 
Energy Certificate (mREC) at the end of each calendar year . TNB continues to 
provide platforms to facilitate customer enrolment. In 2023, a total of 4.452 
million GET blocks were subscribed by 2,753 customers.
Customer Empowerment through Digitalised Lifestyles
Our customers play a critical role in supporting the energy transition by 
making smart choices and participating in various RE and Energy Efficiency 
(EE) programmes. With more than 3.5 million successful installations of  
smart meters by 2023 and 6.4 million myTNB app adoptions, customers are  
able to experience the benefits of near real-time energy consumption 
monitoring and budget management. Through myTNB, customers who

3 Climate Change and Emissions
Climate Change
The	transition	to	decarbonisation	 focuses	on	the	progressive	expansion	of	low-carbon	generation	assets	and	the	phasing	down	of	our	coal-fired	
generation	capacity	in	stages.	This	is	further	supported	by	our	approach	to	efficiently	operating	thermal	power	plant	operations	and	investing	in	
innovative	solutions	research	and	development	to	scale	up	efficient	energy	generation	and	carbon	capture	technologies.
At the core of TNB’s Energy T ransition Plan lies the ambition to achieve Net Zero Emissions and coal-free plant operations by 2050. The transition 
to Net Zero Emissions began with an interim target of a 35% reduction in emissions intensity by 2035 before achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050.  
The	delivery	of	these	targets	is	anchored	on	our	business	operations,	national	policies	and	international	frameworks	on	climate	change	that	are	aligned	
with supporting Malaysia’s ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
We	continue	to	assess	and	mitigate	physical	and	transition	risks,	guided	
by the Representative Concentrating Pathways (RCP) scenarios from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and scenarios 
proposed	by	the	Network	of	Central	Banks	and	Supervisors	for	Greening	
the Financial System (NGFS).
We also identify business opportunities associated with transitioning 
to	a	low-carbon	 economy	and	implement	 adaptation	 plans	 for	floods,	
heatwaves, soil movement and coastal inundation.
The TNB ET Plan outlines our long-term strategy to address climate 
change and emissions, as below: 
We aim to reduce emissions, strategising for:
Cleaner generation capacity Increased RE capacity Enhanced	operational	efficiency	
across the value chain
We	have	identified	Carbon	Capture	&	Storage	(CCS)	technology	as	a	potential	solution	in	decarbonising	the	
power sector . We continue to play an active role in researching and advancing this technology
For the remaining hard-to-abate emissions, we are exploring the development of carbon credits with nature-based

In	2021,	TNB	committed	to	no	longer	investing	in	greenfield	coal	plants.	We	are	exploring	the	viability	of	retiring	coal-fired	power	plants	earlier	than	
planned, subject to shareholders’ agreement and approvals from the relevant authorities and regulators. The GHG Scope 1 emissions of our coal power 
plants is expected to reduce as these plants retire according to the respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), as follows:
Our	partnerships	with	Mitsui	&	Co.	and	Chugoku	are	making	substantial	
strides	in	advancing	the	feasibility	study	for	co-firing	coal	with	biomass	
and ammonia at the Jimah East Power Plant. Following the successful 
completion of the feasibility study at Phase 1, we started Phase 2, with an 
in-depth analysis of technical behaviours through a small-scale project 
of	actual	co-firing	with	varying	concentrations	of	ammonia	and	biomass.	
This phase involved conducting a Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) 
study	for	this	small-scale	co-firing	project.
A	significant	milestone	was	achieved	with	the	successful	execution	of	the	
EFB-Pellet T rial Burn for Unit 2 (1,000MW) in September 2023. Notably,  
this	 marked	 the	 first	 Biomass	 Mix-Firing	 test	 for	 a	 Supercritical	 type	
of boiler in Malaysia. The trial run demonstrated positive outcomes, 
showcasing observable reductions in emissions. Moving forward, further 
studies and actual tests will be conducted to assess the technical 
behaviour under increased concentrations, e.g. 3% to 5% of biomass and 
ammonia.	This	ongoing	exploration	is	integral	to	refining	and	optimising	
our	co-firing	strategies	for	enhanced	sustainability.
Reducing Carbon Emissions
We continue to accelerate the transition from a fossil-fuel-based energy 
mix to low-carbon energy sources such as hydrogen. Through strategic 
collaboration	 with	IHI	Corporation,	we	are	working	together	to	reduce	
carbon	emissions	in	identified	TNB	coal-fired	power	plants.	Our	goal	is	to	
explore	the	practicality	of	using	hydrogen	in	co-firing	and	conducting	tests	
with	different	 hydrogen	concentrations	 to	achieve	targeted	 emissions	
reductions. This collaboration focuses on both technical and commercial 
aspects, paving the way for a more sustainable energy future.

TNB-PETRONAS MOU signed on 19 August 2022, the parties are  
advancing	towards	a	Definitive	Agreement	for	a	Joint	Feasibility	Study	
focused on green hydrogen as a clean energy alternative. The collaborative 
study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of commercial 
viability, considering factors such as the levelised cost of electricity 
(LCOE), levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), levelised cost of storage 
(LCOS), and the sales price of hydrogen (H 2).
Our strategy to repower our coal power plants with cleaner technologies 
is	focused	on	Kapar	Energy	Ventures	(KEV),	TNB	Janamanjung	 (TNBJ)	
and Jimah East Power (JEP). This repowering exercise, which utilises 
existing sites and infrastructure to generate electricity utilising cleaner 
technologies such as hydrogen-ready gas power plants and gas power 
plants equipped with CCS technologies, is expected to reduce our GHG 
Scope 1 emissions.

Thermal	 power	 plants	 can	 significantly	 curtail	 carbon	 emissions	 by	
optimising their fuel consumption, ensuring that less fuel is employed 
to	produce	 an	equivalent	 amount	 of	electricity.	The	efficiency	 of	a	
thermal power plant is typically measured using a parameter called 
“heat	rate”	or	“thermal	efficiency”.	A	lower	heat	rate	indicates	a	more	
efficient	 power	plant	because	 it	means	that	less	fuel	is	required	 to	
produce each unit of electricity.
We continue to monitor and implement initiatives to improve thermal 
power	plant	efficiency,	aiming	to	sustain	the	efficiency	at	its	designed	
level.	Our	efforts	have	produced	a	commendable	enhancement	of	the	
efficiency	 (heat	rate)	of	thermal	 power	plants	 in	the	TNB	portfolio,	
registering an improvement of +1.12% from 2022 to 2023. The 
resulting carbon emissions reduction was 301 KtCO 2e.
With the myTNB mobile app, customers with smart meters are further 
empowered	to	embrace	an	 energy	 efficiency	 lifestyle	through	interactive	
energy	usage	alerts,	specifically	through	the	Energy	Budget	feature.	This

The Tenaga Safety Culture programme aims to inculcate safety as 
an	 integral	 part	 of	 everyday	 working	 culture,	 transforming	 it	 from	 a	
mere compliance activity. The programme is rooted in our four (4) core 
behaviours: “ Assess”, “Comply”, “Intervene” and “ Actively Caring”. 
Various	initiatives	have	been	rolled	out	to	foster	these	core	behaviours	
among all employees. Notably, a holistic approach, including spiritual 
considerations, has been embraced to align good safety practices with 
relevant religious teachings.
We continue to implement the Nampak, Dengar & Rasa Selamat (NDRS) 
programme to reinforce a strong HSE culture among all employees. 
The NDRS programme encourages employees to be sensitive to their 
surroundings,	 evaluate	 potential	 health	 and	 safety	 risks,	 comply	 with	
HSE	 requirements,	 and	 take	 proactive	 action	 to	 prevent	 risks	 from	
materialising.	 The	 NDRS	 framework	 focuses	 on	 three	 (3)	 elements	
- engineering, education and enforcement - and is supported 
by a consequence management process that rewards positive 
behaviour , encourages good practices and addresses non-compliance  
appropriately.
T enaga Safety Culture
In	 2023,	 the	 TNB	 Stop	 Work	 Policy	 and	 Intervensi	 Stop	 Work (ISW)  
guidelines were fully implemented. These authorise employees and 
contractors	to	perform	stop	work	intervention	 upon	encountering	 any	
unsafe	conditions	or	observing	unsafe	acts	at	the	workplace.
We continue to prioritise occupational health (OH) programmes 
that focus on Noise, Ergonomic and Chemical Management. In 2023, 
TNB actively participated in the Department of Occupational Safety 
and Health’s Systematic OH Enhancement Level Programme to 
drive occupational health compliance in our business operations.  
This programme elevates occupational health among our employees. 
In 2023, the number of instances of occupational diseases reduced to  
ten	(10)	confirmed	cases.

In 2023, 11 business operations and 45 individuals were awarded.
The biennial TNB safety culture assessment was conducted using the 
“Hearts	 and	Minds	 safety	 culture	 toolkit”	 methodology	 of	the	Energy	
Institute in the United Kingdom and showcased the progression of our 
safety culture to “Proactive”, from a score of 4.02 in 2021 to 4.16 in 2023.

In 2023, there were zero fatalities related to electrical accidents as 
compared to 2022 and 2021. However , we regretfully recorded four (4)  
non-electrical accident fatalities involving three (3) employees and one 
contractor resulting from motor vehicle accidents and hornet stings.  
We treat each incident with the utmost attention with thorough 
investigations and detailed analysis for corrective and preventive 
interventions at operations, Management and Board levels.
Following a fatality, immediate Stand Downs are implemented across 
the Group, led by Management, to alert our employees and contractors 
to prevent an occurrence of a similar nature. Incident Alert bulletins 
are disseminated to all employees to share immediate precautionary 
measures, while Iktibar Insiden bulletins are issued to share valuable 
lessons learnt from these unfortunate accidents. 
Our L TIFR demonstrated a substantial 33% reduction in 2023  
(L TIFR = 0.74) compared to 2021 (L TIFR = 1.03), a consistent improvement 
since	2018.	This	signified	that	there	was	less	time	lost	resulting	from	
work-related	injuries.
Health and Safety Performance
We leverage digitalisation to manage and centralise HSE data with the 
progressive rollout of modules for the holistic implementation of our 
eHSE online system. The TNB Safety Information System captures 
reports of incidents and near misses, and incidents are investigated 
to identify corrective and preventive actions to prevent recurrence.  
The HSE Wallet mobile application enables employees to record potential 
incidents,	stop	work	intervention	occurrences	and	good	safety	and	health	
practices across the Group. These digitalised platforms further inculcate 
our TNB Safety Culture.
Digitalisation as an Enabler
We place high importance on employee wellness. The TNB T otal 
Wellness	Programme	aims	to	educate	and	influence	employees	towards	
a	healthy	lifestyle	and	work-life	balance.	The	“Vibrant	Living	-	Healthier.
T ogether” initiative focuses on six (6) scopes, which are a healthy diet, no  
smoking/vaping,	 leading	an	active	lifestyle,	 weight	management,	 yearly	
basic health screening and mental well-being. “Wellness Wednesday” 
health	 talks	 and	awareness	 sessions	 are	conducted	 online	 weekly,	and	
open to all employees and retirees to increase awareness on common 
health issues and encourage healthier habits.
Three (3) Klinik TNB, located in TNB Platinum, Bangsar , DuaSentral, Kuala

safe,	 effective	 and	 reliable	 medical	 care	 to	our	 members	 (employees,	
retirees and their respective dependents). 1,276 panel hospitals and  
clinics are also available nationwide for easy accessibility to essential 
medical treatment and healthcare. In 2023, a new initiative, namely the 
Medication Delivery Service, was introduced to provide our members  
with	 a	 safe,	 reliable	 and	 cost-effective	supply	 of	 long-term	 chronic

SUST AINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MA TERIAL MA TTERS
At TNB, our dedication to responsible environmental management resonates through tangible actions and ongoing 
initiatives, particularly in the areas of emissions, biodiversity, waste management and water management. The 
Board and Management have set a clear tone regarding environmental management for the preservation and 
conservation of natural resources, which is reflected in the TNB Environmental Policy. Our core businesses are 
ISO 14001:2015 compliant in Environmental Management System and we are guided by the TNB Health, Safety and 
Environmental Management System, which outlines environmental risk identification and control requirements.

The	 Wastewater	 Treatment	 Plant	 employs	 sedimentation,	 filtration	
and chemical processes to eliminate pollutants. The Environmental 
Management System (ISO 14001) guides monitoring to ensure  
compliance	with	Environmental	Quality	(Industrial	 Effluent)	Regulations	
2009. While most plants adhere to Standard B limits, Sultan Ibrahim  
Power Plant (SPG) complies with the more stringent Standard A limit. 
We continue to implement other water reduction initiatives for power 
generation processes as follows:
Rainwater Harvesting 
We have embraced rainwater harvesting at TNB buildings for landscape 
irrigation and gardening which translates into a reduction of municipal 
water usage. This initiative is implemented at TNB Platinum T owers, Leo 
Moggie	Convention	Centre	and	Balai	Islam, Bangsar.	In	total,	the	rainwater	
harvesting system has a holding capacity of 308,500 litres. In our pursuit  
of sustainable practices, we have implemented the rainwater 
harvesting	system	at	TNB	Sepang	Solar	and	TNB	Bukit	Selambau	Solar,	 
which currently hold capacities of 24,000 litres and 1,000 litres 
respectively.
Boiler	 combustion	 tuning	 for	our	coal-fired	 boilers	 and	gas	
turbine tuning to optimise water circulation ratio and feed 
water consumption when consuming fuel of diverse quality

Continuous upgrade of high-pressure valve materials to sustain 
continuous	operation	at	zero	leak	and	passing	conditions
2
Pre-emptive thermography and thermal scanning before 
planned	outages	to	correctly	identify	and	replace	leaking	valves
4
Periodical inspection of condensers using both online and  
offline	methods	to	identify	and	reduce	condenser	tube	leak	
incidents

Improving feed water heaters and economiser temperatures by 
reducing	spray	water	cooling	upstream	of	the	condenser	neck
5
We	 are	 committed	 to	 effectively	 managing	 waste	 to	 reduce	 the	
adverse	effects	on	human	health	and	the	environment.	Hazardous	and	 
non-hazardous waste are two (2) primary types of waste generated in 
TNB, each demanding distinct handling and disposal strategies. 
Hazardous Waste
Our hazardous waste handling and disposal process is regulated by the 
Department of Environment (DOE) and governed by the Environmental 
Quality Act 1974. Our Scheduled Waste Roadmap 2018-2030 aims to 
strengthen hazardous waste management with a phased approach 
involving	all	employees	and	key	stakeholders. 	
Waste Management 
Closed-loop water usage for  
steam generation
Water usage for  
power plant cooling system
Water usage in our closed-loop steam generation 
process is relatively small, 1.87% to 3.08%, 
minimising our reliance on municipal water 
sources. Power plants continue to operate 
efficiently	 using	 the	 closed-loop	 steam	 
generation	processes	efficiently	to	reduce	water	
usage percentage through water treatment 
measures,	 blowdown	 minimisation	 and	 leak	
prevention
Our cooling process, facilitated through the open circuit Main Cooling 
Water	 system,	 operates	 efficiently	 by	 utilising	 seawater	 or	 river	
water	and	subsequently	discharging	it	back	into	the	sea	or	the	river	
at the regulated operating temperature. This ensures zero net water 
consumption while adhering to global water conservation standards 
set forth by the Electric Power Research Institute. Key parameters 
such as pH, temperature, oil and grease, total suspended solids, and 
specific	 contaminants	like	 heavy	metals	 are	 measured	 to	ensure	
compliance
We are prudent in utilising and managing water consumption. In 2023, we continued to leverage digitalisation by introducing the TNB Water Management 
Inventory	online	system	to	track	and	monitor	water	consumption	at	our	assets	to	progressively	enhance	data	collection.
In power generation operations 80% of water consumption is used for steam generation and power plant cooling systems. All our generating power 
assets	are	built	and	operated	in	accordance	with	global	World	Bank	Environmental	and	Social	Standards.

apart from a slight increase in temperature, subject to authorisation and continuous controls to guarantee the absence of measurable impacts on exposed ecosystems.
ii. Total water withdrawal is the sum of the various water resources obtained by direct measurement (flowmeters) or by estimating the output of the water withdrawal pumps.  
In TNB, most of the water withdrawn is used in cooling processes, especially in power generation. The rest of the water withdrawn corresponds to other auxiliary services of the

We actively engage in supporting livelihoods and elevating the economic and social quality of life for individuals within our communities.  
In 2023, we continued to refurbish and build new homes for underprivileged families amounting to RM0.2 million through our Homes for the Needy 
programme.
Home For the Needy
Through	the	Rural	Electrification	Programme	(Bekalan Elektrik Luar Bandar - BELB) carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of Rural and Regional 
Development, TNB facilitates electricity access in rural regions, encompassing villages and Indigenous People settlements situated beyond the 
operational reach of local authorities. Where feasible, we integrate these areas into our grid lines. In instances where settlements are too remote 
for	grid	line	connection,	we	deploy	off-grid	solutions,	including	solar	hybrids,	generator	sets	and	mini-hydro	systems.	In	2023,	we	enhanced	the	
connectivity to remote villages, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to extending power infrastructure to underserved areas.

Education
We actively engage with the Orang Asli communities who live near our operation sites with initiatives aiming at improving their well-being and 
socioeconomic conditions. For accessible education, TNB has set up a scholarship fund for underprivileged Orang Asli children, providing them with 
the opportunity to pursue their academic and career goals, and improving the standards of living of the recipients and their families in the long run. 
Various	engagement	activities	and	socioeconomic	resilience	programmes	were	also	conducted	to	foster	community	cohesion	and	well-being.	At	Pos	
T ohoi and Pos Pulat, Kelantan, for example, the following activities were carried out in 2023:

plan and manage our supply chain using advanced data analytics. With 
automated data integration, PCP enables real-time analysis, planning,

TNB recorded a substantial spending of approximately RM37 billion in 
2023.	The	spend	trend	reflects	a	growth	trajectory	as	Malaysia	recovers	
from the post-pandemic era; 46.45% of our expenditures in 2023 was 
awarded to local vendors and suppliers.
Approximately RM25 billion was fuel-related, mainly on fuel gas sourced 
locally and coal fuel sourced internationally from foreign suppliers to 
ensure suitable coal quality for coal power generation in Malaysia. Of the 
non-fuel spending of RM11.6 billion, approximately 91% was from local 
suppliers. 
We are dedicated to cultivating a supply chain ecosystem that meets and 
aspires to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and transparency. Our 
commitment to these principles ensures that our procurement practices 
contribute to establishing a sustainable and responsible business 
environment. 
Recognition
We	 continuously	 seek	 feedback	 from	 our	 vendors	 through	 an	 annual

As we focus on better customer experience through digitalisation, we continue to strategically safeguard our 
Information T echnology (IT) and Operational T echnology (OT) systems. Through these systems, we enable a 
reliable and secure supply of electricity to the nation. Our cybersecurity management aims to protect data 
confidentiality and integrity, as well as ensuring the availability of our critical IT and OT systems.
MM
10 Cybersecurity Management
We employ cloud services in our business operations, leveraging their 
scalability and accessibility advantages. T o ensure our data security 
and privacy are of the highest standards, we ensure that these service 
providers comply with related international standards, such as ISO/IEC 
27017, ISO/IEC 27018 and Service Organization Control T ype 2 (SOC 2). 
We	have	established	an	Enterprise	Data	Governance	(EDG)	framework	to	
ensure consistent management of information systems throughout the 
Group and for the safe handling of data sharing in compliance with the 
PDPA.
Being a responsible company that processes data for 10.14 million 
customers, a comprehensive process is in place to handle the potential 
loss of private customer data. Continuous data analysis is conducted to 
identify and rectify errors found in customer data in line with established 
policies and procedures. Other control measures include the utilisation of 
electronic Know Y our Customer and digital signature solutions. In 2023, a 
PDPA	e-learning	module	specifically	tailored	for	Retail	and	Small	Medium	
Enterprise and Residential employees was launched. 
The cybersecurity management of our Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) assets and services is governed by the TNB ICT Security 
Policy and ICT Code of Practice. The policy and code of practice ensure our 
employees are aware of their respective responsibilities and obligations in 
protecting	the	confidentiality,	integrity,	availability	and	authenticity	of	our	
ICT assets in the execution of day-to-day business operations. 
We	conduct	around-the-clock	monitoring	of	cyber	threats	to	our	systems	
to ensure the reliability of electricity supply and to protect company data, 
including the personal data of our customers. We are presently accredited 
with	globally	 recognised	 cybersecurity	 standards,	 specifically	 the	ISO/
IEC	27001:2013	Information	Security	Management	System	for	TNB’s	key	 
point installations and data centres. We also adopt IEC 62443 best 
practices that address cybersecurity mitigations for OT in automation 
and	control	systems.	Additionally,	we	are	certified	in	the	Payment	Card	
Industry Data Security Standard for payment card transactions to  
secure our payment gateways and mitigate potential data theft and fraud.
We	are	vigilant	in	our	efforts	to	protect	the	data	privacy	of	our	10.14	million	customers	from	unauthorised	access	and	use.	Our	efforts	include	robust	
initiatives	identified	in	our	cybersecurity	operating	model	and	compliance	with	regulations	such	as	the	Personal	Data	Protection	Act	(PDPA)	and	industry	
standards.

TNB firmly believes that every individual deserves equal opportunities and a supportive work environment.  
At TNB, we actively promote a culture of respect, understanding and acceptance.
MM
11 Employment Culture
We	strive	to	create	an	inclusive	workplace	where	all	employees	can	thrive	and	contribute	their	unique	perspectives	and	talents.	Reimagining	Culture	(RC)	
was	established	to	define	our	core	values	and	culture	-	Integrity,	Collaboration,	Professionalism,	Customer-centricity,	Forward	Thinking	and	Mindfulness	
- that drive our business transformation along with the development of a high-performance culture. As part of embracing Mindfulness, we are respectful 
and compassionate to others and the environment while protecting the safety and promoting the well-being of our people and the public.
TNB	is	dedicated	to	fostering	equal	opportunities	and	a	supportive	work	environment	for	every	individual.	We	actively	cultivate	a	culture	of	respect,	
understanding	and	acceptance,	striving	to	create	an	inclusive	workplace	where	all	employees	can	thrive,	bringing	their	unique	perspectives	and	talents	
to the forefront.
TNB remains steadfast in adhering to all relevant labour laws, supporting the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining as outlined in 
the	Collective	Agreement	(CA).	Both	executive	and	non-executive	employees’	rights	are	safeguarded	through	our	unions,	ensuring	improved	working	
conditions.	In	2023,	we	continued	to	engage	and	facilitate	 discussions	 to	address	employee	concerns,	enhance	workplace	culture,	align	with	the	
company’s direction and negotiate terms within the CA.
We	place	high	importance	on	ensuring	the	safety	of	our	employees	and	providing	them	with	a	safe	working	environment.	This	can	be	seen	clearly	 
through the improvement of our HSE performance in 2023, where we achieved our target of reducing our employee Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(L TIFR) to <1.00, recording an L TIFR of 0.74 compared to 0.82 in 2022.

Employee Learning and Development Journey
In ensuring that our people are equipped with the right capabilities, we continue to invest in our people. 
Our learning and development programmes are based on three (3) principles: 
Our succession management is a systematic process designed to identify, select and develop talents, ensuring a seamless operation of critical  
roles	within	our	company.	As	of	the	end	of	2023,	we	had	successfully	cultivated	31	“ready	now”	successors	out	of	the	34	identified	critical	positions.	
Notably,	our	newly	appointed	C-Suites	and	Senior	General	Managers	were	drawn	from	this	pool	of	successors.	This	achievement	was	acknowledged	
when	we	clinched	Gold	(first	place)	in	the	Best	Succession	Planning	Strategy	category	at	the	Employee	Experience	Awards	2023	Malaysia,	affirming	the	
effectiveness	of	our	strategic	approach	to	succession	planning.
The	 TNB	 Diversity	 &	 Inclusion	 policy,	 established	 in	 2022,	 highlights	 our	 steadfast	 dedication	 to	 nurturing	 a	 diverse	 and	 inclusive	 work	 
environment. We are committed to fostering a culture that values individuals irrespective of factors such as age, gender , race, religion, nationality, 
physical	abilities,	background	or	prior	experiences.	This	commitment	includes	striving	for	a	minimum	of	30%	female	representation	on	our	Board	of	
Directors	and	promoting	diversity	among	our	senior	management	team.	Our	workforce	comprises	a	mosaic	of	individuals	with	diverse	backgrounds,	
talents and expertise, all strategically aligned with the company’s objectives.
Moving forward, we are poised to introduce our comprehensive stance on labour rights. This initiative will employ a centralised and structured approach  
to	safeguard	the	labour	rights	of	our	employees,	emphasising	 key	aspects	such	as	diversity	and	inclusion,	 fair	wages	and	benefits,	upskilling	 and	 
education, equitable treatment, safety and health, anti-corruption measures and a resolute stance against forced labour .
This	empowers	our	employees	to	chart	their	competency	development	in	alignment	with	the	learning	journey	identified	for	their	respective	roles. 	
The	effectiveness	of	the	employees’	learning	journey	is	further	monitored	through	annual	assessment	cycles	to	gauge	their	proficiency	levels	over	time.	
Both the employees and management are given the platform to discuss and identify any further improvement areas, which are needed in supporting  
the energy transition agenda. Through this exercise, TNB achieved an Organisational Competency Index of 87.8% in 2023.

Extended Study Programmes 
Our employees are provided with the opportunity to further their academic studies through our study sponsorship initiative, which includes support for 
both	undergraduate	and	postgraduate	programmes.	Additionally,	we	offer	an	in-house	Employee	Academic	Development	Programme.	From	2021	to	
2023,	a	total	of	220	TNB	employees	actively	participated	in	these	programmes,	reflecting	our	commitment	to	their	continuous	learning	and	development.	
This initiative represents a substantial investment, totalling RM1.2 million.
In	summary,	we	continue	to	invest	in	our	workforce	capabilities: 	
Professional Certification 
The	technical	competencies	of	our	workforce	play	a	pivotal	role	in	driving	our	business	operations.	Our	employees	actively	pursue	relevant	professional	
and	specialist	 certifications	 within	their	respective	 fields.	Additionally,	they	are	encouraged	to	stay	abreast	of	up-to-date	industry	standards	and

OUR PERFORMANCE
In	2023,	we	were	steadfast	in	implementing	the	Group-wide	TNB	Ways	of	Working	(TWOW),	empowering	our	employees	to	adopt	a	hybrid	work	model,	
seamlessly	transitioning	either	working	in	the	office,	at	home	or	home-based.	This	approach	fosters	a	flexible	work	environment	that	prioritises	inclusivity,	
acknowledging	employees’	individual	needs	without	compromising	productivity	or	business	performance.	Our	implementation	of	TWOW	is	facilitated	
through	digitalisation,	particularly	through	the	use	of	the	People	app,	which	earned	us	the	prestigious	Gold	award	(first	place)	in	the	Best	Hybrid	Work	
Model category at the Employee Experience Awards 2023 Malaysia. Additionally, the app plays a pivotal role in facilitating reporting on GHG Scope 3 
emissions,	specifically	in	Category	6	(Business	Travel)	and	Category	7	(Employee	Commuting).
The TNB employee engagement survey, conducted annually, aims to provide insights into our strengths and areas for improvement to enhance the 
overall employee experience, with a focus on our corporate culture. In 2023, an impressive 90% of our employees participated in the survey, resulting in 
a	commendable	score	of	89%.	This	signifies	a	consistent	upward	trajectory	since	2021,	reaching	the	highest	recorded	score.	Notably,	this	achievement

TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD  Integrated Annual Report 2023

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO  
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE
Dear Shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Overview Statement for 2023.
In alignment with our Corporate Governance Report, accessible on our 
corporate website, these statements highlight the Board’s thorough 
assessment of the Group’s operational landscape and strategic decisions 
aimed at securing a sustainable position for the benefit of our key 
stakeholders. This effort is bolstered by our commitment to upholding 
exemplary standards of corporate governance, deeply embedded within 
our organisational ethos.
The effectiveness of the Board’s leadership is assessed by the 
transparency and clarity evident in our actions, underscored by the 
standards, procedures, and culture we establish. This transparent 
approach reflects our dedication to accountability and integrity across all 
aspects of our operations.
ENGAGING AND RECONNECTING
In the past year , TNB introduced TNB Ways of Working (TWoW) to 
foster a more conducive work environment and address the needs of 
our workforce. Three (3) key components of TWoW include flexible and 
hybrid working arrangements, adaptable work hours, and a smart casual 
dress code, which became effective across TNB as of 1 January 2023.  
This initiative aligns with TNB’s commitment to implementing flexible 
working practices throughout the organisation.
Further , we resumed hybrid meetings for the Board and its Committees, 
as well as for many shareholder engagements. The upcoming 2024 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) will be conducted virtually, and I eagerly anticipate 
connecting with those who are able to attend, while also addressing 
queries from those joining us virtually.
The Board places significant emphasis on gathering input from 
employees, shareholders and broader stakeholders to ensure our actions 
resonate with those we collaborate with. This commitment is evident 
throughout this Integrated Annual Report, showcasing the extensive 
network through which we gather pertinent insights. At the Board level, 
we enhance our understanding of various perspectives through initiatives 
that complement our daily interactions within our business operations.
Our Board agenda also encompasses a stakeholder evaluation of our 
strategic direction, an annual update on supply chains, confirmation of 
sustainability priorities, and a comprehensive report on key stakeholder 
engagements. Notably, in 2023, our discussions included the development 
of Reimagining TNB 2.0, the Board Evaluation Assessment and a review 
of Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration by independent expert and 
broader considerations regarding energy affordability.
DRIVING SUST AINABILITY 
Our operational strategy is deeply rooted in Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) principles, ensuring our enduring commitment to 
sustainable practices. ESG targets are seamlessly integrated into our 
performance metrics via an ESG scorecard, reflecting their pivotal role 
in driving organisational objectives. Continuously striving for excellence, 
we’ve enhanced our reporting standards to align with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) index and T ask Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.
The robust support from our Board Committees further showcases our 
dedication to sustainability. The renaming of the Board Risk Committee 
(BRC) to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC), effective 
25 August 2023, signals our heightened emphasis on sustainability. 
Collaborating closely with the BSRC, the Board assumes responsibility 
for overseeing the strength of our sustainability and risk management 
frameworks, ensuring effective implementation to achieve strategic 
objectives and sustainability commitments.
Simultaneously, the Sustainability and Energy T ransition Council (SETC) 
intensifies our focus on ESG index performance and scrutinises climate 
resilience and adaptation plans, further bolstering our commitment 
to sustainable practices. Moreover , the Board’s endorsement of 
enhancements to the terms of reference of the Board Audit Committee 
(BAC), with a particular focus on sustainability-related matters, 
underscores our proactive approach. 
For a comprehensive overview of our ESG initiatives and activities over 
the past year , please refer to the dedicated section titled “Sustainability 
Statement” within this report. Detailed information regarding our 
approach to ESG can also be found in our standalone Sustainability 
Report. These documents provide valuable insights into our ongoing 
commitment to sustainability and the measures we undertake to uphold  
ESG principles.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE
EFFECTIVENESS  
In my capacity as Chairman, I bear the responsibility and shall persist 
in providing leadership to ensure the effective operation of the Board.  
I am fortunate to have the support of all Directors in this endeavour .  
The annual Board Evaluation Assessment (BEA) serves as a valuable tool  
for the Board to reflect on its functioning and identify areas for 
enhancement. This year , the BEA was conducted by an independent 
expert in accordance with Practice 6.1 of the Malaysian Code on  
Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG). The findings from this assessment 
have yielded valuable insights that will guide us in further refining the 
operations and effectiveness of the Board. 
BOARD CHANGES 
The Board is committed to maintaining a diverse mix of skills, experience 
and expertise to effectively fulfill its responsibilities and address the 
dynamic landscape ahead. With a keen eye on succession planning, 
we have established a robust process for selecting, nominating and 
appointing candidates to the Board.
Entrusted with this responsibility, the Board Nomination and  
Remuneration Committee (BNRC) rigorously evaluates potential 
candidates, considering their capabilities, commitment and suitability 
for Board and Committee roles. This evaluation encompasses a 
range of factors, including diversity, skillsets, backgrounds, relevant  
experience and fit and proper assessment, ensuring a well-rounded 
composition of Board members.
In line with our governance framework, the Board may appoint new 
Directors to fill vacancies or augment the existing Board structure. As 
per our Company’s Constitution, the Minister of Finance (Incorporated) 
(MoF Inc.), our Special Shareholder , holds the authority to appoint up to 
six (6) Directors. Currently, our Board comprises 12 members, including 
one (1) Executive Director and 11 Non-Executive Directors, with six (6)
Independent Directors.
These Independent Directors bring unbiased judgment, free from 
any conflicts of interest, ensuring robust decision-making processes.  
We continue to refine our Board composition, balancing experience, 
expertise and innovative perspectives.
Several changes have occurred within the Board during the reporting 
period. Prior to the commencement of the 33 rd Annual General Meeting 
on 18 May 2023, Datuk Rawisandran Narayanan expressed his intention, 
not to seek for re-election as an Independent Non-Executive Director , as 
per Clause 64(1) of the Company’s Constitution. Consequently, Ordinary 
Resolution 3 regarding his re-election as a Director was withdrawn at the 
AGM.
In the course of the Financial Year , Muazzam bin Mohamad assumed the  
role of Non-Independent Non-Executive Director , representing 
Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), a major shareholder of TNB, 
effective 1 July 2023. With over 15 years of experience at PNB, Muazzam 
has spearheaded numerous initiatives in corporate finance, mergers 
and acquisitions and corporate strategy, emphasising sustainability 
and governance. His appointment underscores our commitment to 
responsible investment practices.
Shortly thereafter , Datuk Amran Hafiz bin Affifudin resigned as  
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director , representing Khazanah 
Nasional Berhad (Khazanah), a major shareholder of TNB, effective  
1 September 2023. Concurrently, Elaine Ong Yee Lynn concluded 
her role as Alternate Director to Datuk Amran Hafiz bin Affifudin, 
as stipulated in Clause 61(2) of the Company’s Constitution. 
Selvendran Katheerayson was subsequently appointed as  
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director , representing Khazanah, 
effective 1 September 2023.
Selvendran brings a wealth of experience from his tenure as 
Executive Director , Head of Real Assets & Property at Khazanah. His 
appointment reflects our commitment to strengthening governance  
and maximizing shareholder value. Elaine Ong Yee Lynn was reappointed 
as Alternate Director to Selvendran Katheerayson with effect from  
24 November 2023.
Furthermore, upon the conclusion of Dato’ Seri Ir . Baharin bin Din’s service 
tenure as President/Chief Executive Officer (President/CEO), Datuk Ir . 
Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan was appointed by the Board with 
the concurrence of MoF Inc. as President/CEO and Non-Independent 
Executive Director of TNB for a two-year term, effective 1 March 2024. 
Datuk Ir . Megat Jalaluddin brings extensive experience and industry 
knowledge, having served in various leadership capacities within TNB.
The Board on 27 February 2024 had approved the appointment of  
Ramzi bin Mansor who is the Deputy Secretary General 
of T reasury (Management) in the Ministry of Finance as  
Non-Independent Non-Executive Director representing the interest 
of MoF Inc. with effect from 1 March 2024. He was appointed in place of  
Datin Rashidah binti Mohd Sies, who had resigned effective  
12 January 2024, due to her retirement in public services.
A recent addition to the Board is the appointment of Dato’ Zulkifli 
bin Ibrahim as Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from  
1 April 2024. He possesses technical expertise and experience in 
generation operation and maintenance, that would fill up the gap  
identified through the Board Skills Matrix.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION TO
CORPORA TE GOVERNANCE
As we welcome our new Board members and leadership, we express our 
gratitude to departing Directors for their dedication and service to the 
Company. We are confident that with the collective expertise and vision 
of our Board, we will continue to steer TNB towards success, creating  
long-term value for our stakeholders.
The Board adheres to Paragraph 15.02 (1)(a)&(b) of the Main Market  
Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (MMLR), of 
having 50% of Independent Directors and five (5) female Directors, 
surpassing the requirements set by the MMLR.
The Board and BNRC continuously undertake thorough reviews of the 
Board Skills Matrix. This assessment aids in identifying the necessary 
skills, knowledge, experience and capabilities essential for addressing 
current and future challenges within the Company. It aims to maintain a 
well-rounded mix of expertise to effectively tackle business compliance 
and governance matters, thereby enabling Directors to conduct 
comprehensive evaluations of Management’s performance.
Following the BNRC’s recommendation, the Board approved measures 
to enhance the Board’s composition for greater dynamism. Addressing 
critical skills and competency gaps, such as technical proficiency, 
international business acumen and customer-centricity, remains a priority. 
All Directors appointed during the Financial Year under review possess the 
requisite skills, aligning with the strategic needs of the Company.
DA TO’ ABDUL RAZAK BIN ABDUL MAJID 
Chairman
LOOKING FORWARD 
In conclusion, the importance of robust corporate governance cannot be underestimated as we chart our course forward. Serving as the bedrock 
of our operations, it steers us towards enduring growth and prosperity. As we progress, our focus remains on strengthening our governance 
mechanisms, continuously refining and adapting them to meet the evolving needs of our organisation and the expectations of our stakeholders. By 
aligning our governance practices with our strategic and operational objectives, we not only bolster the confidence of our investors and partners 
but also cultivate an environment of accountability and transparency. This dedication to sound corporate governance ensures that we remain 
committed to delivering long-term, sustainable value for all those we serve.
By having a balanced blend of skills, experience, knowledge and 
independence, the Board is confident in its ability to execute the Group’s 
strategy effectively. This balance empowers the Non-Executive Directors 
to rigorously challenge Management’s perspectives and proposals while 
ensuring compliance with the principle of good governance.
DIVERSITY 
The Board remains deeply committed to promoting diversity within the 
Company’s senior management. It conducts annual reviews to evaluate 
recommendations on diversity for these crucial roles. Recognising the 
continuous need for advancement, this commitment extends beyond the 
Board level to include the Senior Leadership tier .
Presently, the representation of women on the Board stands at five 
(5) members, constituting 42%, surpassing the 30% benchmark 
recommended by the MCCG. However , within the broader organisation, 
women comprise 21% of the workforce. Gender balance varies across 
roles, geographies, and bands with female representation within our 
leadership stands at 26%.
Although commendable progress has been achieved in different aspects 
of diversity and inclusion across the Group, ensuring sustainable change 
requires a resolute, long-term strategy, which remains a key focus for the 
Company.

SUMMARY OF BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2023
MA TTERS DELIBERA TED BY THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023
The following list is not exhaustive and encompasses only a selection of Key Areas of Focus/Matters Deliberated by the Board and its Committees 
during the Financial Year . It aims to offer stakeholders a glimpse into some of the significant matters deliberated by the Board:
SUST AINABILITY GOVERNANCE 
In advancing our sustainability agenda and achieving our net zero 
objectives, a robust sustainability governance framework and resolute 
leadership structure are paramount. Aligned with the tenets of the MCCG, 
our sustainability governance is deeply ingrained within TNB’s Governance 
Model, serving as a cornerstone of our organisational principles.
Underlining the importance of a resilient sustainability governance 
framework, coupled with effective leadership, we uphold these elements 
as essential for informed and inclusive decision-making processes. 
Integrated seamlessly within the broader TNB Group Governance 
Platform, our sustainability governance framework is intricately linked 
with TNB’s management committees and subcommittees, reinforcing its 
pivotal role within our corporate governance framework.
During a special meeting on 11 September 2023, the Board approved 
the renaming of the BRC to the BSRC, effective from 25 August 2023. 
This decision was accompanied by enhanced terms of reference, 
encompassing the oversight of sustainability practices in alignment with 
the Bursa Malaysia Sustainability Reporting Guide 3 rd Edition. With the 
support of the BSRC, the Board assumes responsibility for ensuring the 
robustness of our sustainability and risk management frameworks, as 
well as the effectiveness of their implementation in achieving strategic 
objectives and sustainability commitments.
For more information, please refer to Sustainability Governance section of 
Sustainability Statement, which can be found on pages 58-59.
Furthermore, on 14 December 2023, the Board endorsed the 
revised terms of reference for the BAC to adapt to its evolving role, 
particularly in providing assurance on sustainability-related matters. 
The updated functions and responsibilities of the BAC in relation to 
sustainability matters include ensuring the consistency and coherence of  
sustainability-related disclosures across financial reporting and other

Statement on Risk Management and Internal 
Control, which encapsulates Management’s

Indicators (KRIs) aligned with the BSRC’s and 
Management’s risk appetite.

Risk Officer and the Risk Management 
Department (RMD) in fulfilling its duties. The 
RMD ensures the effective implementation of 
the TNB Risk Management Framework, aligned 
with ISO 31000:2018, to facilitate informed 
decision-making.
With the establishment of the Sustainability 
Division during the Financial Year , tasked with 
executing TNB’s ESG Sustainability Initiative 
Strategy, the RMD now reports directly to the 
BSRC, with administrative reporting to the 
Chief Sustainability Officer . This integration 
ensures alignment between risk management 
and sustainability efforts.
A significant event during the year was the 
TNB T op Management Risk Forum, organised 
by the RMD under the theme “Building 
TNB Resiliency through Effective Risk 
Management.” Attended by BSRC members, 
the Group Executive Management Committee, 
and Senior Management, the forum aimed to 
cascade BSRC’s risk management directives 
to TNB’s senior leadership, fostering a robust 
risk culture across the Group.
The BSRC remains committed in its oversight 
role, ensuring that risk management is 
seamlessly integrated into strategic planning 
and decision-making processes to drive the 
Group’s strategic outcomes and long-term 
objectives. 
Based on the evaluation for the Financial Year 
under review, the Board collectively agreed 
thatit has discharged its roles in identifying 
principal risks and in ensuring that the Group 
has put in place an adequate risk management 
framework to effectively monitor and manage 
the risks of its operational businesses.

bin Ibrahim shall retire at the forthcoming AGM in accordance with Clause 
63(2) of the Company’s Constitution and being eligible, have offered 
themselves for re-election. 
Datuk Ir . Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan and Ramzi bin Mansor are 
Appointed Directors of MoF Inc. while Selvendran Katheerayson and 
Muazzam bin Mohamad represent Khazanah and PNB respectively.
In addition, all retiring Directors have declared that they did not have 
any existing or potential conflict of interest including any interest in any 
competing business within the Company or its subsidiaries that could 
affect the execution of their roles as Company Directors. 
Having considered their fit and proper assessment including declaration 
of conflict of interest, due diligence for the newly appointed Directors, 
professionalism, vast experience, material relationship, competency, 
commitment and individuals’ contributions in performing their respective 
duties, the Board and the BNRC are satisfied that all Directors who are 
standing for re-election at the 34 th AGM have met the Board’s expectation 
by continuously discharging their duties diligently as Company Directors. 
With that, upon the BNRC’s assessment, the Board resolved to support 
and recommend the re-election of each Director who is retiring at the 
upcoming 34th AGM.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Clause 64(1) of the Company’s Constitution provides, among others, that 
one-third (1/3) of the Directors at the time being of whom have been 
longest in office shall retire by rotation at the AGM of the Company and 
shall be eligible for re-election. 
Clause 63(2) of the Company’s Constitution provides, among others, 
that the Directors shall have power at any time and from time to time to 
appoint any other person to be a Director of the Company either to fill a 
casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director 
so appointed shall hold office only until the next following AGM of the 
Company and shall then be eligible for re-election. 
Ong Ai Lin and Dato’ Roslina binti Zainal are retiring by rotation in 
accordance with Clause 64(1) of the Company’s Constitution and being 
eligible, have offered themselves for re-election. 
The Board recognises that the Directors’ performance are used as 
basis in recommending their re-election to the shareholders. This, in 
turn, is determined through their annual evaluation and independence  
assessment, which were assessed by the BNRC before any 
recommendation was made to the Board for deliberation and approval. 
Based on the annual independence assessment undertaken by both Ong 
Ai Lin and Dato’ Roslina binti Zainal who are retiring at the coming AGM, 
the BNRC/Board are satisfied that these Independent Directors have 
complied with the independence criteria as prescribed by the MMLR and 
continue to bring independent and objective judgement to the Board.

DIRECTORS’ DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION
In supporting the Board’s responsibilities, a comprehensive training and 
development programme is extended to all Directors, with the assessment 
of training needs embedded within the Board evaluation procedure. This 
programme encompasses regular presentations from Management and 
informal meetings, fostering a profound understanding of the business, 
sector dynamics, and areas acknowledged for their technical complexity. 
The training initiatives aim to not only deepen comprehension but also 
endow Non-Executive Directors with insights into how TNB’s practices 
compared with those of its peers.
A robust induction programme is crafted for all new Directors, featuring 
tailored components such as meetings with T op Management, site 
visits and briefings on key operational matters, Board procedures, 
and governance issues. Ensuring a cohesive knowledge base, existing 
Directors, including the Alternate Director , had attended the Mandatory 
Accreditation Programme Part I (in relation to a Director’s roles, duties  
and liabilities) (MAP Part I). In addition, all existing Directors had 
attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme Part II in relation to  
sustainability and the related roles of a Director (MAP Part II). 
The newly appointed Directors namely Datuk Ir . Megat Jalaluddin bin 
Megat Hassan, Ramzi bin Mansor and Dato’ Zulkifli bin Ibrahim shall 
attend the MAP Part I and MAP Part II respectively within the timeframe  
as stipulated in Paragraph 15.08 and Practice Note 5 of the MMLR.
Facilitating the Board in organising both internal and external  
programmes and seminars relevant to Directors’ needs is a responsibility 
shouldered by the Company Secretary’s Office. This includes the annual 
in-house Board Development Programme (BDP), an integral component 
of TNB’s ongoing Board Continuing Development Programme.
BDP 2023 was held in collaboration with Messrs. PricewaterhouseCoopers 
P LT Malaysia, led by its Sustainability and Climate Change team with 
the theme “ Awareness on Sustainability Reporting for the Board of  
Directors”. It was held on 8 September 2023 at Pusat Konvensyen Leo 
Moggie, TNB Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, 59100 Kuala Lumpur and 
attended by the Board and T op Management. The topic was relevant as it 
discussed on Sustainability Reporting Landscape for Corporate Malaysia, 
customised for TNB’s Board of Directors. 
Prior to that, the Integrity Department, assisted by the Company 
Secretary’s Office, organised a specific programme, “The Law Behind 
Corporate Governance“ by Malaysian Institute Of Corporate Governance 
(MICG) on 4 September 2023 at M Resort & Hotel Kuala Lumpur for the 
Board and T op Management to keep abreast with the principles and best 
practices of corporate governance. This was in line with the TCP 2023 
approved by the BIC, which required Integrity Department to organise 
specific training for the Board and T op Management once in the third 
quarter of 2023. 
Apart from the BDP 2023, the Company Secretary’s Office in collaboration 
with Asia School of Business on 20 November 2023 held a Continuous 
Development Programme for the T op Management and TNB Subsidiaries’ 
Board Of Directors on “What Amount T o A Conflict Of Interest By 
Directors”. This capability-building initiative specially designed to provide 
TNB Nominee Directors with the necessary support to enhance their 
governance skill, proficiency and governing approach to enable them to 
act accordingly within the powers bestowed on them in the best interest 
of the Company and in good faith. It was also to address the enhancement 
to Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosures made by Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad in order to improve the quality of COI disclosures of Directors and 
key senior management and to promote better corporate governance 
practices and accountability.

BOARD EVALUA TION
Acknowledging the transformative potential of an objective and  
well-managed board evaluation process, the Board acknowledges 
its pivotal role in enhancing Board effectiveness, thereby delivering 
substantial benefits to the Company. This commitment is manifested 
through annual performance evaluations, thoughtfully designed  
induction programs for new Board members and a continuous stream of 
Board development activities.
In 2023, the Board with the assistance of BNRC, had engaged an 
Independent Expert for Board Evaluation Assessment FY2023 in support 
of Practice 6.1 of MCCG whereby for Large Companies, the Board 
engages independent expert at least every three (3) years, to facilitate 
objective and candid board evaluations. The last assessment carried out 
by the independent expert was in 2021. This strategic approach aims to 
facilitate impartial and candid Board evaluations, fostering a culture of  
transparency and accountability within the organisation.
2023 BOARD EVALUA TION ASSESSMENT RESUL TS 
The 2023 BEA included, but not limited to the following areas:
 
• Board leadership and roles 
• Board composition, skills and development 
• Board governance and processes 
• Board dynamics and culture 
• Board and Management relationship/Stakeholders’ engagement 
• Board & support functions 

---- Page 162 ----
TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD  Integrated Annual Report 2023

The 2023 BEA was conducted through questionnaires via Online 
Survey System. The questionnaires for the 2023 BEA comprised the 
Board, Board Committees Effectiveness Assessment, Directors and 
Board Committee members’ Self and Peer Assessment (SPA), as well 
as a 360 Degree Assessment by T op Management. In addition, the 
newly Appointed Directors had also completed online Saville Wave  
Assessments to understand their respective and collective stewardship 
styles and one-on-one online/physical interview sessions were  
conducted with all Directors. 
The overall effectiveness of the Board is assessed in the areas of  
Corporate Strategy and Direction Setting, Board Governance and 
Oversight, Board Composition, Boardroom Conduct and Dynamics, Board 
Management and Operation as well as its Key Priorities as well as the 
effectiveness of the Chairman. 
The assessment of individual Directors’ contribution and performance is 
conducted based on performance criteria of which among others are as 
follows:
• will and ability to critically challenge and ask the right questions; 
• confidence to stand up for a point of view and offer advice/guidance; 
• character and integrity in dealing with potential conflict of interest 
situations; 
• calibre and personality; 
• commitment to serve the Company; 
• due diligence and integrity; 
• fit and properness; 
• independence and objectivity; 
• skills and competencies; and 
• contribution and performance. 
The BEA also included the evaluation of dynamics and culture of the Board 
especially new Directors’ impact to the overall leadership and risk profile 
balance. The effectiveness of Board Committees is assessed in terms 
of structure and processes, accountabilities and responsibilities and 
its dynamic/composition as well as the effectiveness of the Chairmen 
of respective Board Committees. The SPA for the Board Committee 
members is similar to the Directors’ SPA, which is intended to assess  
their contribution, performance, calibre and personality in relation to 
the skills, experience and other qualities they bring to the Board/Board 
Committees. 
The SPA also examines the ability of each Board or Committee member to 
give input at meetings and to demonstrate a high level of professionalism 
and integrity in the decision-making process. It also takes into account 
the ability of each individual member to exercise independent judgement 
and demonstrate objectivity and clarity of thought on issues during 
deliberations at meetings, provide logical honest opinion and offer 
practical and realistic advice to the discussions. 
The feedback from the T op Management was also being sought via the  
360 Degree Assessment questionnaires and interviews. The  
Management’s feedback on the Board’s role and the extent of  
collaboration between the Board and Management in certain focus areas 
and in the review/decision-making process are useful for the Board’s 
consideration in enhancing its overall effectiveness. 
Based on the 2023 BEA results, the Board demonstrated solid  
performance with an overall rating of 4.3 across various effectiveness 
indicators, including Corporate Strategy & Direction Setting, Board 
Governance & Oversight, Board Composition, Boardroom Conduct & 
Dynamics, and Board Management & Operations. Peer assessments 
further underscored the Directors’ performance with a notable average 
score of 4.6, indicating that each Director was generally effective in 
dispensing his/her responsibilities. 
Building upon the insights from the 2022 BEA, the Board continued to 
showcase strong and effective leadership in 2023. It was highlighted by 
both the Board and Management that there was a clear distinction of 
roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and President/CEO, signalling 
robust and effective leadership in guiding the Company’s direction. Dato’ 
Abdul Razak bin Abdul Majid was rated as a highly effective Chairman 
demonstrating decisiveness and an action-oriented approach while 
creating an open and consultative environment within the Board and 
effectively delegating responsibilities to Directors, Board Committees 
and Management. 
The Board was seen to be effective in ensuring the integrity of the 
Company is aligned with regulatory requirements, internal standards 
and best practices. The Board was committed to its fiduciary duties 
and assumed the core responsibilities of reviewing and monitoring the 
Group’s strategic plan, overseeing and evaluating the conduct of the 
Group’s business and establishing sound risk management and internal 
control frameworks for the Group.
Moving forward, the Board recognises the need to establish a clear and 
well-defined succession plan for both the Board and T op Management, 
ensuring that the composition, structure and diversity is in line with TNB’s 
strategic direction. Additionally, the Board recognises the necessity of 
refining processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of both the 
Board and its Committees, actively seeking opportunities for continuous 
improvement.

T op Management’s remuneration package comprises three (3) distinct 
components: the base salary, fixed allowances and benefits, the Short 
Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (L TIP). The base 
salary is set competitively, considering the scope of work, experience, and 
anticipated performance. Fixed allowances are separate from the base 
salary and are granted for specific cash benefits.
The STI, contingent on annual performance, is disbursed as bonuses, 
contingent upon the Company’s profitability and the performance of 
T op Management. Evaluation criteria include quantitative targets and 
qualitative alignment with the Company’s values. The L TIP is designed 
to retain and reward T op Management, aligning their interests with the  
long-term success of the Company.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TOP MANAGEMENT REMUNERA TION
The compensation structure for the Executive Director is designed 
to correlate rewards with both corporate and individual performance. 
It encompasses salary, allowances, bonuses, and customary benefits 
aligned with industry standards. A significant part of the Executive 
Director’s compensation is variable and contingent upon annual 
performance against individual KPIs embedded in a scorecard aligned with  
Board-approved corporate objectives. Notably, the Executive Director 
abstains from participating in discussions and voting on his remuneration 
during Board meetings.
The BNRC conducts an annual review of the Executive Director’s 
performance, submitting informed views and recommendations to the 
Board regarding potential adjustments in remuneration or rewards, 
reflecting the Executive Director’s contributions to the Group’s 
achievements for the year .

TNB places a strong emphasis on a performance-driven culture, where 
the remuneration policy aims to compensate competitively for sustained 
performance, aligning with shareholders’ interests. The Company, in 
adherence to Practice 8.2 of the MCCG, opts not to disclose specific 
components of T op Management’s remuneration, citing potential 
disadvantages to the Company’s business interests. Further details can 
be found in the Corporate Governance Report.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERA TION
Non-Executive Directors receive compensation in the form of fixed 
monthly fees, meeting allowances and benefits-in-kind, covering items 
such as the reimbursement of utilities bills and business peripherals.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is calibrated to address 
the current challenging landscape in fulfilling their fiduciary duties, roles, 
and responsibilities. The remuneration structure takes into account 
the intricacies of the Company’s operations and the industry at large. 
Notably, the remuneration and benefits for Non-Executive Directors have 
remained consistent since 2013. 
The Board in 2023 had engaged an independent expert to conduct a  
holistic and independent review of the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration with the view to determine its market competitiveness  
and alignment with the latest regulations/corporate governance 
guidelines in Malaysia. The selected peer group used for benchmarking 
for this year’s study was chosen based on a set of guiding principles that 
was consistent with the previous study, that consist of the top largest 
companies by market capitalisation. 
The key principles used in determining the appropriate remuneration 
framework for the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration, among others 
were to reflect the complexity, responsibility and accountability of the 
roles with increasing regulatory demands of Bursa Malaysia and Securities 
Commission, TNB’s national importance, the competitiveness to attract 
and retain the talent profiles and to reflect the time and effort dedicated 
of their roles on the Board and Board Committees.
Based on the findings, TNB’s Directors’ fee competitiveness would be 
between the P50 and P75 of the market. Subsequently, the Board/BNRC 
agreed to retain the existing Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration and 
it is to be reviewed in three (3) years’ time.

In 2017, TNB was one of the first listed corporation to embark on the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) certification. T owards 
achieving the certification, TNB launched the TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) to drive an integrity-based culture and a high level of 
compliance with local and international anti-bribery standards. On 15 November 2018, TNB was awarded with the ABMS Certification from SIRIM and to 
further reinforce this culture, launched the TCIMS Handbook. TNB has a well thought out set of Shared Values made publicly available and communicated 
to the workforce. First among the TNB Shared Values is Integrity. The three (3) behaviours of Integrity are:
The TCIMS covers four (4) main policies, namely the Anti-Bribery Policy; 
the Gifts, Hospitality and Related Benefits Policy; the Conflicts of Interest 
Policy; and the Whistleblowing Policy. 
In 2022, TNB reviewed these four (4) main policies to reflect the current 
policies, circulars and practices. 
During the Financial Year under review, surveillance audits by SIRIM 
were conducted involving the Retail Division and four (4) wholly-owned 
subsidiaries of TNB, namely Malaysia T ransformer Manufacturing  
Sdn. Bhd. (MTM), TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS),  
TNB Fuel Services Sdn. Bhd. (TNBF) and TNB Repair and Maintenance 
Sdn. Bhd. (REMACO). There were two (2) recertification audits by 
SIRIM conducted for Procurement & Supply Chain Division (P&SC) and 
a subsidiary of TNB, Tenaga Cable Industries Sdn. Bhd. (TCI). All the  
entities successfully retained the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management 
System certification by SIRIM. 
In 2022, TNB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the 
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and signed the Corruption 
Free Pledge. This pledge emphasises the pledges and promises made 
by the leadership of TNB and its staff voluntarily in their capacity as an 
organisation to ensure that each of us will be more responsible in carrying 
out our duties and curbing corruption.
TNB has conducted the Integrity Health Survey in 2023 through UNITEN 
R & D Sdn. Bhd. where 25,680 staff have participated and based on the 
survey TNB received a 87.16% score as opposed 79.36% in 2022. TNB 
has also established a systematic approach through the Annual T raining 
and Communication Plan (TCP) for the areas of improvement identified 
through the Integrity Health Survey conducted in 2022. 
In 2023, all activities under the TCP were successfully completed including 
Seminar for Boards and T op Management. A series of trainings and 
awareness sessions were conducted by Integrity Department to better 
equip the Company in line with the implementation of Section 17A of the 
MACC Act 2009. These included the following:
• TNB Integrity Day 2023 
• Related programs to Divisions/Departments and Subsidiaries
• Five (5) sessions of Fraud and Bribery Risk Management workshop
• All staff and active vendors/contractors were required to complete 
Integrity E-Learning
• All staff are required to sign the integrity pledge, declare any conflicts 
of interest annually and specifically when a conflict arises 
• Joint integrity programs with MACC
• Published 12 Integrity bulletins and e-poster
LIMITS OF AUTHORITY
The Limits of Authority lays down guiding principles governing  
decision-making throughout the Group, emphasizing the escalation and 
reporting procedures to the Board. Delegating authority is a key aspect, 
with the Board entrusting the President/CEO and other Executives to 
oversee the Company’s day-to-day activities. This delegation includes 
the responsibility to recommend and approve both monetary and  
non-monetary limits of authority for operational and management 
decisions before execution. The Limits of Authority strikes a balance 
between effective oversight and empowering the Management with 
appropriate accountability.
CODE OF ETHICS FOR DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors adheres to the Code of Ethics for Company 
Directors established by the Companies Commission of Malaysia. Each 
Non-Executive Director is equipped with the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Handbook, serving as a reference for their professional responsibilities 
and the terms and conditions of their service. This handbook undergoes 
regular updates to reflect changes in applicable rules, regulations, and 
policies governing Directors’ conduct.
CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS (COBE)
EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT
We uphold the highest ethical standards and 
do what is right, all the time
We are fair , honest and transparent in 
everything we do
We always seek to achieve mutual benefit for 
the country, Company and customers
3 BEHAVIOURS OF INTEGRITY
TNB has developed the new COBE to govern the conduct of all Directors 
and employees which take effect on 25 August 2023. This code ensures 
adherence to laws and regulations, promotes sound employment 
practices, upholds confidentiality and privacy, and addresses matters  
such as conflicts of interest, business courtesies, and the proper use of 
TNB’s assets. It also outlines how TNB engages with its shareholders, 
employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it 
operates, emphasizing general principles of business integrity. All 
employees are expected to conduct business in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations, contributing to the enhancement and 
protection of TNB’s reputation.
In 2023, TNB launched the Code of Business  
Ethics (COBE) and Organisational  
Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) to strengthen  
the practice of integrity in TNB.

The Procurement Code of Conduct serves as a guiding framework for 
TNB’s Directors and employees, as well as suppliers/contractors and 
their personnel. TNB places a strong emphasis on principles such as 
integrity, accountability, fairness, and a zero-tolerance approach towards 
bribery and corruption in all supplier/contractor relationships. This 
code undergoes regular revisions to align with changes in regulations, 
reputational demands, and evolving business challenges.
Additionally, the Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures 
provide comprehensive guidance for executing procurement within TNB. 
This policy framework enables TNB to achieve optimal value, adopt leading 
business practices, prioritise business objectives, add value to customers, 
and maintain high standards of corporate governance. Both TNB’s COBE 
and Procurement Code of Conduct are accessible on the respective 
sections of the Company’s website at www.tnb.com.my. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (COI)
In upholding principles of ethical and independent decision-making and 
the enhancement to the existing COI disclosures as required by the  
MMLR, the Directors and T op Management are required to disclose on the 
nature and extent of any COI or potential COI, including interest in any 
competing business that the person has with TNB and its subsidiaries. 
Directors or T op Management with such interests are required to declare 
them immediately and at the respective meetings to be abstained from 
participating in the deliberations, in ensuring impartial decision-making. 
Mitigation actions shall be taken upon any declaration of COI by the 
Directors or T op Management, with the concurrence of the President/
CEO/Chairman/Senior Independent Director . In addition, TNB Directors, 
T op Management and its Boards of Subsidiaries are required to make 
COI declaration annually and on adhoc basis. Currently the Integrity 
Department, Company Secretary’s Office, Legal Services Department 
and Internal Audit Department are jointly developing the COI guidelines/
framework in ensuring it fulfills the enhancement to the existing COI 
disclosures as prescribed by the MMLR.
As practice by the Procurement & Supply Chain Division in collaboration 
with the Integrity Department, each Director shall sign an Integrity 
Pledge during every BTC/Board meeting. This commitment entails a 
declaration of any interests related to procurement or matters on the 
meeting agenda, underscoring the Company’s dedication to preventing  
corruption, mitigating conflicts of interest and safeguarding the 
confidentiality of information.
WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE
The Whistleblowing Procedure underscores TNB’s commitment to 
fostering an open working environment, where employees, contractors 
and members of the public can confidentially report instances of unethical, 
unlawful or undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal. 
An independent investigation team examines all reported concerns and 
where applicable, offers feedback on the outcome of the investigation.
The objectives of the Whistleblowing Procedure are threefold:
• T o identify and address unacceptable conduct.
• T o cultivate a supportive working environment that empowers 
employees and contractors to raise legitimate concerns with both 
personal and organisational implications.
• T o safeguard individuals who, in good faith, report unacceptable 
conduct from any adverse consequences.
Reporting channels are made easily accessible through the Online 
Whistleblowing Information System (WBIS) at http:/ /wbis.tnb.com.my.

officers using the Whistleblowing Complaint Form, available in both Malay 
and English.

ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY
TNB is resolute in articulating its position on bribery and related matters, 
establishing essential pillars within its framework to fortify the Company 
against any manifestation of bribery. All forms of bribery related to TNB’s 
activities are unequivocally prohibited. Upholding integrity is a collective 
responsibility that extends across all levels of personnel.
Guided by a stringent ‘No Gifts’ policy, TNB emphasises integrity through 
the regular signing of Integrity Pledges and the declaration of conflicts of 
interest by personnel. While certain exceptions may exist, TNB ensures 
that these policies are consistently adhered to. Prudent management of 
business associates acting on behalf of the Company further enhances 
TNB’s commitment to ethical conduct.
The reporting of misconduct by personnel or third parties is not only 
encouraged but expected, with robust protection in place for those 
acting in good faith as whistleblowers. Enforcing its position on ethical 
standards, TNB entrusts the Integrity Department with the responsibility 
of upholding and reinforcing these principles.
The TCIMS undergoes periodic assessments and updates to ensure 
its continued effectiveness in upholding the Company’s commitment 
to ethical business practices. This proactive approach reflects TNB’s 
dedication to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in its 
operations.

TNB Risk Dashboard
The BRC deliberated on quarterly TNB Risk Dashboard reports consisting 
of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) with impact to business operations, financial 
standing, regulatory, reputation and international investment. KRIs 
that had surpassed thresholds are deliberated in detail and proposed 
mitigation are challenged to effectively address related risk exposures 
and opportunities. Annually, the BSRC approves revisions to the TNB 
Risk Dashboard to ensure its relevancy and adequacy in view of changes 
in the risk landscape.
Capability Building
The BRC mandated for risk practitioners in the Group to be adequately 
trained and certified by recognised local or international professional 
bodies to ensure quality risk management practices are effectively 
implemented at all levels. Risk management training at fundamental and 
intermediate levels are conducted by TNB Integrated Learning Solution 
Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS) to increase the risk competency of employees across 
the Group.
HOW THE COMMITTEE OPERA TES
Throughout Financial Year 2023, seven (7) BRC meetings were held prior 
to 25 August 2023 and two (2) BSRC meetings were held for the remaining

meetings were communicated to the BSRC members. 
The President/CEO, Chief Operating Officer , Chief Sustainability Officer , 
Chief Risk Officer and Company Secretary, who is also secretary to 
the BRC/BSRC, attended the meetings. Other attendees, internal or 
external, were invited to deliberate on matters within their purview. 
Decisions made during these sessions were diligently documented in 
action sheets by the Company Secretary, outlining necessary steps 
for implementation. These action sheets were swiftly circulated to 
management team for further action. Furthermore, the Chairman’s 
Reports from these BRC/BSRC meetings were presented at Board 
meetings, facilitating deliberation of key sustainability and risk matters.

across the Group. The implementation of the framework is governed 
through the TNB risk governance documents, which are guidance 
documents for the business entities across the Group to implement and 
integrate risk management into its business operations for informed 
decision-making and to achieve objectives and targets.

Communication 
The BRC continues to cascade its tone from the top, and particularly in 
the year under review, through the first in-person T op Management Risk 
Forum held since the pandemic. The BRC not only set the tone on the 
importance of effective risk management but also dialogued with 102 
members of top and senior management in navigating a challenging 
risk landscape. The BRC successfully launched the TNB risk slogan,  
“RISK - First In Mind”, during the forum and the slogan has been further 
cascaded to all levels of employees through various communication 
platforms. 
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control
The BRC jointly reviewed and endorsed the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control with the BAC. Subsequently, the 
Board approved it for inclusion in the TNB Integrated Annual Report. 
This statement outlines the Group’s implemented risk management 
practices and internal controls. Additionally, it includes assurance from 
the President/CEO and Chief Financial Officer to the Board, confirming 
that the Group’s risk management and internal control system are 
operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.
(II) BSRC
From 25 August 2023 onward, the BSRC continued to exercise the 
oversight by the Board of Directors on the effective governance and 
implementation of risk and in addition placed further emphasis on 
sustainability initiatives, as follows: 
Sustainability Governance
The BSRC deliberated on TNB Sustainability Pathway and Energy 
T ransition (ET) Plan, addressing transition risks and key action items 
in our ET journey. Additionally, the BSRC also deliberated on the 
governance and structured monitoring of the TNB Sustainability Pathway 
and ET Plan that was reformed in FY2022 through the introduction of 
the Sustainability and Energy T ransition Council (SETC). This council 
aims to coordinate and oversee the TNB ET Plan, providing a platform 
for discussing the sustainability agenda, strategy development, 
implementation and value delivery of ET initiatives and climate-related 
matters. In the year under review, BSRC also approved revisions to the 
ESG related Key Risk Indicator (KRI) and its status was tabled quarterly 
through the TNB Risk Dashboard Report.
TNB Sustainability Statement 
The BSRC deliberated on the approach and plan for compliance, 
assurance, reporting of the TNB Sustainability Statement and the 
TNB Materiality Matrix, which forms part of the TNB Integrated Annual 
Report. The TNB Sustainability Statement is prepared in alignment with 
Bursa requirements and is guided by the Bursa Sustainability Reporting 
Guide (3 rd Edition).
CONCLUSION
The BSRC continues to exercise its oversight over the implementation of 
risk management initiatives for the achievement of business objectives. 
In addition, BSRC will have greater oversight over the implementation 
of the sustainability framework and the deployment of initiatives that 
are supported by specific indicators measuring performance against 
sustainability goals and targets. 
This statement was made in accordance with the resolution of the Board

The Group Internal Audit Department (GIA) 
of TNB is established by the Board to provide 
independent, objective assurance and consulting 
services designed to add value and improve TNB’s 
operations. GIA assists TNB in accomplishing its 
business objectives by bringing a systematic, 
disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the 
effectiveness of governance, risk management and 
control processes.
GIA reports directly to the BAC to preserve its 
independence and objectivity, and administratively 
to President/CEO to enable the required stature to 
fulfil its responsibilities.
GIA is headed by the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA),

and obtained a Certification of Risk Management 
Assurance from Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
APPROACHES AND FRAMEWORK
GIA strives to protect and enhance organisational 
value by providing risk-based and objective 
assurance, advice and insight through innovative 
solutions. The Internal Audit Charter , approved by 
the BAC, delineates GIA ’s responsibilities, authority, 
and scope of internal audit activities. The Charter is 
reviewed annually to ensure continued relevance to

Definition of Internal Auditing. GIA undergoes an 
external evaluation of its effectiveness and quality 
at least once every three (3) years, and the result of 
the review is subsequently reported to the BAC.
GIA is guided by the Internal Control Framework of Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the T readway Commission (COSO) and Control Objectives for Information and Related 
Technology (COBIT) in assessing and reporting the adequacy and effectiveness of the design 
and implementation of the organisation’s overall system of internal control, risk management

and non-thematic audits), ad-hoc audit, and follow-up audits. Audit findings were presented

weaknesses based on recommendations provided by GIA. GIA oversees the execution of 
corrective actions using the Audit Management System and reports the status to BAC and 
Management on a quarterly basis.

RELA TIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The Board maintains an open and professional association with External Auditors, and the BAC is entrusted with recommending their appointment or 
removal, approving their remuneration, and establishing the terms of engagement for Board approval.
Responsibilities of the Board and BAC include reviewing, assessing, and monitoring the performance, suitability, and independence of External Auditors. 
A comprehensive policy outlines guidelines and procedures for the assessment and monitoring processes, covering aspects such as Selection and 
Appointment, Independence, Conflict of Interest, Non-Audit Services, Rotation of Audit Partner , Annual Reporting, Annual Assessment and Audit Fees.
The appointed Audit Partner undergoes rotation at least every five (5) Financial Years, with a mandated two (2) year gap before returning as the Audit 
Partner for the engagement. While External Auditors may be engaged for non-audit services, their objectivity, judgment and independence must not be 
impaired. Written assurance of meeting independence requirements is obligatory for each non-audit service undertaken for the TNB Group.
Three (3) fundamental principles govern the prohibition of non-audit services: External Auditors cannot function in a management role, audit their own 
work, or serve in an advocacy role for TNB Group. Compliance with the By-Laws of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) concerning non-audit 
services is mandatory, with the application of safeguards if necessary.
TNB External Auditors Policy stipulates a three (3)-year cooling-off period for a former partner of TNB’s External Auditors before being appointed 
as a BAC member in accordance with Practice 9.2 of the MCCG. Additionally, in alignment with Guidance 9.3 of the MCCG, the annual assessment of  
External Auditors incorporates information from the Annual T ransparency Report of the audit firm.

The BAC, in evaluating the External Auditors’ independence, considers non-audit fees provided for services during the Financial Year . The conclusion is 
that these fees do not compromise or impair the independence or objectivity of the External Auditors.
The amount of Audit and Non-Audit Fees paid or payable to PwC or its affiliates by the Company and TNB Group for the Financial Year ended  
31 December 2023 is as follows:
Group
RM million
Company 
RM million
Statutory Audit 10.3 1.6
Audit Related Services 1.9 1.3
T otal 12.2 2.9
Non-Audit Services:
- T ax Related Services 0.2 0
- Other Non-Audit Services 0 0
T otal 0.2 0
The Non-Audit Fees did not exceed 50% of the Audit Fees for the Financial Year under review, in line with TNB’s External Auditors Policy. 
All services were procured competitively in accordance with TNB’s Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures and External Auditors Policy.  
Non-audit services can be offered by the External Auditors of the Group if there are clear efficiencies and value added benefits to the Group. 
Based on the External Auditors Assessment Results for the Financial Year 2023, overall, the Company was completely satisfied/satisfied, with a score of 
97%, showing an increase of 3.7% compared to the previous Financial Year , with the services provided by PwC in term of quality, sufficiency of resources, 
communication and interaction and independence, objectivity and professional skepticism. All comments made were forwarded to PwC in order to 
further improve their services. 
With that, the Board/BAC are satisfied with the quality of service, sufficiency of resources, communication and interaction and independence, objectivity 
and professional skepticism demonstrated by PwC in carrying out its duties as External Auditors. 
Being satisfied with the External Auditors’ performance, the Board recommends their re-appointment for shareholders’ approval at the AGM. 
INSIDER TRADING
Directors and T op Management at TNB must not deal in the securities of the Company or of other listed issuers as long as he/she is in possession of 
price-sensitive information relating to such listed securities. This adherence is in line with the MMLR and pertinent provisions of the Capital Markets & 
Services Act 2007. Notices delineating closed periods for trading in TNB’s securities are disseminated on a quarterly basis, well in advance of each closed 
period. The Company Secretary shall made appropriate announcement upon receiving any notices of dealing in securities in line with Paragraph 14.08 
and 14.09 of the MMLR respectively.

RESPONSIBILITY ST A TEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR UNDER REVIEW
The Board holds full responsibility for ensuring the preparation of Audited Financial Statements aligns with the Companies Act 2016 and the approved 
accounting standards set forth by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board. This commitment is aimed at presenting an accurate portrayal of 
the Group’s state of affairs, profit or loss and cash flow at the close of the accounting period. In the preparation of these financial statements, the 
Directors confirm compliance with applicable approved accounting standards in Malaysia, exercising reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates. 
Furthermore, the Audited Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board, upon thorough inquiry, reasonably expects the 
Group to possess adequate resources for its operational continuity in the foreseeable future.

ST A TEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board of Directors (the Board) is pleased 
to present its Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control (SORMIC) for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2023. This statement, 
collaboratively developed and jointly endorsed 
by the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee 
(BSRC), formerly known as the Board Risk 
Committee (BRC), and the Board Audit 
Committee (BAC), adheres to the stipulations 
set forth in paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main 
Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia 
Securities Berhad (Bursa). Additionally, it is 
guided by the Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of 
Listed Issuers issued by Bursa. 
The SORMIC delineates the nature and breadth 
of the risk management and internal control 
systems in TNB Group, including subsidiaries, 
throughout the reviewed fiscal year . It provides 
an overview of the framework, policy, process and 
measures adopted to mitigate risks and uphold 
operational integrity within TNB Group. Notably, 
this disclosure excludes associated companies 
and joint ventures.
The Board persistently upholds its overarching 
responsibility and remains dedicated to the 
establishment and continual upkeep of robust, 
efficient, and effective risk management and 
internal control systems. This commitment 
serves to safeguard shareholders’ investments 
and the assets held by the Group. These systems 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate 
risks and therefore provide reasonable rather 
than absolute assurance against material losses, 
misstatements, or other significantly adverse 
consequences.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk Management Framework
Risk management in TNB is governed by the TNB Risk Management Framework, which adopts the principles and guidelines set out in ISO 31000:2018, 
‘Risk Management - Guidelines’. This framework provides a structured and consistent approach for risk management implementation across the Group.  
The purpose of risk management is to create and protect value and this is exemplified through each element in the TNB Risk Management Framework.
The framework has been approved by the BRC/BSRC and is reviewed annually. The implementation of the TNB Risk Management Framework is documented 
through six risk governance documents, which are the TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB Risk Management Policy, TNB Risk Assessment Process,  
Risk Review, Risk Report and Key Risk Indicator (KRI). 
TNB Risk Governance Documents
The TNB Risk Management Framework document describes the criteria and frequency of revision of these risk governance documents and the levels of 
approving authority to ensure the documents are robust, practical for implementation and reflective of the internal and external context. In the year under 
review, no major change was made and revisions for clarity in these documents were deliberated and approved by the Group Risk Management Working 
Committee (GRMWC).

Risk Management Policy
The TNB Risk Management Policy is a statement of the overall intention and direction of the Group on 
risk management. It describes the commitment of the Group to assess risks in alignment to business 
objectives, integrating risk management in all decision-making processes, anticipating potential risks 
while identifying opportunities in response to changes in the internal and external environments and 
ensuring that risk information is communicated through a clear and robust monitoring and reporting 
structure.
The policy emphasises on the role of all TNB employees, who are responsible and accountable to manage 
risks by taking all reasonable care to minimise loss, maximise opportunity and ensure TNB’s reputation 
is upheld.
Leadership and Commitment
The TNB Risk Management Structure depicts the leadership and commitment of Board and  
Management in the escalation and cascading of risk information across all levels. 
Since its establishment on June 5, 2013, the 
Board Risk Committee (BRC) reaffirms the 
Board’s commitment to ensure that the Group 
has in place a robust risk management framework 
and that such framework has been effectively 
implemented to enhance the Group’s ability to 
achieve its strategic objectives. 
The BRC is supported by the Management, 
primarily through the Group Executive 
Management Committee chaired by the 
President/CEO. It is complemented by the 
cross-functional GRMWC and Subsidiaries Risk 
Management Working Committee (SRMWC). 
The Risk Management Department (RMD) 
helmed by the Chief Risk Officer facilitates the 
implementation of the TNB Risk Management 
Framework. 
Recognising the importance of sustainability 
in our business, the BRC Terms of Reference 
was reviewed, which led to the transformation 
of the BRC to the Board Sustainability and 
Risk Committee (BSRC), effective from  
25 August 2023. Consequent to changes in the 
organisational structure in the fiscal year , the 
Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to the Chief 
Sustainability Officer with RMD being one of the 
departments in the newly formed Sustainability 
Division effective from 1 June 2023. 
Throughout the fiscal year , the BRC/BSRC 
upheld its commitment to diligent oversight, 
convening nine (9) meetings to address various 
risks and opportunities associated with 
investment proposals, strategic initiatives, 
and operational dynamics. These meetings 
also encompassed a thorough review of TNB 
business entities’ operational risk profiles and  
in-depth deliberations on KRI. Moreover , the 
BRC/BSRC also endorsed the SORMIC FY2022 
and TNB Materiality Matrix FY2023, and approved 
the revised TNB Risk Dashboard FY2023, TNB 
Strategic Risks and the updated TNB Investment 
Risk Methodology. Business entities provided 
assurances to the BRC/BSRC regarding their risk 
management and internal controls, thus assisting 
the Board in its decision-making, particularly 
in managing potential risks and harnessing 
opportunities.

ST A TEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Risk Assessment Process
TNB business entities are guided by the TNB Risk Assessment Process that provides a structured approach to identify, analyse, evaluate and treat risks.  
TNB business entities apply the process in a systematic, iterative and collaborative manner , drawing on the knowledge and views of stakeholders to develop 
and review their respective risk profiles. 
The TNB Risk Assessment Process was applied in the assessment of the TNB Strategic Risks based on the Reimagining TNB (RT) strategy and in consideration 
of internal and external factors. Below are the 12TNB Strategic Risks approved by the BRC/BSRC in the year under review:
Category No. TNB Strategic Risk 
External 1. Catastrophic disruptions from external factors 
TNB faces the potential threat of unpredictable external events, which possess the capacity to significantly disrupt our 
business operations, profitability, and/or reputation. These events encompass various external factors, including but not 
limited to pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, economic collapses, and geopolitical risks. Although these occurrences have a 
low probability of transpiring, their unpredictability renders them capable of inflicting catastrophic impacts on our business 
operations.
Sustainability 2. Inability to keep pace with Environment, Social & Governance (ESG) developments and transitions globally 
Corporations worldwide face increase risks in transitioning to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It is vital that we 
align to global ESG commitments and frameworks given TNB’s role as Malaysia’s primary power utility. Failure to do so will 
impede our business growth in addition to eroding market confidence in TNB to be a utility that is able to provide sustainable 
energy solutions. This will adversely impact investors’ confidence, stakeholder’s trust and company reputation.
Regulatory 3. Unfavourable energy transition & climate change policies & regulations 
Energy T ransition regulatory risks pose significant challenges for power utilities. The shift towards renewable energy sources 
and decarbonisation initiatives may require costly infrastructure upgrades and technology investments. Evolving regulations 
can impact revenue streams and profitability, especially if incentives or subsidies change. Stricter emissions standards 
might necessitate the retirement of existing assets or impose penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, uncertainties in 
policy direction may hinder long-term planning and investments. Failure to address these risks adequately can undermine  
TNB’s competitiveness and financial stability.
4. Unfavourable Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) regulatory implementation and outcome 
Globally, the electricity supply industry is highly regulated. Government regulations and policies control various aspects, 
including approving generation capacity and mix, setting limits for investment and operation costs of electricity networks, 
and determining electricity prices. Uncertainty surrounding future regulations may hinder long-term planning and investment 
decisions whilst non-compliance with regulations can result in penalties and reputational damage. Inability to shape and 
manage the outcome of these regulation and policies governing the Malaysian ESI would be key impediment impacting TNB 
ability to deliver its business aspiration.
5. Regulatory Uncertainty 
Due to the nature of our business, we are susceptible to the decisions by regulatory stakeholders at the federal, state and 
international levels. Business operations may be delayed or encumbered due to measures and decisions in relation to 
investment and divestment, use of natural resources and right-of-way.
Market 6. Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international & domestic) 
Growing TNB’s non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB’s future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in 
difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. 
Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access 
capital while reducing the overall returns.
Customer 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers 
TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the 
trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB’s brand and reputation. Failure to do so 
may cause customer dissatisfaction and impact our sales, EBIT and reputation.

Review, Monitor and Report
The BRC/BSRC approved the TNB 3-Year Cycle Risk Governance Plan for 
implementation from FY2022 to FY2024. This plan is implemented by the 
RMD to assist the BRC/BSRC in meeting its terms of reference. The plan 
outlines three (3) risk governance activities, which are risk review, risk 
maturity assessment and desktop risk assessment. According to plan, RMD  
in collaboration with TNB business entities, conducted 15 risk reviews, five 
(5) risk maturity assessments and eight (8) desktop risk assessments in the 
year under review. 
As per the TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB business entities are 
responsible to assess respective risks and register into the TNB Risk 
Information System (TRIS), a centralised online real-time tool and database, 
for monitoring and reporting. Risks are also reviewed annually by the business 
entities with participation and eventual approval from the risk owners. 
Half-year risk reports are submitted by business entities to RMD for 
consolidation. Group-wide consolidated half-year risk reports, which include 
reports of emerging risks, are deliberated and endorsed by the GRMWC for 
onward internal dissemination. 
Key Risk Indicators
Business entities have diligently identified relevant Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) 
that serve as early warning of increasing risk exposures and potential risk 
events. These KRIs are developed in consideration of the risk appetite of 
the BRC/BSRC and Management. The status of KRIs is reported quarterly to 
the BRC/BSRC, GRMWC and SRMWC with mitigating measures extensively 
deliberated to address risk exposures from escalating beyond tolerable 
levels. 
The BRC/BSRC monitors KRIs impacting five (5) key areas, which are 
operations, financial standing, regulatory, reputation and international 
investment. Operational-level KRIs are deliberated by the GRMWC and 
SRMWC that are platforms for inter-business collaboration to mitigate risks 
from a group-wide perspective. 
Annually, these KRIs undergo review to ensure relevance and adequacy, 
aligning with short- and long-term business objectives while considering 
changes in internal and external environments. 
Communication & Integration
TNB business entities consistently engage in communication with both 
internal and external stakeholders, providing current and comprehensive risk 
information. Timely feedback is gathered and integrated to foster continual 
enhancement. Integral to their role is the seamless integration of risk 
management within their objectives, governance, leadership commitment, 
operations, and performance management. This holistic approach ensures 
that risk management becomes an inherent part of the operational fabric, 
enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the Group.
ST A TEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
Category No. TNB Strategic Risk 
Finance 8. Ineffective capital allocation to maximise value creation 
Management makes decisions on how to source and allocate funds effectively to maximise potential return. Failure to do so 
would have dire implications to TNB, including missed opportunities, reduced financial profits and market confidence.
Capabilities 9. Gaps in workforce capabilities to deliver RT strategy and sustainability aspiration 
It is critical for TNB to focus on developing and deploying new institutional capabilities to the right areas. We also need to 
enhance workforce diversity in terms of skill sets and exposures that are in line with our aspiration to diversify internationally. 
Failure to close the capabilities gap would impact TNB’s ability to achieve its RT strategy.
10. Failure to ingrain TNB culture in employees’ behaviour in supporting Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability aspiration 
Culture molds the direction, beliefs and shared values that shapes employee (at all levels including the Board)’s perceptions, 
behaviours and understanding. Failure to ingrain the Reimagining Culture values in the organisation and processes may result 
in lower productivity, fraud and bribery or silo mentality.
Physical 
Asset Risk
11. Failure to mitigate physical risks caused by climate change 
Physical climate change risks pose significant challenges to TNB in the form of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and 
changing precipitation patterns that can damage infrastructure, disrupt operations and impact power generation, transmission 
and distribution. Failure to manage these risks can result in prolonged outages, increased operation and repair costs, regulatory 
penalties, reputational damage and impede long-term business sustainability.
Supply Chain 12. Disruptions to supply chain 
TNB’s ability to ensure the security of supply depends on undisrupted procurement and distribution of resources needed 
to operate all its infrastructure. Delays or disruption resulting from supplier failure, transportation issues and geopolitical 
interventions may lead to delays in project delivery, prolonged electricity supply outages and increased costs.

The BRC/BSRC continues to cascade its tone from the top, and particularly in the fiscal year , through the first in-person T op Management Risk Forum held since 
the pandemic. The BRC/BSRC not only set the tone on the importance of effective risk management but also dialogued with 102 members of top and senior 
management in navigating a challenging risk landscape. Market experts such as the Head of Carbon Market, Bursa Malaysia, were invited to share insights on 
risk and opportunities related to the power utility industry. The TNB risk slogan, “RISK - First In Mind”, was launched by the BRC/BSRC during the forum and 
was further cascaded to all levels of employees through various communication platforms. 
RMD actively promotes a culture of risk awareness throughout TNB in the year under review, organising five (5) highly successful face to face internal risk 
conferences, bringing together 383 TNB executives and non-executives. These risk communication efforts were held to encourage active participation 
across all levels with emphasis on the importance and benefits of integrating risk management into daily operations and decision-making processes. The 
strong support, including the commitment from TNB Management in holding dialogues with the employees during these conferences, reflects the shared 
responsibility for effective risk management by all employees in order to successfully navigate current and future challenges.
Additionally, RMD in collaboration with TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS), the centre for energy learning, advisory, services and consultancy, 
continue to drive risk management training modules at fundamental and intermediate levels. In the year under review, a total of 116 TNB employees completed  
the fundamentals module and 119 employees completed the intermediate module. 
During the fiscal year , the first TNB Risk Management E-Learning Module was launched and incorporated as part of the learning journey of all TNB executives, 
whereby each TNB executive shall complete the online module every two (2) years. The purpose of the e-learning module is to inculcate a risk thinking  
mindset and strengthen informed decision-making among TNB executives. The e-learning module is continually reviewed taking into account changes in the 
TNB Risk Management Framework and its implementation. 
Culture
The risk culture delineated within the TNB Risk Management Framework harmonises seamlessly with the six (6) TNB core values and corresponding behaviors. 
The application of these core values and behaviours serves as a beacon, offering clear guidance and communicates the expected behaviour of employees.  
This alignment fortifies a cohesive understanding, establishing a framework for fostering and perpetuating a resilient and enduring risk culture essential for 
TNB’s sustainable growth and resilience.

Financial and Operational Control Framework
The TNB Group Financial Policies and Procedures (GFPP) stand as an 
imperative point of reference guiding the Group’s financial and operational 
conduct. The Group has acted in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards. 
Regular evaluations comparing actual performance against established 
budgets, targets, and historical benchmarks for key functions and strategic 
initiatives are carried out. Necessary mitigating measures and follow-up 
actions are promptly implemented.
The Board Audit Committee (BAC) reviews the Group’s quarterly financial 
performance together with Management and these are subsequently 
reported to the Board. The quarterly reviews enable the BAC to deliberate 
and assess the Group’s financial results and operational performance. 
TNB continues to proactively engage with relevant stakeholders for smooth 
implementation of the Incentive-Based Regulations (IBR) framework.  
The performance of the regulated business is meticulously monitored 
through the IBR performance indicators and dashboards. These are reported 
regularly to relevant decision-making committees to ensure effective 
implementation of the IBR framework as well as to the Energy Commission  
in compliance with the IBR guidelines. 
The procedures for critical functions and key activities are documented, 
communicated to employees and periodically reviewed. Relevant business 
entities have been consistently maintaining its certification in ISO 9001,  
ISO 14001, ISO 27001, ISO 37001, ISO 45001 and ISO 55001. Internal 
audits are conducted to ensure compliance with relevant standards and  
procedures. 
Strategic Planning and Performance Management Cycle
A holistic strategic planning process is integral in providing focus and 
alignment between aspiration, strategies, performance management and 
the desired strategic outcomes. The Strategic Planning and Performance 
Management (SPPM) cycle approved by the Board depicts a 5-part cycle that 
integrates the capital and budget allocation process with the performance 
management cycle. It includes the identification of strategy driven Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI) based on long-term business plans and annual 
operating plans, which are thereafter cascaded to all levels of employees. 
The strategy driven KPI methodology is derived from the Balanced  
Scorecard concept that focuses on performance measures from four (4) 
perspectives, which are financial, customer , internal process and learning 
and growth. 
Human Resource Management and Development
The TNB Ways of Working (T woW) that promotes flexible working 
arrangements has been implemented across the Group in the year under 
review. This strategic decision seamlessly aligns with the amendments 
to the Employment (Amendment) Act 2022, particularly in embracing and 
enacting flexible working arrangements. This way of working aims to inspire 
and add value to employees, create an agile workforce and foster a culture  
of wholehearted dedication, underpinned by three (3) fundamental principles 
of trust, empowerment, and mindfulness.
Job descriptions and responsibilities of approved positions are clearly 
defined and communicated through the internal online platform, People 
Matters Better Brighter . Workforce requirement planning is carried out and 
led by the Group Human Resource, mirroring the budget planning cycle with 
the aim of optimising staffing levels and increasing productivity. Employee 
training needs are regularly assessed and various programmes are in place  
to address competency gaps.
Moreover , effective succession management improves organisational 
ability to maintain continuity of operations with minimal disruption and 
benefits both the employees by preparing them to be strong talents and 
the organisation by facilitating smooth transitions. The TNB Succession 
Management Framework aims to ensure the succession management 
strategy is agile and in line with current and projected business objectives 
by defining critical positions, nominating and evaluating talents, identifying 
development needs, and reviewing and adapting to business needs. 
Healthcare & Wellness Management
TNB is committed towards elevating the standard of healthcare for its 
employees, retirees, and dependents. A key initiative introduced in the year 
under review is the Medication Delivery Services (MDS) to facilitate seamless 
procurement and delivery of long-term or chronic medications through 
three (3) Klinik TNB. In addition, 1,276 panel hospitals and clinics are available 
nationwide for widespread accessibility to essential medical treatment and 
healthcare.
The TNB T otal Wellness Programme is aimed at educating and influencing 
employees towards a healthy lifestyle and work life balance continues 
to be implemented through the “Vibrant Living - Healthier . T ogether” 
initiative. This initiative focuses on six (6) scope, which are healthy diet,  
no smoking/vaping, active lifestyle, weight management, basic health 
screening and mental well-being. Weekly “Wellness Wednesday” health talks 
and awareness sessions conducted online are open to all employees and 
retirees with the aim of increasing awareness on common health issues and 
encouraging healthier habits.
TNB Digital Strategy
TNB has undertaken significant digitalisation endeavours to embrace 
digital transformation as a key enabler of the RT strategy. These initiatives 
encompass data analytics, robotic process automation, and development of 
a visionary Network of the Future. TNB remains steadfast in advancing digital 
transformation aligned to national and organisational aspiration.

Personal Data Protection 
TNB is committed to safeguard data subjects’ personal data in accordance 
with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA). TNB was an active 
contributor to the development of The Personal Data Protection Code of 
Practice for The Utilities Sector (Electricity) Version 2.0 (Code of Practice), 
which serves as a guideline for the processing and handling of data subjects’ 
personal data. As data privacy is vital, the Legal Services Department is 
committed to consistently educate and communicate the requirements of 
the PDPA and the Code of Practice across TNB to enhance awareness and 
compliance to the PDPA.
TNB Corporate Integrity Management System 
The TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) is in place to 
improve the integrity culture in the Group, reduce the impact of corruption 
or mismanagement and position TNB at par internationally through a 
strategic and structured integrity management system. TNB is certified with 
ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems since 2018 and has put 
in place a management system designed to help prevent, detect and respond 
to bribery and comply with anti-bribery laws and voluntary commitments 
applicable to its activities. Annually, TNB employees complete the Integrity 
Pledge and Conflict of Interest declarations via the Employee Self Service 
system and the Integrity E-learning module via the People Matters Better 
Brighter system. The integrity e-learning module is also extended to the 
vendors and suppliers.
The Integrity Department designs and implements a comprehensive training 
and communication plan comprising of initiatives and programs to address 
gaps identified in the annual Integrity Health Index (IHI) survey. Highlights 
of the training and communication initiatives implemented in the fiscal year 
include a seminar for the Board and Management titled “The Law Behind 
Corporate Governance” conducted by the Malaysia Institute of Corporate 
Governance (MICG) and engagements and training sessions with the unions, 
employees and vendors on anti-bribery, corruption and corporate liability. 
These efforts align with the requirements outlined in the TRUST elements 
under Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009. 
Additionally, the Whistle Blowing Information System (WBIS) underwent 
enhancements in the year under review to strengthen the management of 
integrity governance data for reporting to the Board Integrity Committee 
and in compliance to mandatory reporting requirements by MACC.
T enaga Safety Culture 
The Tenaga Safety Culture Programme aims to inculcate safety as part of the 
everyday working culture, transforming it from a mere compliance activity. 
It is based on four core behaviours, which are ‘ Assess’, ‘Comply’, ‘Intervene’ 
and ‘ Actively Caring’. Various initiatives have been implemented such as 
the TNB Life Saving Rules (LSR) that has been in effect since 2017. These 
rules are intended to preserve the lives of employees and contractors, and 
mitigate the risk of serious injuries within the work environment. The LSR 
implementation includes consequence management as part of our internal 
controls.

Management Information Systems
Leveraging on information and communication technology is vital in promoting effective and efficient business operations as well as timely and accurate 
communication with internal and external stakeholders. Examples of key information systems utilised by the Group for that purpose are:
Super User Privilege Management and Governance, Risk and Compliance systems have been implemented to control and govern access to core systems 
and servers. This is to ensure that access to critical information systems and confidential information is adequately monitored and controlled. Annual 
disaster recovery tests are carried out at the data centres and ICT security assessments are regularly carried out on systems at the business entities. In 
addition, various enhancements are implemented to strengthen cyber security for Information Technology and Operational Technology systems. In the

The Stop Work Intervention guideline was established in the year under 
review to empower employees and contractors to assume responsibility 
for their safety and the safety of their peers. Any individual is authorised to 
activate a stop work intervention upon encountering unsafe conditions or 
observing unsafe acts within the workplace. In addition, the NIOSH Tenaga 
Safety Leader Passport (NTSLP) certification, which is implemented across 
the Group for all employees, has been extended and enforced in the fiscal 
year for contractor supervisors. This aims to address the primary cause 
of past contractor accidents due to inadequate supervision. NIOSH had 
acknowledged the strategic partnership of this program, further validating 
its importance and impact. 
Customer Experience
With attention to customer centricity, a variety of channels, utilising the  
“Click, Call, Come Over ,” platform, is made available to customers. The 
platform covers a wide range of touch points that enable quality solutions, 
services and continuous interaction options to enhance customer  
experience. A systematic approach is in place for timely resolution of 
feedback such as service requests, complaints, comments, enquiries and 
concerns. In addition, the myTNB web portal and mobile application are 
available to customers to manage their electricity account(s) in one location. 
myTNB allows customers to make express payment of electricity bills 
without needing to log in.
Business Continuity Management
The TNB Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework was developed 
in alignment with ISO 22301:2019 ‘Security and Resilience - Business 
Continuity Management Systems’. The framework provides a structured 
approach in managing business continuity in the Group that enables prompt, 
coordinated and effective response to a crisis and maintain continuity of 
essential activities as well as protecting human life, assets, reputation and 
the environment. The framework is the focal point of reference for TNB 
business entities to formulate and implement business continuity strategies 
tailored to respective business objectives and critical functions. 
The robustness of the TNB Corporate Crisis Command Structure, of which 
the President/CEO and TNB Management are members, is tested annually 
through planned drills and is activated to manage potential or declared 
crises in accordance with the Corporate TNB BCM document. Improvements 
identified in post-mortems are implemented to enhance capabilities, 
preparedness and resiliency. Additionally, drills of various scenarios are 
collaboratively conducted by TNB business entities to enhance coordination 
and effective response. In the year under review, specific business continuity 
plans were developed and tested to ensure available and reliable electricity 
supply throughout the period of the Malaysian state elections at Selangor , 
Kelantan, Terengganu, Negeri Sembilan, Kedah, and Penang following the 
dissolution of respective state assemblies.
T o further strengthen prompt and coordinated response during crises that 
affect the nation, strategic engagements were carried out with relevant 
government agencies such as the National Disaster Management Agency 
(NADMA) via courtesy visits and joint drills. Notable outcomes in the fiscal 
year are the successful desktop drills conducted in collaboration with NADMA 
based on a dam safety scenario and with the Majlis Keselamatan Negara 
(MKN) based on a security threat scenario to critical national infrastructures 
in power utility, telecommunications, and oil and gas. 
CONCLUSION
The Board has obtained assurances from the President/CEO and Chief 
Financial Officer that the Group’s risk management and internal control 
system is operating adequately and effectively, in all material aspects.  
Where areas of improvement have been identified, rectification steps have 
been taken for enhancement. 
The Board is of the view that the risk management and internal control 
system in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of  
this statement for inclusion into the annual report, is adequate and effective 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment, the interests of customers, 
regulators and employees, and the Group’s assets.

ST A TUTORY INFORMA TION ON THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
(a) Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of provision for doubtful debts and

(ii) to ensure that any current assets, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business, including the values of current assets 
as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which the current assets might be 
expected so to realise.
(b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts inadequate to any substantial 
extent; or
(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or
(iii) which have arisen and would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company 
misleading or inappropriate.
(c) At the date of this report:
(i) there are no charges on the assets of the Group and of the Company which have arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the 
liabilities of any other person; and

(d) No contingent or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve 
months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to 
meet their obligations when they fall due.
(e) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS
31 December 2023
1 GENERAL INFORMA TION
 The Group and the Company are primarily involved in the business of the generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity and those 
tabulated in Note 49 to these financial statements, which also includes the details of the subsidiaries of the Group.
 There have been no significant changes in these activities of the Group and of the Company during the financial year .
 The Group and the Company follow the Incentive Based Regulation (‘IBR’) framework for the regulated business.
 The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad.
 The address of the registered office of the Company is Pejabat Setiausaha Syarikat, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (‘TNB’), Tingkat 16, T ower A, TNB 
Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, Bangsar , 59100 Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia. 
 The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been approved for issuance in accordance with a resolution of Board of Directors on 
19 March 2024.
2 BASIS OF PREPARA TION 
 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘MFRS’), International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. 
The Directors continue to consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
 The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in Note 3 and respective notes in the 
financial statements.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgement in the 
process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgements are based on the Directors’ 
best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ . The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas 
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
(a) New standard and amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company.
Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2023:
MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts
Amendments to MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts Initial Application of MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and MFRS 9

2 BASIS OF PREPARA TION (CONTINUED)
(a) New standard and amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company. (continued)
 Adoption and amendments to MFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts
 The adoption of MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and its related amendments has resulted in changes in accounting policies, shifting from 
recognising insurance profits upon premium receipt to acknowledging them as it fulfils insurance services. In addition, it requires disclosing 
anticipated future profits from insurance contract. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 
and it supersedes MFRS 4. 
 The Group and the Company completed the assessment of MFRS 17 and concluded that the impact from adoption of the standard is mainly 
contributed by TNB Global Captive (L) Ltd., which provides reinsurance services. The adoption of MFRS 17 does not have a material impact on 
the consolidated financial statements and hence the prior period financial statements were not restated. Adjustments related to the changes 
in accounting policies and other relevant disclosures under MFRS 17 are detailed in Notes 17, 21, 23 and 31 of the financial statements.
 Amendments to MFRS 112 - Income T axes
 Amendments to MFRS 112 Income T axes on International T ax Reform - Pillar T wo Model Rules give entities temporary relief from recognising 
and disclosing accounting for deferred taxes arising from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (‘OECD’) 
international tax reform and introduces targeted disclosure requirements to help investors better understand an entity’s exposure to income 
taxes arising from the reform, particularly before legislation implementing the rules is in effect. The Group applied temporary exception for 
the year ended 31 December 2023.
 The legislation will be effective for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024 in certain jurisdictions. The Group is in the process of 
assessing the potential exposure arising from Pillar T wo legislation and expects to complete the assessment in the financial year ending 2024.
(b) Amendments to the published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective.

3 SUMMARY OF MA TERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and within the respective 
notes to the financial statements line items.
(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
 Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when:
• exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity;
• has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity; and
• the existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered only when such rights are substantive when assessing control.
 In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On 
disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts are included in the statement 
of profit or loss.
(ii) Basis of consolidation
 The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The characteristics of 
those financial statements are:
• the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.
• subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date 
that such control ceases. 
• intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains or losses are eliminated in full. 
• uniform accounting policies are adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar 
circumstances.
 The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for acquisition 
of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The 
consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and 
fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets 
acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their 
fair value at the acquisition date.

TENAGA NASIONAL BERHAD  Integrated Annual Report 2023
216
3 SUMMARY OF MA TERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation (continued)
(ii) Basis of consolidation (continued)
 The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous 
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss. Refer to Note 10 for accounting policy on goodwill.
 NCI is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group 
measures any NCI in the acquiree either at fair value or at the NCI’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. At the 
end of the reporting period, NCI consists of amount calculated on the date of combinations and its share of changes in the subsidiary’s 
equity since the date of combination.
 All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the NCI, even if the attribution of losses to the NCI results in a 
debit balance in the shareholders’ equity.
(iii) Changes in ownership interest
 When the Group ceases to consolidate because of loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with 
the change in carrying amount recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the 
purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts 
previously recognised in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or 
liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to statement of profit or loss. Gains or losses on 
the disposal of subsidiaries include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiaries sold.
(b) T ransactions with NCI
 T ransactions with NCI that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in 
ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and NCI to reflect their relative interests in the 
subsidiary. Any differences between the amount of the adjustment to NCI and any consideration paid or received are recognised in equity 
attributable to owners of the Group.
(c) Impairment of non-financial assets
 Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss for the amount by which the carrying 
amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and its value in use 
(‘VIU’). For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows 
which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).
 Non-financial assets other than goodwill previously impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.  
Any subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
 All other material accounting policies are disclosed in their respective notes.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND JUDGEMENTS
 Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely 
equate to the related actual results. T o enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a 
material impact on the Group’s and the Company’s results and financial positions are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters.
 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below:
(a) Impairment of associates
 The Group and the Company assess impairment of its investment in associates whenever the events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e. the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured 
at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and its VIU. The VIU is the net present value of the projected future cash flow derived from the 
investment discounted at an appropriate discount rate. Projected future cash flows are based on the Group’s estimates calculated based 
on historical, sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, changes in technology and other available information.  
The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessments are disclosed in Note 9.
(b) Impairment of intangible assets
 The Group tests intangible assets which includes goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with its accounting policy and whenever 
events or change in circumstances indicate that this is necessary within the financial period. This requires an estimation of the VIU of the cash 
generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future 
cash flows from the CGU to the Group and also to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessment of goodwill are disclosed in Note 10.
(c) Measurement of expected credit loss (‘ECL ’) allowance for financial assets
 The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group and the Company 
use judgements in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group’s and the Company’s 
past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of key assumptions 
and inputs used are disclosed in Note 45.
(d) Recognition of fair value adjustments and intangible assets arising from acquisitions
 During the financial year , the Group acquired Spark Renewables Pty Ltd Group (‘Spark Renewables’), Dullarbtons Limited (‘Dullarbtons’) and 
Elipsgeen Limited (‘Elipsgeen’), and purchase price allocation exercises were undertaken which involved assumptions in determining the 
fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The provisional goodwill arising from these acquisitions amounted to 
RM491.1 million. Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 48.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)
(e) Estimation of income taxes
(i) Income tax
 Income tax is estimated based on the rules governed under the Income T ax Act, 1967.
 Differences in determining the capital allowances, deductibility of certain expenses and subsequent utilisation of reinvestment 
allowance may arise during the estimation of the provision for income tax between tax calculated at the statement of financial position 
date, and the final submission to the tax authority as a result of obtaining further detailed information that may become available 
subsequent to the statement of financial position date.
 Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact 
the income tax provisions and deferred tax balance in the period in which such determination is made.
 The Group and the Company have recorded tax recoverable for which the Group and the Company believe that it is probable to be 
recovered. Where the final tax outcome of this matter is different from the amount that was initially recorded, such difference may 
cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the tax recoverable balance recorded in the period in which such determination 
is made.
 Reinvestment allowance (‘RIA ’) litigation
 The Company and the Inland Revenue Board (‘IRB’) have entered into varies of litigation cases in respect of the Company’s eligibility for 
RIA. The details of the cases are as disclosed in Note 42(a).
 As at 31 December 2023, the Group and the Company recorded a tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million from the IRB arising from:
• Resubmission of tax computations for the Years of Assessment (‘YAs’) 2003 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012 pursuant to the explicit 
approval given by the IRB on 21 January 2013 on the eligibility of the Company in claiming the RIA amounted to RM1,765.2 million; 
and
• The payment which had been made to IRB in December 2020 in respect of YAs 2016 and 2017 amounted to RM1,757.2 million 
which is disputed by IRB as detailed in Note 42(a).
 The Group and the Company have not recorded the potential additional tax liability arising from the tax impact if the RIA claimed is 
disallowed and the Company loses its litigation. The realisation of this tax recoverable and the potential tax liability are dependent on 
the outcome of judgement on the RIA claims by the Special Commissioners of Income T ax (‘SCIT’) and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, 
including the subsequent notice of appeal filed by IRB before the Court of Appeal.
 The Directors have performed an assessment on the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and the potential tax liability of RM6,101.4 
million based on legal view obtained from external legal counsel and the facts surrounding its RIA claims. The Directors have exercised 
judgement that there is sufficient evidence and case law to support the Company’s appeal against the Notices and no provisions to be 
recognised with regards to the potential tax liability.
(ii) Deferred tax assets
 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the 
particular entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, as disclosed in Note 12.

4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMA TES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)
 The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)
(f) Post-employment employee benefits
 The Group and the Company provide both Retirement Benefit Plan and Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees. The present value 
of the employee benefits obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions. 
The key assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income) for the employee benefits include discount rate, medical claim inflation rate 
and salary increment rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of employee benefits obligations, as disclosed 
in Note 24.
• Discount rate
 The Group and the Company determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each financial period. This is the interest rate 
that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension 
obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group and the Company consider the interest rates of high-quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating 
the terms of the related employee benefits obligations.
• Medical claim inflation rate
 The medical claim inflation rate for general practitioner , hospitalisation, specialist and dialysis medical claims, as determined by the 
Group and the Company are based on the annualised increase in average claims over the past 5 years.
• Salary increment rate
 The salary increment rate for employees receiving the Retirement Benefit Plan as determined by the Group and the Company is based 
on the average salary increment rate for the past 13 years and considerations for price inflation, real salary increase, promotions and 
Collective Agreement (‘CA ’) negotiation.
5 PROPERTY , PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (‘PPE’)
Accounting Policy
PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the construction or acquisition of the items and bringing them to the location and condition so as to render them operational in 
the manner intended by the Group and the Company and allocated according to its components.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the items can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
The cost of major overhaul/inspection is recognised in the asset’s carrying amount as a replacement and the remaining carrying amount of the 
previous major overhaul/inspection is derecognised.
Major spare parts and standby equipment are recognised as assets when the Group and the Company expect to use for more than one period. 
Similarly, if the spare parts and servicing equipment can be used only in connection with an item of PPE, they are accounted for as PPE.
Gains or losses on disposal of PPE are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis.
At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications 
exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

6 RIGHT -OF-USE ('ROU') ASSETS
Accounting Policy
A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for consideration.
T o assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:
• The contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or 
represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier (‘lessor’) has a substantive substitution right, then 
the asset is not identified;
• The customer (‘lessee’) has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of 
use; and
• The customer (‘lessee’) has the right to direct the use of the asset. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the 
asset is used is predetermined, the customer (‘lessee’) has the right to direct the use of the asset if either the customer (‘lessee’) has the 
right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.
The Group and the Company as lessees
The Group and the Company lease various buildings, plant and machinery, furniture and fittings, office equipment and motor vehicles. These 
leases have tenures between 1 and 25 years. Lease terms are generally negotiated on an individual basis. As for leasehold land, the remaining 
period of the respective leases ranges from 4 to 99 years.
(i) Initial recognition
 The Group and the Company recognise a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases conveying the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time.
 The ROU assets recognised by the Group and the Company are initially recorded at cost, which comprise the following:
• The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;
• Any lease payments made on or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;
• Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and the Company; and
• An estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group and the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the 
site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lessor .
 The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are 
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.
 Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:
• Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
• Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;
• Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
• The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

Accounting Policy (continued)
The Group and the Company as lessees (continued)
(ii) Subsequent measurement
 After initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure ROU assets at cost:
• Less any accumulated depreciation;
• Less any accumulated impairment losses; and
• Adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
 The Group and the Company measure the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, 
reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessments or 
lease modifications. The interest on the lease liability is recognised as finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Extension and termination options
 Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. In determining the 
lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not 
exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is 
reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).
 The assessment of reasonable certainty is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects 
this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.
The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets. 
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company apply MFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the 
contract based on the stand-alone selling prices.
A ROU asset and its corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date the leased asset is available for used by the Group and the Company. 
Each lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to statement of profit or loss over the 
lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The ROU asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.
At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exist, an 
analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

 The list of the Group subsidiaries is disclosed in Note 49. Capital and other commitments for the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 41. Contingent 
liabilities for the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 42.
(a) Movement in accumulated impairment losses for investment in subsidiaries was mainly contributed by the impairment assessment for Power 
and Energy International (Mauritius) Ltd. (‘PEIM’):
 During the financial year , the Company had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in PEIM, an investment holding company. 
Based on the impairment assessment which estimates the cash flow available for distribution from PEIM’s divestment of its significant 
associate, GMR Energy Limited (‘GEL ’) as disclosed in Note 9, the recoverable amount of the Company’s investment in PEIM exceeded its 
carrying amount, hence a reversal of impairment loss of RM137.7 million (2022: NIL) was recognised in the current financial year .
(b) Non-controlling interests (‘NCI’)

8 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS
Accounting Policy
A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or more parties 
where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 
The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to 
the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint venturers have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint 
operations are joint arrangements whereby the Company has the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. In respect of its interests 
in joint operations, the Company shall recognise in its financial statements the assets that it controls and the expenses and liabilities that it 
incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the sale of goods or services.
The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

Accounting Policy (continued)
Equity accounting involves recognising in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of OCI and consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the Group’s share of profits less losses of the joint ventures based on the latest audited financial statements 
or management accounts of the joint ventures, made up to the financial year end of the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
results and net assets of the joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. The Group’s investments in 
joint ventures are recorded at cost inclusive of goodwill and adjusted thereafter for accumulated impairment losses and the post-acquisition 
change in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in joint ventures. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated on the same basis but only to the extent of the costs that can be recovered, and the balances that provide 
evidence of reduction in net realisable value or an impairment of the asset transferred are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit 
or loss.

(a) Divestment in GEL
 2023
 During the financial year , the Group via its wholly owned subsidiary, PEIM, had completed the divestment of its entire 30.0% equity interest 
in GEL via a Settlement Agreement for an amount of RM133.0 million (USD28.5 million) in cash. Hence, GEL has ceased to be an associate of 
the Group. 
Accounting Policy
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding 
of between 20.0% and 50.0% of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting and are initially 
recognised at cost. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group ceases to have significant influence over the associates.
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of  
post-acquisition movements in OCI are recognised in OCI. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests in the associate, including any 
long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports 
profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised. 
The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses (Note 3(c)).
Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised in the Group’s 
financial statements only for the unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. The accounting policies of associates are adjusted where 
necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Dilution of gains and losses in associates are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously 
recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit or loss where appropriate.

 2023
 Due to adverse external market conditions, the Group had undertaken an impairment assessment of its investment in BODL in the 
current year . An impairment charge of RM31.2 million (GBP5.5 million) was recognised as its recoverable amount was lower than the 
carrying amount.
 The recoverable amount of BODL was determined based on VIU calculations which applied a discounted free cash flow to equity model. 
The cash flows used are the most recent projections and sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of relevant variables.

(b) (ii) Impairment assessment for Lumut Maritime Terminal Sdn. Bhd. (‘LMT’)
 2023
 The Group had reviewed the basis of impairment parameter updated based on 2023 data. Based on the assessment, the recoverable 
amount exceeded its carrying amount, hence no additional impairment loss was recognised in the current financial year .
 2022
 The Group had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in LMT , an associate. The assessment was triggered by 
Net Zero 2050 initiative of no extension of Power Purchase Agreement (‘PPA ’) provided for the coal fired power plant. Based on the 
impairment assessment, the carrying amount of the Group’s investment in LMT exceeded its recoverable amount by RM68.6 million.
 Key assumption used
 The recoverable amount was determined based on VIU calculations, which applied a discounted cash flow model of LMT for the 
remaining operation and maintenance contract period which expires in 2042 and its other sources of income. The cash flows used in 
the calculations are the most recent forecasts and projections approved by the Board of Directors and management of LMT .
 The key assumptions used in determining the VIU were:
2022
%
Terminal growth rate 2.0
Cost of equity 9.0
 The cash flows were discounted using cost of equity based on the risk specific to the industry. The key assumptions includes optimisation 
of LMT’s assets and no new source of business.

Accounting Policy
Goodwill
Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregate of fair value of consideration transferred, the amount 
of any NCI in the acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. If the fair value of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets of the acquire in the case of a bargain purchase, the resulting gain is recognised in statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill is recognised in the statement of financial position as non-current asset at cost less accumulated impairment losses and tested 
for impairment annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the 
CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill 
is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying 
value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of VIU and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately to the statement of profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity 
include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity disposed.
Rights to build 
The rights to build are stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The rights to build are considered to have a 
finite life. The asset is reviewed annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are 
recognised when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell 
and its VIU.
Subsequent costs involved in renewing or maintaining the rights to build are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

Project development portfolio
The project development portfolio consists of contractual rights acquired relating to early stage solar , wind and Battery Energy Storage System 
(‘BESS’) projects in Australia.
The project development portfolio is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are considered to have a 
finite life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future economic benefits of the asset. The asset is reviewed 
annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying 
value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its VIU.

 Impairment assessment for goodwill
 The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU including goodwill, is determined based on 
its VIU. This VIU calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on forecast approved by management. The 
forecasts reflect management’s expectations of revenue growth, operating costs and margins for the CGUs based on current assessment of 
market share, expectations of market and industry growth. 
 The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecast refers to the industry’s pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (‘WACC’).
(a) Goodwill relating to operations in Malaysia
 The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a five-year period and cash flows beyond the projection years are 
extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate.
 The following key assumptions have been applied in the VIU calculation:

 Based on the Group’s assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2023 as the recoverable amount exceeded the 
carrying amount.
 The Group’s review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, it was 
concluded that no reasonable change in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable 
amount.
(b) Goodwill relating to operations in the United Kingdom 
 The Group tests whether the goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The Group has determined the recoverable amount 
of foreign CGU by assessing the VIU of the underlying assets. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying value of the goodwill as at 
31 December 2023 exceeded its recoverable amount by RM123.6 million (2022: RM22.7 million), mainly due to external market conditions 
affecting future cash flows.

Accounting Policy
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the 
financial statements including those arising from business combinations. Deferred tax is not recognised on goodwill and those arising from 
initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences, unused tax losses and unutilised tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on 
investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled 
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
T ax benefit from reinvestment allowance is recognised when the tax credit is utilised and no deferred tax asset is recognised when the tax 
credit is receivable.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
The Group and the Company will recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for any temporary differences arising on initial 
recognition of a lease transaction. Where applicable, a deferred tax asset is recognised as the Group and the Company is able to benefit from 
the tax deductions in the future. Any differences between the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability will be recognised in the profit and 
loss. Upon adopting the amendments, the Group and the Company do not expect material adjustments to the retained earnings as the initial 
recognition of the lease transactions gave rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred taxes relate to the same tax authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the 
statement of financial position:

Accounting Policy
The Group and the Company as lessors
When the Group and the Company act as lessors, they determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. 
T o classify each lease, the Group and the Company make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise, then it is an operating 
lease.
Operating leases
Leases where the Group and the Company retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as 
operating leases. The Group and the Company recognise lease payments received under operating leases as operating income on a straight-
line basis over the lease term.
Finance leases
If the Group and the Company transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets, leases are classified 
as finance leases. The Group and the Company derecognise the leased assets and recognise the net investment in the lease as a receivable. 
The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income 
is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.
The Group and the Company as lessees
The accounting policy on ROU assets and lease liabilities for lessees are disclosed in Note 6.

17 CONTRACT BALANCES
Accounting Policy
(a) Contract cost assets - Costs to fulfil a contract
 The Group recognises a contract cost that relates directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract as an asset when the cost generates 
or enhances resources of the Group which will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and it is expected to be 
recovered.
 These contract costs are initially measured at cost and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of revenue 
recognition to which the asset relates. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the carrying amount of 
the contract cost exceeds the expected revenue less expected cost that will be incurred. Where the impairment condition no longer 
exists or has improved, the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost does not exceed the 
amount that would have been recognised had there been no impairment loss recognised previously.
 
(b) T rade contract assets
 A trade contract asset is recognised when the Group’s and the Company’s rights to consideration are conditional on something other than 
the passage of time. A contract asset is subject to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ (Note 45). T ypically, the 
amount will be billed within 30 days of the supply of electricity for electricity customers and 60 to 180 days for satisfying the performance 
obligation for other revenue streams. An assessment of electricity supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading 
and the financial year end of the Group and of the Company (unread and unbilled) was made and it is recognised as trade contract assets. 
Payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date for all trade receivables.

Accounting Policy (continued)
(c) T rade contract liabilities
 A trade contract liability represents the obligation of the Group and of the Company to transfer goods or services to a customer for which 
consideration has been received (or the amount is due) from the customers.
 T rade contract liabilities primarily relate to contributions paid by electricity customers for the construction of electricity network  
assets. The customers’ contributions are expected to be recognised as revenue over a period of 20 years, being the estimated average 
useful life of the electricity network assets used to connect the customers to the electricity supply.
 Other trade contract liabilities within the Group are relating to students fees. All other trade contract liabilities are expected to be 
recognised as revenue over the next 12 months.
(d) Non-trade contract assets and liabilities
 Non-trade contract balances are pertaining to insurance and reinsurance contracts which are recognised in accordance to MFRS 4 
‘Insurance Contracts’.
 These balances have been classified as receivables (Note 21) and payables (Note 23) respectively as at 1 January 2023 upon adoption of 
MFRS 17.

20 INVENTORIES
Accounting Policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost of work-in-progress and finished goods comprise raw materials, direct labour and a proportion of the production overheads. Cost is 
determined on the weighted average basis and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their 
present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses.
Accounting Policy
T rade and other receivables
T rade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables 
generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. If collection is expected in one year or 
less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current 
assets.
T rade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain 
significant financing components. The Group and the Company hold the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash 
flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment is determined 
based on the ECL model and is further disclosed in Note 45.
Insurance contracts
Reinsurance contracts - initial recognition
The Group applies the premium allocation approach (‘PAA ’) to all the reinsurance contracts it holds, as: 
• The coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less, including insurance contract services arising from all premiums 
within the contract boundary; or
• For contracts longer than one year , the Group has modelled possible future scenarios and reasonably expects that the measurement 
of the liability for remaining coverage for the Group containing those contracts under the PAA does not differ materially from the 
measurement that would be produced applying the general model. In assessing materiality, the Group has also considered qualitative 
factors such as the nature of the risk and types of its lines of business.

Accounting Policy (continued) 
Insurance contracts (continued)
Reinsurance contracts - initial recognition (continued)
For a group of contracts that is not onerous at initial recognition, the Group measures the liability for remaining coverage as:
• The premiums, if any, received at initial recognition; 
• Minus any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, with the exception of contracts which are one year or less where this is expensed;
• Plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of the asset recognised for insurance acquisition cash flows; and
• Any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before 
the group of insurance contracts is recognised.
The Group calculates the loss-recovery component by multiplying the loss recognised on the underlying insurance contracts and the 
percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held. The 
Group uses a systematic and rational method to determine the portion of losses recognised on the group to insurance contracts covered by 
the group of reinsurance contracts held where some contracts in the underlying group are not covered by the group of reinsurance contracts 
held.
Reinsurance contracts - subsequent measurement
The Group measures the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage at the end of each reporting period as the liability for remaining 
coverage at the beginning of the period:
• Plus premiums received in the period;
• Minus insurance acquisition cash flows, with the exception of property insurance product line for which the Group chooses to expense 
insurance acquisition cash flows as they occur;
• Plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of the insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an expense in the reporting period 
for the group;
• Plus any adjustment to the financing component, where applicable;
• Minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period; and
• Minus any investment component paid or transferred to the liability for incurred claims.
The Group estimates the liability for incurred claims as the fulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims. The fulfilment cash flows incorporate, 
in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty 
of those future cash flows, they reflect current estimates from the perspective of the Group, and include an explicit adjustment for non-
financial risk (the risk adjustment). The Group does not adjust the future cash flows for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk 
for the measurement of liability for incurred claims that are expected to be paid within one year of being incurred.
Where, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, the Group recognises a 
loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows. 
A loss component is established by the Group for the liability for remaining coverage for such onerous group depicting the losses recognised.
Where the Group has established a loss-recovery component, the Group subsequently reduces the loss recovery component to zero in line 
with reductions in the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts in order to reflect that the loss-recovery component shall not exceed 
the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the entity expects to 
recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held. 
Presentation
The Group has presented separately, in the statement of financial position, the carrying amounts of portfolios of reinsurance contracts issued 
that are assets in Note 21 and portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities in Note 23.

Accounting Policy 
T rade and other payables
T rade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. 
Other payables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. T rade and other payables 
are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they 
are presented as non-current liabilities.
T rade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, which is the fair value of the 
consideration to be paid in the future for the goods and services received.

 Credit terms of trade payables of the Group and of the Company vary from 30 to 60 days (2022: 30 to 60 days) depending on the terms of the 
contracts.
Accounting Policy (continued) 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimates of the amounts can be made. Where the 
Group and the Company expect a provision to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar 
obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A 
provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Insurance contract liabilities
The accounting policy on insurance contract assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 21.

24 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Accounting Policy 
The Group and the Company have various post-employment benefit schemes which are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. A 
defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and the Group and the Company have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods.
Defined contribution plans
The Group’s and the Company’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the financial 
year to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group and the Company have no further payment obligations.
Defined benefit plans
The Group and the Company make contributions to the Group and Company’s Retirement Benefit Plan, a defined benefit plan and an approved 
fund independent of the Group and Company’s finances. A book provision is also provided by the Group and the Company as the contribution 
rate required to fund the benefits under the said plan is in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum limit. The Group and the Company also 
provided for a Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees, which is unfunded.
The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date 
minus the fair value of plan assets. The Group and the Company determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value 
of any plan assets with sufficient regularity such that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the 
amounts that would be determined at the end of the reporting date.
The defined benefit obligation, calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, is determined by an independent actuarial firm, considering 
the estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the statement of financial position date of high-quality corporate bonds which have 
currency and terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee services in 
the current year . It is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as employee benefits expense.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefits obligation and the fair value of plan 
assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly to the OCI in the period in which they arise. The actuarial gains and 
losses are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.
(i) Retirement Benefit T rust Fund (‘RBTF’)
 The Group and the Company operate a final salary defined benefit plan. The benefit is made as lump sum payment at retirement or earlier 
exits due to death and early retirement. Currently, there is no minimum funding requirement under the law.
 The RBTF exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates from defined benefit being greater than expected due to 
assumptions such as salary increment or turnover rates not being borne out. The RBTF is also exposed to investment risks in relation to 
the assets of the plan. Any surplus in RBTF will be used to reduce any future contributions to be paid by the Group and the Company.
 The funding of the RBTF is based on recommendation of the actuary and approved by the Group and the Company. The contributions by 
the Group and the Company are based on 7.0% (2022: 7.0%) of the annual basic salaries of the members. The employees are not required 
to contribute to the plan.
 The Group and the Company expect to contribute 6.0% (2022: 6.0%) of the annual basic salaries of members to the plan in the next 
financial year .

(ii) Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Scheme (‘PRMBS’)
 The Group and the Company operate a post-retirement medical benefits plan in Malaysia. The PRMBS is closed to new entrants effective 
on 1 September 1998 and 1 September 1990 for the Group and the Company, respectively. There is no minimum funding requirement 
under the current law. The PRMBS is unfunded.
 The PRMBS exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates and from defined benefits being greater than expected due 
to assumptions such as projection of medical benefit costs and mortality not being borne out.
 There has not been any settlement or curtailment during the current financial year .

25 CONSUMER DEPOSITS
 Consumers are required to deposit a sum sufficient to cover charges for two months supply of electricity as allowed under the regulation of 
the Licensee Supply (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (with the exception of employees, government departments/ agencies and recipients of 
government assistance program for eKasih Group). In default of payment of the deposit within the time specified, the supply to the consumer’s 
installation may be disconnected, subject to certain conditions laid out in the regulations.
 An interest of 2.5% per annum is credited to the consumer’s cash deposit. 
 Consumer deposits are classified as current liabilities as the amounts shall be refunded within 30 days upon request for termination of electricity 
supply by the consumer .
26 BORROWINGS
 
Accounting Policy
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method, any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value are recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.
Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the Group issues equity instruments to a debt holder to extinguish all or part of 
the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognised in statement of comprehensive income, which is measured as the difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued, if any.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or 
all of the facilities will be drawdown. The transaction costs are amortised over the tenure of the loan and recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take 
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. All other borrowing costs are 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Government loans, where the interest rate is below the market interest rate, the differential between the initial carrying value of the loan based 
on market rate and the Government rate is recognised as a deferred income and is credited to the statement of profit or loss over the period 
necessary to match the interest costs.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

31 REVENUE
Accounting Policy
Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group’s and the Company’s ordinary activities is recognised by reference to 
each distinct performance obligation promised in the contracts with customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured at its 
transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group and the Company expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
promised goods or services to a customer , net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. T ransaction price is allocated to 
each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services promised in the contract. 
Depending on the substance of the respective contract with the customer , revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, 
which may be at a point in time or over time.
The Group and the Company do not expect any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the 
customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year . As a consequence, the Group and the Company do not adjust any of the transaction 
prices for the time value of money.
(a) Electricity revenue
 Revenue from the supply of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia (since 2014), Sabah and Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan (since 2022) is regulated 
based on certain formulae and parameters as set out in the regulatory implementation guidance under the IBR framework and as agreed 
with the regulators. The allowed revenue in each year is calculated as the sum of actual revenue earned and any applicable adjustments, 
such as those related to the Annual Regulatory Adjustment (‘ ARA ’), allowance or top-up by the Government and other income adjustment 
mechanisms as described in the Guidelines on Electricity T ariff Determination. 
 The contract with customers is for the supply of electricity based on tariff rates as set out in the provision of the Electricity Supply Act 
1990. Collection of the contract consideration from customers is considered probable.
 The promise to supply electricity represents a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and that have 
the same pattern of transfer to the customer . The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customers 
simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided by the Group’s and the Company’s performance. Hence, electricity revenue 
is recognised over time by the Group and the Company when electricity is consumed by customers.

31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)
Accounting Policy (continued)
(a) Electricity revenue (continued)
 Generally, customers are billed monthly. As the amount at which the Group and the Company have a right to invoice corresponds directly 
with the value to the customer , the revenue from electricity sales is also recognised monthly. Payment should be made by customers 
within 30 days from the date the bill is issued. An interest charge will be imposed if payment is made later than 30 days after the bill date. 
 Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customers from the date of their last meter reading and 
the reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenues recognised as contract assets are reversed in the following month when actual 
billings occur .
 Other income which is earned from services not directly related to electricity supply but are provided using the assets and/or staff of a 
licensee is deducted from the revenues to be earned from regulated tariffs.
(b) Goods and services
(i) Sale of goods
 Sale of goods is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer 
and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the 
products have been transported to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer , 
and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, 
or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
 Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discounts. Accumulated 
experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to 
the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur . No element of financing is deemed present as the sales 
are made with a credit term of an average between 30 to 60 days, which is consistent with market practice. The Group’s obligation 
to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is recognised as a provision.
 A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because 
only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.
(ii) Rendering of services
 Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised based 
on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided because the 
customer received and uses the benefits simultaneously.
 In cases of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered exceed 
the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.
 If the contract includes hourly fees, revenue is recognised at the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice. The amounts 
are billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from the billing 
date.

31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)
Accounting Policy (continued)
(c) Construction contracts
 Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time or at a point in time in accordance with performance obligations being 
satisfied. Where revenue is recognised over time, the satisfaction of performance obligation is by reference to the stage of completion 
which is assessed by reference to the contract costs incurred over the total estimated costs for each contract as at the reporting date. 
Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the assets. The related costs are recognised in 
the statement of profit or loss when they are incurred.
 Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation 
based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. 
If contracts include sale of goods as a separate performance obligation, revenue from this sale is recognised at a point in time when the 
goods are delivered, the legal title has passed and the customer has accepted the goods. 
 When the consideration of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of 
contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of 
profit or loss.
 Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or 
decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that 
give rise to the revision become known by management. 
 The amounts will be billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days 
from billing date. Advances received are included in contract liabilities.
(d) Customers’ contributions
 Contributions received from customers in the form of cash and/or PPE in respect of capital contributions for the construction of assets, 
used to connect the customers to a network or to provide them with the service, is included in the revenue.
 The customers’ contributions are viewed as indirectly related to the promise of providing supply of electricity to the customers. Supply 
of electricity and customers’ contributions are not distinct because the customers cannot benefit from these two services on their 
own. The connection infrastructures are to fulfil the obligation to supply electricity to the customers. Both the supply of electricity and 
customers’ contributions are substantially the same, and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers.
 Therefore, connection and the supply of electricity are one performance obligation. It is considered as part of the transaction price for 
the overall service provided to the customers and is recognised over time. The customers’ contributions are deferred and recognised 
over the period the constructed assets are used to provide electricity to the customers. The contributions are recognised as contract 
liabilities and amortised over 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the assets.
(e) Insurance contract revenue
 Insurance revenue is recognised based on the expected premium receipts and the passage of time over the coverage period of a group 
of contracts unless the release of risk differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case insurance revenue is recognised based 
on the release of risk.

Accounting Policy
ICPT , a mechanism established under the IBR framework allows the Group and the Company to pass through the volatility in fuel and other 
generation specific costs (termed as the ‘Single Buyer Generation Cost’) to the customers, such that the Group and the Company remain 
financially neutral. The Group’s and the Company’s claims and undertakings under the ICPT mechanism are such that any over or under 
recovery of these costs would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government. Upon approval by the Government, the agreed over or 
under recovery costs will be adjusted in the billing to customers, as ICPT rebate or surcharge. Actual base tariff billed to the customers remains 
unchanged.
The ICPT over or under recovery is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, presented separately from revenue.

 L TIP
 The Group and the Company operate an equity-settled share-based compensation plan under which the entity receives services from employees 
as consideration for equity instruments of the Group.
 The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the Company’s shares is recognised as an expense in the statement 
of profit or loss over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity.
 The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted.
 Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions to arrive at the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of the 
reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be vested. The impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to share-based payment reserve in equity.
 The fair value of shares granted to employees of subsidiaries is allocated to the subsidiaries.
 The Company implemented a L TIP on 30 April 2015 for a period of 10 years. The L TIP is governed by the by-laws, which was approved by the 
shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 18 December 2014. L TIP is intended to allow the Company to award the grant of new shares 
to be vested to selected employees for the attainment of identified performance objectives.
(a) The main features of the L TIP
 The L TIP comprises a Restricted Share Grant (‘RS Grant’) and a Performance Share Grant (‘PS Grant’). The main difference in the features 
of the RS Grant and the PS Grant is the eligibility of the selected employees in terms of their job grades in the Group and the performance 
targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant to the selected employees.
 The details of the grant are as follows:
(i) RS Grant
 The RS Grant is a restricted share grant for all eligible employees selected on a basis designated by the L TIP Committee. The RS Grant 
will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested over a period of 3 years on a pro-rata basis and after fulfilment of 
individual performance targets based on the Group’s performance management system (such as individual performance rating) and 
certain performance conditions (such as financial targets) as determined by the L TIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the L TIP .

(a) The main features of the L TIP (continued)
 The details of the grant are as follows: (continued)
(ii) PS Grant
 The PS Grant is a performance share grant for senior executives of the Group and the Executive Director as well as key employees of 
the Group selected on a basis designated by the L TIP Committee. The PS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to 
be vested at the end of the 3-year period and after fulfilment of certain performance targets and/or conditions at the time of grant and 
vesting, which may include, among other factors, total shareholders’ return and the long term financial performance targets/ratios of 
the Group as determined by the L TIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
L TIP . At the point of vesting, the final award of the PS Grant is based on a multiple of the initial grant whereby the multiple is determined 
according to the performance targets and/or conditions. In the event the performance targets and/or conditions are not met by the 
selected employees, the grant will not be vested to them at the end of the performance period.
 The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued upon the vesting of the ordinary shares pursuant to the RS Grant and PS Grant will not 
be subjected to any retention period or restriction on transfer .
 In implementing the L TIP , the grant will be satisfied by way of allotment and issuance of new ordinary shares to the respective RS and PS 
grantees upon vesting of the grant.
 The L TIP Committee shall decide from time to time at its discretion to determine or vary the terms and conditions of the offer , such as 
the eligibility criteria and allocation in each grant, the timing and frequency of the award of the grant, the performance targets and/or 
performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant and the vesting period.
(b) Maximum number of new ordinary shares available under the L TIP
 The maximum number of new ordinary shares which may be made available under the L TIP and/or allotted and issued upon vesting of the 
new ordinary shares under the L TIP shall not be more than 10.0% of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) at any point in time during the duration of the L TIP .
(c) Basis of allocation and maximum allowable allotment
 The total number of new ordinary shares that may be offered to any one of the selected employees and/or to be vested in any one of the 
grantees under the L TIP at any time shall be at the discretion of the L TIP Committee (subject to the by-laws and any applicable law).
(d) Eligibility
 Employees of the Group and of the Company (including the Executive Director) who meet the following criteria as at the date of offer shall be 
eligible to be considered as an eligible employee to participate in the L TIP:
(i) Has attained the age of 18 years;
(ii) Has entered into a full-time or fixed-term contract of employment with, and is on the payroll of any company within the Group and has 
not served a notice of resignation or received a notice of termination;
(iii) Whose service/employment has been confirmed in writing;
(iv) Is not a non-executive or independent director of the Company; and
(v) Has fulfilled any other eligibility criteria which has been determined by the L TIP Committee at its discretion from time to time, as the 
case may be. 
 The L TIP Committee may determine any other eligibility criteria for the purpose of selecting an eligible employee at any time and from time 
to time, at its discretion.

credited into the Central Depository System (‘CDS’) accounts of the respective grantees upon vesting of the grant under the L TIP .
(f) Alteration of share capital and adjustment
 If the L TIP Committee so decides (but not otherwise), in the event of any alteration in the capital structure of the Company during the duration 
of L TIP , which expires on 29 April 2025, such corresponding alterations (if any) may be made to the L TIP in:

Accounting Policy
(a) Functional and presentation currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (‘RM’), 
which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(b) T ransactions and balances
 Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. However , exchange differences are deferred in OCI when they are attributable to items 
that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
(c) Group companies
 The results and financial positions of the Group’s entities that have functional currencies which are different from the presentation 
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
statement of financial position;
(ii) Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and OCI are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
 Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on these items are recognised in OCI.
 On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ 
equity.
 On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss 
of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a 
foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), the cumulative 
amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in OCI, and accumulated in the separate component of 
equity, are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Accounting Policy
Finance income are interests received from investments or financial instruments.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Finance income is calculated by applying the effective interest method to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial 
assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For credit impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying 
amount of the financial assets (after deduction of the loss allowances). 
The accounting policy on fair value changes are as per disclosed in Note 45.
General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are 
capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Qualifying assets are assets that 
necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they 
are incurred.
Accounting policy on finance charges for lease liabilities and government grants are disclosed in Notes 15 and Note 27, respectively.

Accounting Policy
(a) Income tax
 Current tax expense is determined by the expected income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial year and is 
measured using the applicable tax rates according to the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in 
the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate the taxable profits.
 Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in its tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations 
are subject to interpretation. Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities.
 T ax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in OCI. In this case, the 
item is recognised in OCI, net of tax.
 The Group and the Company recognise non-current tax recoverable on an undiscounted basis.
(b) Zakat
 The Group and the Company recognise its obligation towards the payment of zakat on business income in the statement of profit or loss. 
Zakat payment is an obligation and is accrued based on 2.5% of profit before tax and determined according to the percentage of Muslim 
shareholding in the Company.

42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MA TERIAL LITIGA TIONS
Accounting Policy
The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets and liabilities other than those arising from business combinations, but 
disclose its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence 
will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the 
Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare case where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be 
measured reliably. However , contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises 
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the Group and of the Company. The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose its existence where 
inflows of economic benefits are probable, but not certain.
Determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities is based on the Group’s and the Company’s view of the expected outcome of the 
contingencies after consulting legal counsel for litigation cases and internal and external experts to the Group and the Company for matters in 
the ordinary course of business.

 Contingent liabilities (continued)
 All third party claims are being resolved and the Directors are of the opinion that their outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on the 
financial positions of both the Group and the Company.
 Claims by third parties include claims by contractors, consumers and statutory body. These claims are being addressed and the Directors are of the 
opinion that their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group and the Company.
 T rade guarantees and performance bonds provided to third parties for the benefit of the Group and the Company are for normal and ongoing 
business requirements consistent with generally acceptable and recognised industry practices. The liability would only trigger upon the default 
of the Group’s and the Company’s obligations under the guarantees and bonds. At the reporting date, the likelihood of the guarantees and bonds 
being called upon is remote. 
 Material litigations
(a) Reinvestment allowance (‘RIA ’)
 On 7 December 2016, the Company and the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (‘IRB') entered into a consent judgement before the Kuala 
Lumpur High Court to substitute judicial review proceedings for notices of additional assessment dated 23 November 2015 for Years of 
Assessment (‘YA') 2013 and 2014 amounting to RM2,068.2 million (referred to as 'Notices 1') arising from the disallowance of the Company's 
RIA claims. The consent judgement also stipulates that the IRB will not commence any proceedings relating to the Notices 1 until the matter 
is determined by the Special Commissioners of Income T ax ('SCIT') and the High Court, if there is a subsequent appeal by either party. On 15 
December 2016, the Company filed appeals against the Notices 1 to the SCIT according to Section 99(1) of the Income T ax Act 1967, which 
have since been registered before the SCIT . However , the hearing at SCIT is adjourned pending the Court of Appeal's decision on 16 May 2024 
in relation to notice of additional assessment for the YA 2018.
 Meanwhile, for the notices of additional assessment issued for the YAs 2015, 2016, and 2017 amounting to RM3,977.9 million (referred to as 
'Notices 2'), both the Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 30 December 
2020. On 22 August 2023, the High Court allowed the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notices 2. The High Court agreed 
that the Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditures 
which were incurred in the YAs 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the course of expanding, modernising and automating its business. In response, on 25 
August 2023, the IRB filed a notice of appeal against the High Court's decision. The Court of Appeal has fixed the hearing date on 3 October 
2024.
 With regards to the notice of additional assessment for the YA 2018 amounting to RM1,812.5 million (referred to as 'Notice 3'), both the 
Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 21 January 2021. On 8 February 
2022, the High Court allowed with cost, the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notice 3. The High Court agreed that the 
Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditure which 
was incurred in the YA 2018 in the course of expanding, modernising and automating its business. Separately, on 8 February 2022, the IRB filed 
a notice of appeal against the High Court's decision. Subsequent to the hearing and case management at the Court of Appeal on 6 February 
2024 and 7 February 2024 respectively, the Court of Appeal has fixed the decision date on 16 May 2024.
 The Company has obtained legal advice from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases mentioned above and on this basis, the Directors are 
of the opinion that there is no possible obligation, therefore no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential tax liability 
up to the reporting date.
 Notwithstanding with the above, the Company continued to claim the RIA for YAs 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 based on the legal advice, as the 
Directors of the view that it is permitted by the law.

 Material litigations (continued)
(b) KEV
 On 29 October 2021, the IRB disallowed the interest expenses incurred by KEV in relation to the Redeemable Unsecured Loan Stock granted 
to KEV by the Company and Malakoff Corporation Berhad under Section 33(1)(a) of the Income T ax Act 1967 and KEV's revision of revenue 
for YAs 2004 to 2009. As a result thereof, the IRB issued notices of assessment for the YAs 2011, 2012 and 2014 and notices of additional 
assessment for the YAs 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 amounting in aggregate to RM595.9 million.
 On 16 November 2021, KEV commenced a judicial review against the Minister of Finance at the High Court to challenge the matters arising 
from the above-mentioned notices. Pursuant to an out-of-court settlement with the IRB, KEV has withdrawn the judicial review application 
before the High Court on 21 June 2023. 
 The out-of-court settlement had no material impact to the Group's financial position.
(c) Southern Power Generation Sdn. Bhd. ('SPG')
 On 26 May 2023, the IRB issued notices of assessment for YAs 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 amounting in aggregate to RM78.5 million to 
SPG.
 On 6 June 2023, SPG filed a judicial review against the IRB at the High Court to challenge the matters arising from the above-mentioned 
notices. Subsequently, on 14 September 2023, the High Court granted leave to SPG to commence judicial review against the IRB and granted 
an interim stay of all further proceedings including the enforcement until the substantive hearing on 11 January 2024. Due to an ongoing 
discussion with a view to a proposed settlement with the IRB, the substantive hearing was vacated. The High Court has fixed a new hearing 
date on 28 March 2024.
 Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the case, SPG is of the view that the proposed settlement with IRB 
will not have a material impact to the financial statements.
 Notwithstanding with the above, SPG continued to claim tax deductions for YAs 2022 and 2023 as permitted by the law.

45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Accounting Policy
Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below:
Financial assets
(a) Classification
 The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following categories: at amortised cost (‘ AC’), at FVOCI or FVTPL. The 
classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
(i) Financial assets at AC:
• The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and
• The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.
(ii) Financial assets at FVOCI:
• Equity securities which are not held for trading, and which the Group and the Company have irrevocably elected at initial 
recognition to recognise in this category. These are strategic investments and the Group and the Company consider this 
classification to be more relevant; and
• Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s business model is achieved both by collecting cash flows and selling financial assets.
(iii) Financial assets at FVTPL:
• Debt instruments that do not qualify for measurement at either AC or FVOCI;
• Equity instruments that are held for trading; and
• Equity instruments for which the Group and the Company have not elected to recognise fair value gains and losses through 
OCI.
 The Group and the Company reclassify debt instruments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.
(b) Recognition and derecognition
 Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit 
to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
(c) Measurement
(i) Initial recognition
 On initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset 
not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. T ransaction costs of financial 
assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.
 Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely 
payment of principal and interest.

Financial assets (continued)
(c) Measurement (continued)
(ii) Subsequent measurement
• Debt instruments
 Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s and the Company’s business model for managing the 
asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the 
Company classify its debt instruments:
- AC: Interest income from financial assets at AC is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. 
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses are 
presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
- FVOCI: Movements in the carrying amount of debt instruments classified under FVOCI are taken through OCI. Upon 
derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement 
of profit or loss. The interest income from these financial assets is included in the finance income using the effective 
interest rate method. The foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line 
item in the statement of profit or loss.
- FVTPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on debt 
instruments which are measured at FVTPL are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
• Equity instruments
 The Group and the Company have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity instruments in OCI. The fair value 
gains and losses of these instruments will not be reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit or loss. Dividends 
from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as other income. Impairment losses (and reversal of 
impairment losses) on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are also reported as other changes in fair value.
(d) Impairment
 The Group and the Company assess on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at 
AC and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
 The Group and the Company have the following financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
(i) T rade receivables
(ii) T rade contract assets
(iii) Non-trade receivables:
• intercompany balances
• amounts due from associates/joint ventures
• rechargeable job orders (‘RJO’) debtors 
• sundry deposits for rental spaces
• rental receivables
• staff loans/ advances
• investment in unquoted debt securities
(iv) Financial guarantee contracts issued
While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss is immaterial.

Accounting Policy (continued)
Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)
Financial assets (continued)
(d) Impairment (continued)
 ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between the present value of the cash flows according to the 
contract and present value of the cash flows the Group and the Company are expected to receive, over the remaining life of the financial 
instruments. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to be reimbursed to the holder 
of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Company expects to receive from the holder , the debtor or any other party.
 The measurement of ECL reflects:
(i) An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
(ii) The time value of money; and 
(iii) Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, 
current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
 For trade receivables, trade contract assets and lease receivables, the Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach, 
which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, except for those which are in default 
or credit impaired are assessed individually.
 For non-trade receivables, at each reporting date the Group and the Company measure ECL through a loss allowance at an amount equal 
to 12 months ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial 
recognition. 
 The Group and the Company use the three-stage approach for non-trade receivables which reflect their credit risks and how the loss 
allowances are determined for each of those stages. Summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group’s and the Company’s ECL 
model for non-trade receivables are as follows:
T ypes of non-trade 
receivables

Low credit risk

Accounting Policy (continued)
Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)
Financial assets (continued)
(d) Impairment (continued)
 When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating 
ECL, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost 
or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical 
experience and informed credit assessment including forward looking information, where available. 
 The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or fully) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of 
recovery. This is generally the case when either the Group or the Company determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources 
of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write off. However , financial assets that are 
written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s and the Company’s procedures for recovery 
of amounts due.
Financial liabilities
The Group and the Company classify its financial liabilities at AC or at FVTPL. 
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offsetted and the net amounts are presented in the statement of financial position when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business 
and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
Financial guarantee contracts
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group or the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a 
loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair 
value and subsequently at the higher of;
(i) The amount determined in accordance with the ECL model; and
(ii) The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles 
of MFRS 15.
The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual payments 
under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to 
a third party for assuming the obligations.
Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates are provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as 
contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

(b) Financial risk management
 The Group and the Company have exposures to the following risks embedded in its financial instruments:
• Credit risk;
• Liquidity risk; and
• Market risk.
 Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations. The Group’s and the Company’s exposures to credit risk arise principally from its receivables from customers, 
investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances and derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company’s 
exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries and financial guarantees given to banks in respect of banking 
facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate.

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group and the Company have a credit policy in place and the exposures to credit risk are monitored on an ongoing basis. Normally, 
financial guarantees given by banks, shareholders or directors of customers are obtained, and credit evaluations are performed on 
customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 The Group’s and the Company’s credit policy provide trade receivables with a 30 to 90 days (2022: 30 to 90 days) credit period. The 
Group and the Company have no major significant concentration of credit risk due to their diverse customer base. An impairment 
has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience of individual debtors and 
collection portfolios.
 The total trade receivables and trade contract assets and the impairment provided are as follows:

 The Group and the Company apply MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss 
allowance for all trade receivables and trade contract assets.
 For certain large customers with high risk of default, the Group and the Company assessed the risk of loss for each customer individually 
based on their financial information, past trend of payments and external credit ratings, where applicable.
 T o measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and trade contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics 
and the days past due. The trade contract assets that relate to unbilled customers have substantial same risk characteristics as the 
trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group and the Company have therefore concluded that the expected loss rates 
for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates of the trade contract assets.

(i) T rade receivables and trade contract assets (continued)
 Impairment losses (continued)
 The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 14 months and the corresponding historical credit 
losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on 
macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group and the Company have identified 
growth rates of real Gross Domestic Product (‘GDP’) of Malaysia to be the most relevant factor , and accordingly, adjusts the historical 
loss rates based on the expected changes in this factor . As at 31 December 2023, for non-government customers, a combination of 
growth rates of real GDP and inflation rates were identified as the most relevant factors.
 On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for both trade receivables and trade contract assets as reflected in the earlier tables.
 During the financial year , the collection trends of the Group’s and the Company’s trade receivables continued to improve. The Group 
and the Company revised the expected cash flows from their trade receivables which resulted in a reversal of impairment loss.
 The Group and the Company also written off the inactive trade receivables which had been fully impaired in the previous financial years, 
therefore there was no impact to the net trade receivables.
 The opening loss allowances for trade receivables and trade contract assets reconciled to the closing loss allowances are as follows:

 T rade receivables are secured by deposits in the form of cash and bank guarantees. ECL is not provided on receivable balances fully 
secured by deposits. The deposit amounts are reviewed on an individual basis periodically.
 Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by reducing the carrying amount directly.
 Impairment losses on trade receivables and trade contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. 
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.
(ii) Investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets at FVTPL
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 Investments, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets measured at FVTPL are liquid 
security and mainly with reputable financial institutions.
 Investment in unquoted debt security are investment in an associate’s financial instruments. The credit risk of this associate is 
monitored on a quarterly basis and the loss allowances are provided for accordingly.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the SOFP .
 In view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, the Group and the Company do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its 
obligations. The Group and the Company do not have overdue investments that have not been impaired.
 The investments, deposits, cash and bank balances and derivative financial instruments are unsecured.
 Bank and cash balances are held with banks and financial institutions which have lower credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances 
are insured by Government agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material 
and hence, it is not provided for .

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the results of the subsidiaries 
regularly.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 At the end of the financial year , the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP .
 The total amounts due from subsidiaries and impairment provided are as follows:

 Impairment losses
 Generally, the Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries having low credit risk. The Company assumes that there is 
a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary’s financial position deteriorates significantly based on stages determined 
in the accounting policy part (d) of this note. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the subsidiaries’ 
balances when they are payable, the Company considers the amount payable to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to 
pay when demanded. The Company considers a subsidiary’s balances to be impaired when the subsidiary is:
- unlikely to repay its payables to the Company in full; 
- having prolonged negative operating cash flows and is in net tangible liabilities position; or
- a dormant entity or has a history of default.
 At the end of the financial year , there was no indication that the amounts due from the subsidiaries are not recoverable other than 
those which have already been impaired. The Company does not specifically monitor the ageing of advances to the subsidiaries.
 During the financial year , there has been reversal of loss allowances due to repayments received from subsidiaries.

 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 Credit risk on other non-trade receivables are mainly arising from RJO debtors which are receivables from specific works 
requested by customers. 
 Credit risk also arises from sundry deposits for rental of office spaces from third parties and rental receivables. The Company 
manages the credit risk together with the specific leasing arrangements.
 Staff advances and staff loans have low credit risk as these are mostly provided to existing staff. These balances are managed on 
a monthly basis.
 Amounts due from associates and joint ventures are mostly due to transactions within the Group and have a low credit risk. These 
balances are managed on a monthly basis.
 Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
 At the end of the financial year , the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP .
 The Company receives down payments, LOUs or indents for RJO debtors where works are requested by customers. In cases of 
RJO debtors arising from accidental damages to the Company’s assets whereby the third party is identifiable, these amounts are 
fully impaired as there is very low prospect of recovery.
 The Company receives deposits from third parties for rental of office spaces. 
 For staff loans and staff advances, any repayment is done through monthly payroll deductions.

 Credit risk (continued) 
(iv) Financial guarantees (continued)
 Impairment losses
 The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary or associate has indication of defaulting on 
its banking facilities. The Company considers a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when the subsidiary or associate is unlikely to 
repay its credit obligation to the bank in full.
 The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually using internal information available.
 Loss allowance has been recognised mainly arising from the financial guarantee provided by the Group in 2016 to support the loan 
facility offered to İç Anadolu Doğalgaz Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret A.Ş. (‘ICAN’), a subsidiary of Gama Enerji Anonîm Şîrketî ('Gama Enerji').  
The ECL is determined based on an internal assessment of Gama Enerji debt servicing ability taking into account of the current adverse 
macroeconomic conditions in T ürkiye. The impairment loss for financial guarantees for the Group and the Company are in Stage 3.
 The movement in the loss allowances of financial guarantees during the financial year was:

 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s and the 
Company’s exposures to liquidity risk arise principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings. The Group and the Company monitor 
rolling forecasts of the Group’s and of the Company’s liquidity requirements.
 As of 31 December 2023, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM2,120.3 million (2022: RM1,434.6 million), 
mainly due to consumer deposits amounting to RM7,659.6 million (2022: RM7,185.7 million).
 The Company’s cash flow forecast for the next 12 months takes into account the expected revenue growth rates, customer collection 
trends, low rate of termination of electricity account that would crystallise the entire consumer deposits above and one-off transactions. 
The Company expects to be able to generate sufficient internal cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the reporting date to 
meet operational and financing needs as and when they fall due.
 In addition, as at 31 December 2023, the Company have undrawn borrowing facilities amounting to RM14,011.4 million (2022: RM10,815.6 
million) to support any cash shortfall while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all times to ensure the 
Company have the financial flexibility.
 Surplus cash of the Group and of the Company is invested in profit bearing current accounts, money market deposits and other instruments 
with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity level to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the cash flow forecasts and to 
enable the Group and the Company to discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.

 Currency risk sensitivity analysis
 A 10.0% strengthening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have decreased post-tax profit or loss 
by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores 
any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

 A 10.0% weakening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have had equal but opposite effect on the 
above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remained constant.
 Foreign currency risk for the Group and the Company which have a functional currency other than USD, JPY , EUR and GBP are not 
material and hence, sensitivity analysis is not presented.
(ii) Interest rate risk
 The Group’s and the Company’s investments in fixed rate debt security and its fixed rate borrowings are not exposed to a significant risk 
of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group’s and the Company’s variable rate borrowings are exposed to a 
risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investment in equity security and short term receivables and payables are 
not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

Floating rate instrument:
Financial liabilities 4,132.7 1,481.8 0 0
 The financial assets are not sensitive to interest rate changes.
 A 5.0% change in the interest rates of the financial liabilities with floating interest rates at the end of the financial year would have 
affected the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss and equity by RM0.7 million (2022: RM0.1 million). This analysis assumes that all 
other variables, in particular foreign currency rates remained constant.
(iii) Other price risk
 Other price risk arises from the Group’s and the Company’s investments in equity security, debt security and unit trust funds.
 Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
 The Group and the Company are exposed to price risk because the investments held are classified on the statement of financial position 
as FVOCI and FVTPL. The Group and the Company mainly invest in unit trust funds, primarily in short term deposits as underlying 
instruments with minimal price risk.

45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(b) Financial risk management (continued)
 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)
(i) Policy on transfer between levels
 The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that 
caused the transfer .
 There were no transfers between levels during the financial year .
(ii) Level 1 fair value
 Level 1 fair value is derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access 
at the measurement date.
(iii) Level 2 fair value
 Level 2 fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets 
or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.
 Derivative financial instruments
 The fair value is estimated by the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual 
maturity of the contract.
 Non-derivative financial instruments
 Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purpose, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash 
flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.
(iv) Level 3 fair value
 Level 3 fair values for the financial assets and liabilities are estimated using unobservable inputs.
(v) Interest rates used to determine fair value
 The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, when applicable, ranging between 0.1% to 8.0% (2022: 0.1% to 8.0%).
 Although the Group and the Company believe that their estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or 
assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
 The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been calculated by recalibrating the 
model values using expected cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates based on the probability weighted average of the Group’s and 
of the Company’s ranges of possible outcomes.

46 CAPIT AL RISK MANAGEMENT
 The Group’s and the Company’s main objective of capital management is to safeguard the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group and the Company will also strive to maintain an 
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
 For the purpose of sustaining or changing the capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.
 In order to be consistent with industry norms, the Group and the Company monitor its capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio 
is calculated as total borrowings divided by capital employed. T otal borrowings include non-current borrowings and current borrowings as shown in 
the consolidated statement of financial position. Capital employed is the summation of total equity and total borrowings.

47 REST A TEMENT
(a) Financial assets at FVOCI
 During the year , the Group and the Company changed the presentation of the fair value changes of financial assets measured at FVOCI as 
‘Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss’ within the statements of comprehensive income from ‘Items that maybe 
reclassified subsequently to profit or loss’ previously. There is no change to OCI or total comprehensive income for the Group and the 
Company.
(b) Reclassification for deposits maturing more than 90 days
 
 The Group also changed the classification of the cash flows relating to placements and withdrawals of deposits maturing more than 90 days 
from the date of acquisition. These cash flows are separately classified as ‘Cash Flows from Investing Activities’ in the consolidated statement 
of cash flows. They were previously classified as ‘Cash Flows from Financing Activities’. The change had no impact on the net decrease in cash 
and cash equivalents during the year or the total cash and cash equivalents balance.
 The following table shows the adjustments for each individual line item. Line items that were not affected by the changes have not been 
included.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 
Our opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial 
year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 
2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and 
statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, comprising material 
accounting policies and other explanatory information, as set out on pages 202 to 362.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the “ Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian 
Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional 
Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Our audit approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company. In particular , we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk 
of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into 
account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company 
operate.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company for the current financial year . These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Revenue recognition for sales of electricity
Refer to Note 31 - Revenue
Sales of electricity of RM51,713.2 million and RM48,223.3 million is the 
most significant component of the Group’s and the Company’s revenue, 
respectively, for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.
Revenue from sales of electricity is based on the end customers’ 
consumption and the related tariff rates, which are governed by the 
Incentive Based Regulations imposed by the Energy Commission.
We focused on the revenue recognition for sales of electricity as it 
involves the use of complex billing and accounting systems to process 
large volumes of data with different tariffs based on respective customer 
categories and consumption.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• Tested the overall information technology general controls of the 
billing and accounting systems recording the revenue transactions;
• Tested the application controls within the billing systems over the 
following:
- maintenance of tariff rates in the billing systems;
- accuracy of calculation of amounts billed to customers; and
- recording of revenue transactions;
• Tested the billings and revenue adjustments on a sampling basis to 
assess whether the revenue recognised and revenue adjustments are 
valid and recorded accurately; and
• Examined the correspondence with the Energy Commission and 
assessed whether there were any material matters that would affect 
revenue recognition.
Based on the above procedures performed, we did not find any material 
exceptions.
Reinvestment allowance (‘RIA ’) claims
Refer to Note 4 – Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Note 
42 - Contingent Liabilities and Material Litigations
The Inland Revenue Board (‘IRB’) had disallowed the Company’s RIA 
claims for the Years of Assessment (‘YAs’) 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 
and 2018 and had issued notices of additional assessments (‘Notices’) to 
the Company, amounting in aggregate to RM7,858.6 million.
As at 31 December 2023, the Group and Company recorded a tax 
recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and have not recorded the potential 
tax liabilities of RM6,101.4 million arising from the tax impact if the RIA 
claims are disallowed and the Company loses its appeal. Based on the 
legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases, the 
Directors are of the opinion that no provision is required in the financial 
statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.
We focused on this area due to the inherent uncertainties involved in 
the outcome of judgement on the RIA by the Special Commissioners of 
Income T ax and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, including the subsequent 
notice of appeal filed by the IRB before the Court of Appeal.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• Evaluated the Directors’ assessment on the basis of recoverability 
of the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million in respect of RIA and the 
potential tax liabilities of RM6,101.4 million in respect of RIA by the 
IRB by assessing the independent legal confirmations obtained from 
management’s external legal counsel; and
• Examined the correspondence between the Company and the tax 
authority and assessed the matters in dispute based on advice from 
our tax experts to review the basis of applying the relevant tax laws.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors’ judgement in the treatment of the tax 
recoverable balance and the potential tax liabilities.

Assessment on carrying value of post-employment benefits
Refer to Note 4 – Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Note 
24 – Employee Benefits
As at 31 December 2023, the Group recorded post-employment benefit 
asset of RM147.1 million and post-employment benefit liabilities of 
RM12,371.1 million while the Company recorded post-employment 
benefit asset of RM147.1 million and post-employment benefit liabilities 
of RM11,613.7 million.
Management assessed the present value of post-employment 
benefit plans by relying on the actuarial valuation reports from an 
actuary. The actuarial valuation reports estimated the present value of  
post-employment benefit plans based on key assumptions that 
comprised expected rate of salary increases, medical cost inflation and 
discount rates.
We focused on this area because of the significant estimates made by 
management in determining the present value of post-employment 
benefit plans.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• Obtained an understanding of the terms and conditions of the  
post-employment benefit plans; and
• Tested the present value of post-employment benefit plans based on 
the actuarial valuation reports by performing the following:
- Discussed with the actuary on the valuation method used and 
checked that the valuation method is acceptable in accordance with 
MFRS 119 "Employee Benefits";
- Discussed with the actuary on the key assumptions used in the 
actuarial valuation and checked the reasonableness by comparing to 
historical data;
- Checked the reasonableness of the discount rates with the 
assistance of our valuation experts by comparing to market yields of 
high quality government securities at the reporting date;
- Checked the membership data used in the actuarial models through 
inspection of payroll personnel files and other supporting documents; 
and 
- Compared the fair value of plan assets based on the actuary report 
against the trustee’s report.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors’ estimates of the post-employment benefits 
carrying value.

100% equity interest in the Spark Renewables Group for a purchase 
consideration of RM1,184.9 million. The Group assessed the acquisition 
of these subsidiaries as a business acquisition in accordance with MFRS 3

adjustments. The provisional goodwill recognised amounted to RM332.4 
million.
Acquisition of Spark Renewables Group
We performed the following audit procedures:
• Agreed purchase consideration to the share sale agreement;
• Obtained and discussed the PPA report prepared by an external party 
for the acquisition to assess the appropriateness of the identification 
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; 
• Assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, in particular , 
asset useful life, plant performance, electricity prices and operating 
expenses, used in the underlying cash flows projections adopted in the 
PPA exercise by comparing these assumptions against due diligence 
reports, existing agreements and market outlook; 
• Engaged our internal valuation experts to perform the following:
- assess the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by 
management in determining the fair value of the identified assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with MFRS 13 “Fair 
Value Measurement”; 
- assess the reasonableness of valuation of the intangible assets 
acquired by way of benchmarking precedent market transactions 
involving companies in a similar industry and recomputation based 
on independent market data; and
- assess the reasonableness of the discount rate used in the underlying 
cash flow projections;

Business Combination – Acquisitions during the financial year 
(continued) 
Acquisitions of Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited  
On 20 December 2023, the Group completed its acquisitions of 100% 
equity interests in both Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited for 
a purchase consideration of RM494.0 million. The Group assessed the 
acquisitions of these subsidiaries as a business acquisition in accordance 
with MFRS 3 “Business Combinations”.
Based on the PPA exercise performed, the fair value of identifiable net 
assets recognised on the date of acquisition was RM335.3 million, of 
which RM84.6 million relates to fair value adjustments. The provisional 
goodwill recognised amounted to RM158.7 million.
We focused on this area because the determination of fair values in 
the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the 
identification of intangible assets, requires significant judgement in 
estimating the underlying assumptions to be applied.
Acquisition of Spark Renewables Group (continued)
We performed the following audit procedures: (continued)
• Checked the calculation of the provisional goodwill arising from 
the acquisition, being the difference between the total purchase 
consideration and the provisional fair values of identification net assets 
acquired; and
• Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures relating 
to the acquisition in the Group's consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions of Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited
We performed the following audit procedures:
• Agreed purchase consideration to the share purchase agreements; 
• Assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, in particular , 
asset useful lives, electricity prices and operating expenses, used in 
the underlying cash flows projections adopted in the PPA exercise by 
comparing these assumptions against due diligence reports, existing

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material 
exceptions to the Directors' judgements with respect to the key 
assumptions applied to the PPA exercises of the acquisitions.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon (continued)
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error . 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional 
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error , 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error , as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s internal control.
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the 
Directors.
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or on the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or , if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However , future events or conditions may cause the 
Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL ST A TEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, 
and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves 
fair presentation.
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to 
eliminate threats or safeguards applied. 
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report 
unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not 
be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULA TORY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are 
disclosed in Note 49 to the financial statements.
OTHER MA TTERS
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no 
other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

reviewed in three (3) years’ time.

after the 33 rd AGM of the Company, therefore, the approval of the payment of Director’s fee since his appointment until the 34 th AGM shall be sought at this AGM.
