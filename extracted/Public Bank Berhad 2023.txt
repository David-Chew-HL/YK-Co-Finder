The Malaysian Economy Continued to Gain
Momentum Driven by Resilient Domestic Demand
BANK FOR THE PEOPLE
The theme of Public Bank’s 2023 Annual Report titled 
“Bank for the People” is the core of the Public Bank 
Group’s vision and commitment. 
Since its founding by the late Tan Sri Dato’ Sri Dr. Teh 
Hong Piow in 1966, the Bank has been steadfastly 
guided by its Corporate Philosophy with people-centric 
approach staying as an integral part of the Group’s 
corporate culture and business strategies. 
The Corporate Philosophy is deeply rooted in the Public 
Bank Group’s operations and the Group emphasises on 
delivering long term value to its stakeholders – from 
sustainable shareholder return, superior customer service, 
sound corporate governance, to staff well-being – and 
the Group has continued to uphold its Corporate 
Philosophy till today.
The Public Bank Group’s commitment to its stakeholders 
continued to be reflected in its achievements and 
performance in 2023. For the year, the Public Bank 
Group recorded another solid financial performance, with 
its net profit attributable to shareholders growing by 8.7% 
to RM6.65 billion. 
In addition to its commendable financial performance, the 
Public Bank Group continued to maintain high cost 
efficiency and sound asset quality. 
2023 was a year filled with an unprecedented 
mix of challenges. High inflation, slower-than-
expected recovery of China’s economy, tighter 
global monetary policy and the Middle East 
conflict disrupted the post pandemic recovery, 
leading to a slow global economic growth. 
Navigating these challenges, the Malaysian 
economy continued to gain momentum driven 
by resilient domestic demand. The improved 
employment market and ongoing multi-year 
investment projects continued to support 
economic growth. The Government has also laid 
out pragmatic development plans, such as the 
New Industrial Master Plan 2030 and Mid Term 
Review of the 12th Malaysian Plan to further 
strengthen the country’s growth prospects for 
the medium to long term. 
Riding on these growth opportunities, coupled 
with the sound domestic banking system, the 
Malaysian banking sector continued to play its 
role as an effective and efficient financial 
intermediary supporting the nation’s development.

REVIEW BY
MANAGING DIRECTOR/
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER
The global environment in 2023 was challenging. Many 
countries faced multi-faceted challenges stemming from 
high inflation, geopolitical tensions and tighter monetary 
policy, which had led to subdued economic growth. On 
the domestic front, however, the Malaysian economy 
sustained a GDP growth of 3.7% in 2023, underpinned 
by its resilient domestic demand. 
The domestic economy do face some challenges. Amid 
this increasingly complex operating environment, the 
Public Bank Group continued to embrace growth by 
strengthening its core competency in the retail banking 
segment and further leveraging on its strong fundamentals 
to enhance its resilience against these challenges. The 
Group also took tangible steps in its sustainability journey 
to drive greater stakeholder value. Above all, the Group 
has remained committed to its purpose as a people-
focused bank. 
A RESILIENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Sound governance, together with proactive and prudent 
management, have always been the hallmarks of the 
Public Bank Group. These values have continued to 
contribute to the Group’s financial stability throughout the 
years.

achieved higher net profit attributable to shareholders, 
which grew by 8.7% to RM6.65 billion. With that, the

front, the Group achieved a commendable growth rate of 
6.4% in residential properties financing and 10.8% in 
vehicle hire purchase financing, with leading market share 
of 20.4% and 30.5% respectively. 
The Public Bank Group has also been supportive of the 
small and medium enterprises (“SMEs”) that serve as the 
nation’s engine of growth. In 2023, the Group achieved 
a domestic SME market share of 17.9% with total 
financing of RM67.9 billion as at the end of 2023.

Apart from fulfilling customers’ banking needs, the Public Bank Group is also 
embedding community needs into its people first strategy. 
A PEOPLE FIRST STRATEGY
Underpinning its people-focused strategy, the Public Bank Group emphasises inclusiveness on financial accessibility. Leading to that, the 
Group has continued to adopt an omni-channel strategy, where banking services and face-to-face interaction are available at various touch 
points, be it physical branches or online platforms. 
In addition to the 293 domestic branches strategically located across the country to serve the people, the Public Bank Group has 
continued to enhance its digital delivery channels, enriching customers’ experience further. 
Over the years, with its online banking platforms continuing to improve with more seamless and convenient banking services, the Public 
Bank Group had registered commendable growth in users of its online channels. Over the past five years, active users for the PBe internet 
banking had increased by about 46%, while PB enterprise and PB engage mobile platforms had grown by more than two fold respectively. 
Given its proactive initiatives in promoting electronic payment, the Public Bank Group continued to be recognised by The Malaysian 
e-Payments Excellence Awards 2023 organised by PayNet, with the Bank being awarded the Special Recognition Award for Outstanding 
Contribution to Cross Border Payments.
Meanwhile, as banking technology continues to evolve, the Public Bank Group has been very vigilant to fraud risk. The Group takes a 
balanced approach in driving digital transformation and ensuring cyber resilience to protect its customer interests.   
To enhance scam prevention effectiveness, the Public Bank Group has rolled out various measures, amongst others, the PB SecureSign 
for transaction authentication, the kill switch function that enables customer to deactivate their online accounts, as well as cooling-off period 
for abnormal transactions. The Group has always ensured its initiatives are in line with industry best practices as guided by Bank Negara 
Malaysia to enhance the effectiveness of collective efforts in safeguarding customer interests. 
With these stringent measures in place, the Group has blacklisted about 151,000 mule accounts as of December 2023, which has 
protected 876,000 customers from being scammed and prevented RM1.4 billion from fraudulently transferred into scammers’ accounts. 
Apart from fulfilling customers’ banking needs, the Public Bank Group is also embedding community needs into its people first strategy. 
As part of its sustainability roadmap, the Public Bank Group aims to spend RM10 million on communities by 2030. Driving towards this 
target, the Group had in 2023 became the first bank in Malaysia to embark on the Eco-Schools programme in collaboration with Green 
Growth Asia Foundation. Pioneering climate education initiatives in schools, the Group has committed RM1.2 million for the programme 
which spans from 2023 to 2025. 
The Public Bank Group has also been actively involved in capacity building programmes to raise the awareness of the public on sustainable 
development. During the year, the Group had organised seminars themed “Embracing Sustainable Development: The Way Forward for SME 
Developers”, inviting subject matter expertise to share knowledge and guidance with the SMEs while nurturing them towards embracing 
sustainability best practices. 
In 2023, the Public Bank Group’s proactive initiatives contributing to sustainable development had been recognised by reputable 
publications such as FinanceAsia and Corporate Governance Asia which had awarded to the Group the Best ESG Impact and Best 
Sustainable Bank in Malaysia as well as Asia’s Best CSR.

A PEOPLE CENTRIC ORGANISATION 
Amid a dynamic business environment, the Public Bank Group 
continues to future proof its employees by ensuring they remain 
relevant and capable in the new business landscape, while taking 
care of their well being.
The Group has always encouraged its staff to accelerate their 
personal development. A key initiative that the Group has launched 
in 2023 was the Talent Development System and Learning 
Exchange Platform, which provide the staff with opportunities to 
realise their career aspiration while widening the Group’s talent 
development pipeline. 
These avenues encourage the staff to explore job opportunities 
within the Public Bank Group. The platforms also set out the 
required skillsets and courses to facilitate staff to acquire the job 
skills for the roles ahead.
GROUP’S PROSPECTS
Looking forward to 2024, the global environment remains uncertain 
given the persistent headwinds in the global economy and political 
landscape. Whilst Malaysia as an open economy is likely to 
continue to be affected by these challenges, the economy is 
expected to remain relatively stable with the support of domestic 
demand. 
At the Public Bank Group, the people centric practice has been the 
bedrock of the Group’s corporate culture since its founding by our 
late Chairman Emeritus, Tan Sri Dato’ Sri Dr. Teh Hong Piow.
While continuing the tradition of excellence, the Public Bank Group 
will continue to stand by its founding philosophy of being a ‘Bank 
for the People’ and to proactively seek for value-creating growth 
opportunities. The Group will also stay vigilant amid the uncertain 
global environment, ensuring sustainable value generation for its 
stakeholders in the years to come.

Amid an environment marked by rising global uncertainties, the Public Bank Group recorded a profit before tax of RM8,538.8 million in 
2023. Net profit attributable to equity holders rose by 8.7% or RM529.8 million in 2023 with the absence of one-off prosperity tax charge. 
The decline in profit before tax was mainly attributable to the lower net interest income and net income from Islamic banking business as 
a result of margin compression, partially offset by lower allowance for impairment on loans, advances and financing as adequate 
pre-emptive allowance has been made in prior years.
NET INTEREST INCOME
Net interest income, which stood at RM9,055.3 million, accounted for 69.2% of the Public Bank Group’s total income in 2023. 
Net interest income decreased by 1.2% or RM111.6 million to RM9,055.3 million in 2023 as a result of margin compression arising from 
persistent competitive pressures on deposit-taking and lending business as well as higher Statutory Reserve Requirement (“SRR”) cost 
due to the expiry of Bank Negara Malaysia’s (“BNM”) indulgence on 31 December 2022. 
As a result, net interest margin moderated to 2.20% in 2023 from 2.39% in 2022. 
NET INCOME FROM ISLAMIC BANKING BUSINESS
Net income from Islamic banking business, which represented 11.9% of the Public Bank Group’s total net income in 2023, decreased by 
15.9% or RM295.6 million to RM1,561.5 million in 2023 mainly due to lower net financing income as a result of margin compression amid 
high cost of deposits and higher SRR cost due to the expiry of BNM’s indulgence on 31 December 2022.

SUMMARY OF GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

---- Page 51 ----
The total allowance for impairment on loans, advances and financing decreased by 57.1% or RM208.9 million to RM156.7 million in 2023  
as adequate pre-emptive provisioning had already been made in previous years coupled with stable asset quality observed in the current 
year. As a result, credit charge ratio dropped to 4 basis points (“bps”) in 2023 from 10 bps in 2022.
The decrease in expected credit loss (“ECL”) of RM241.1 million was mainly due to the following:
Stage 1:
  Writeback of ECL in 2023 was mainly due to loans, advances and financing that were repaid or remeasurement of ECL due
 
to improvement in credit quality, recalibration of forward looking macroeconomic variables and derecognition of loans, advances 
and financing due to full settlement.
Stage 2:
  Higher ECL in 2023 was mainly due to loans, advances and financing that migrated to Stage 2 from Stage 1 as a result of
 
normalisation of migration between stages post COVID-19.
Stage 3: 
 Higher ECL in 2023 was mainly due to higher credit-impaired loans, advances and financing arising from normalisation of
 
impaired loans formation post COVID-19.
In 2020, the Group’s ECL had increased significantly to RM1,106.3 million due to pre-emptive provisioning set aside for potential credit 
risk losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. This further increased to RM1,201.2 million in 2021 due to additional COVID-19 related 
management overlay provisions and forward looking macroeconomic variables. The Group’s ECL decreased to RM365.6 million in 2022 
and further dropped to RM156.7 million in 2023 as adequate pre-emptive provisioning has been provided in prior years coupled with 
stable repayment and delinquency trend observed upon expiry of the various repayment assistance programmes.
As at the end of 2023, the Group’s gross impaired loans ratio stood at 0.59%. The Group’s loan loss coverage ratio remained above 
pre-pandemic level despite dropping to 181.8% as at the end of 2023, from 272.0% a year ago mainly due to higher gross impaired 
loans. Including the Group’s regulatory reserves, the loan loss coverage ratio was higher at 212.8%.

•
 Investment banking operations’ pre-tax profit decreased by 17.8% or RM9.3 million to RM42.8 million in 2023 mainly due to

• Since the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Group’s gross impaired loans ratio has reduced to 0.36% and subsequently  
to 0.31% as at the end of 2021 due to financial and monetary relief measures supported by both the Government and Bank Negara 
Malaysia as well as various flexible loan repayment assistance packages. Given the expiry of the PEMULIH repayment assistance 
programme and progressive economic recovery in 2022, the Group’s gross impaired loans ratio has gradually normalised with gross 
impaired loans ratio increasing to 0.42% as at the end of 2022 and further rose to 0.59% as at the end of 2023.
•
 The Public Bank Group’s domestic asset quality continues to rank No.1 amongst key domestic banking groups with the lowest gross
 
impaired loans ratio of 0.40% as at the end of 2023, well below the banking industry’s gross impaired loans ratio of 1.65%.
•
 The resilient and stable asset quality is a reflection of the Group’s prudent approach in loans approval coupled with its stron
g credit 
risk management practices and effective recovery processes.

• The Public Bank Group continued to maintain high levels of provisioning and regulatory reserves as reflected by the Group’s hig h loan 
loss coverage.
•
 The Group’s loan loss coverage ratio stood at 181.8% as at the end of 2023, which was higher than pre-pandemic level and remain
ed 
significantly higher compared to the banking industry’s loan loss coverage ratio of 92.0%. This is notwithstanding that more than 90% 
of the Group’s impaired loans are secured.
•
 With the inclusion of regulatory reserves, the Group’s loan loss coverage would be higher at 212.8% as at the end of 2023. The
 
Group’s resilient credit profile and prudent provisioning will help to cushion any potential pressure on the Group’s asset quality.
•
 Since 2020, the Group’s credit charge ratio has increased significantly due to prudent pre-emptive provisioning set aside for p
otential 
credit losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. This is reflected in the credit charge ratio which increased from 0.05% in 2019 to 0.33% 
in 2020 and 0.34% in 2021. The credit charge ratio of the Group fell to 0.10% and 0.04% in 2022 and 2023 respectively as adequate 
pre-emptive provisioning has been made in prior years coupled with stable repayment and delinquency trend observed upon expiry of 
the various repayment assistance programmes.

CAPITAL INITIATIVES
The key capital management initiatives that were undertaken by the Public Bank Group during the year are as follows:
(i)
 Debt 
Capital
 As 
at the end of 2023, the Public Bank Group has a total of RM6.00 billion Basel III compliant Subordinated notes/Sukuk Murabahah.
(ii)
 Healthy 
Dividend Payout
 I
n view of the Public Bank Group’s favourable performance, the Board of Directors has declared a second interim dividend of  
10.0 sen per share. Together with the first interim dividend of 9.0 sen, the total dividend for 2023 amounted to 19.0 sen per share. 
This represents a total payout of RM3.69 billion or 55.5% of the Public Bank Group’s net profit for 2023. The 19.0 sen dividend per 
share also translates to a dividend yield of 4.4% based on the share price of RM4.29 per Public Bank share as at the end of 2023.
(iii)
 Value 
Creation and Superior Returns to Shareholders
 The Public Bank Group remains committed to pay consistent and sustainable dividends to its shareholders over the long term by
 
balancing growth with proactive capital management.
 *  For comparative purpose, the dividend had been adjusted to reflect the bonus issue of 4 bonus shares for every 1 existing ordin ary share which was 
completed on 29 January 2021
 The Public Bank Group continues to deliver superior returns to its shareholders over the long term.
 If a shareholder of Public Bank bought 1,000 shares in 1967 when Public Bank was listed, and assuming that the shareholder
 
subscribed to all rights issues and did not sell any of the shares, he would have accumulated 744,690 shares worth RM3.2 million 
based on Public Bank’s share price of RM4.29 as at the end of 2023. In addition, he would have received a total gross dividend 
of RM1.9 million whilst having only invested a capital outlay of RM235,612, including subscription for all rights issues. Total dividends 
received and appreciation in share value translate to a remarkable compounded annual rate of return of 17.7% for each of the 56 
years that this shareholder has held the share in Public Bank since it was listed in 1967.

RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY FINANCING
In 2023, favourable Government policies for first time homebuyers such as 100% stamp duty exemption for residential properties of up 
to RM500,000 as well as increase in stamp duty exemption to 75% from 50% for residential properties priced between RM500,000 to  
RM1 million led to an increase in buying interest. In addition, the favourable economic landscape boosted consumer confidence. These 
were positive for the overall property sector.
The Public Bank Group continued to focus in the mass market segment which is the financing of residential properties priced between 
RM100,000 and RM500,000. In 2023, residential properties priced between RM100,000 and RM500,000 accounted for 52.8% of the

BANCASSURANCE
The Public Bank Group’s bancassurance business, which leverages on its bancassurance partnership with AIA, continued to be one of 
the Group’s main fee income generator. The Group’s domestic bancassurance business is fully supported by approximately 564 licensed 
financial executives and more than 2,000 credit related staff located across the Group’s domestic branches.
In conjunction with the launch of Project Phoenix, a joint initiative between Public Bank and AIA at all Red Carpet Banking (“RCB”) centres 
in 2023, a new single premium product, namely PB Signature Legacy, was introduced exclusively for RCB customers. During the 
implementation of Project Phoenix, Sales Opportunity Action Result 360 (“SOAR360”), an application developed on iPad for financial 
executives to support remote sales, and Customer Relationship Management Application (“CRMA”) have also been enhanced. Marketing 
leads will now flow seamlessly through SOAR360 and CRMA to enable more accurate and holistic view of RCB customer’s journey for 
effective engagement and performance monitoring.

Performance Review for 2023
•  In 2023, PFHL’s profit before tax declined by 90.0% to HKD40.6 million. The drop in profitability was due  
to higher allowance for impairment on loans, advances and financing and lower net interest income arising 
from the escalation of funding cost consequential to the United States of America (“US”) Federal Reserve 
rate hikes. The higher allowance for impairment on loans, advances and financing was mainly due to one 
large commercial borrower and some hire purchase loans amid the devaluation of commercial property 
prices and public vehicle licence value. 
•
  Amid weak loans demand, the gross loans, advances and financing of PFHL dropped by 2.4% to HKD24.29
 
billion as at the end of 2023. PFHL’s total customer deposits also declined by 3.0% to HKD29.54 billion.
•
  The gross impaired loans ratio of PFHL increased to 3.83% mainly due to credit deterioration of collateralised
 
lending for one large commercial borrower. Excluding this impaired loan, PFHL’s asset quality remained well 
managed in 2023. PFHL continued to be prudent in its underwriting standards to ensure healthy level of impaired 
loans and took prompt actions to pursue loans recovery.

The Public Bank Group remains committed to strengthen its regional presence in Indochina through synergistic growth, focusing on 
targeted customer segments and scalable business opportunities to create value.
HONG KONG
The Public Bank Group’s business operations in Hong Kong are carried out by Public Financial Holdings Limited (“PFHL”), a company 
listed on the Stock Exchange in Hong Kong since 1991 with two major subsidiaries, namely Public Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (“PBHK”) 
and Public Finance Limited (“PFL”). PBHK concentrates mainly on retail and commercial banking, stock broking and wealth management 
services, while PFL focuses on consumer financing and deposit taking businesses.
The economy of Hong Kong improved in 2023, on the back of higher consumer spending and revival of inbound tourism. Nevertheless, 
the general business environment remained challenging amid intensified geopolitics, tighter monetary policy and weak investment sentiment 
coupled with unfavourable property market.

---- Page 113 ----
The Public Bank Group’s Hong Kong operations implemented business rationalisation to achieve cost synergy by integrating the 
stockbroking and securities businesses operated by Public Bank (Hong Kong) and one of the stockbroking subsidiaries in the fourth quarter 
of 2023. The Group will continue to further improve its operational efficiency via optimisation of resources, streamline support services 
across entities and make use of synergies from the combined branch network of PBHK and PFL to achieve cost synergy within the 
Group’s Hong Kong operations.
PBHK’s strategic bancassurance partnership with AIA International Limited (Hong Kong) generated total annualised new premium of 
HKD16.9 million in 2023, an increase by 6.3% over the previous year. PBHK will continue to tap on its bancassurance business and 
leverage on the launching of ‘Global Power Multi-Currency Plan 3’ in January 2024 to improve its fee-based income.
CAMBODIA
The Public Bank Group’s operations in Cambodia are driven by:
i.
 Cambodian Public Bank Plc (“Campu Bank”);
ii.
 Campu Securities Plc (“Campu Securities”); and
iii.
 Campu Lonpac Insurance Plc (“CLIP”).
Campu Bank, established in 1992, spearheads the Public Bank Group’s retail and commercial banking business in Cambodia. Campu 
Bank is one of the largest banks in Cambodia in terms of asset size and is among the market leaders in terms of deposits, loans
 and 
profitability. Campu Securities, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campu Bank, was established in 2010 and offers securities underwriting 
and trading activities. CLIP is 55% owned by the Group and provides general insurance services in Cambodia.
In 2023, Cambodia’s GDP grew by 5.6%, propelled by continued improvement in the service sector, foreign direct investments as well 
as recovery in tourism and hospitality sector.
Performance Review for 2023
Cambodian Public Bank Plc
•  On the back of the buoyant economy, Campu Bank’s profit before  
tax increased by 9.9% to USD74.0 million in 2023, supported by 
double digit loans growth of 10.4% to USD1,403.6 million. The asset 
quality of Campu Bank remained sound with gross impaired loans 
ratio of 1.52%. In terms of deposits taking, Campu Bank continued 
to face stiff competition amid the tight liquidity market in Cambodia. 
Consequently, Campu Bank’s customer deposits dropped by 9.7% 
to USD1,337.4 million. However, Campu Bank continued to operate 
on a healthy loan to fund and equity ratio of 66.0%.
•
  Under 
an exclusive bancassurance partnership with AIA (Cambodia), 
Campu Bank captured a total annualised new premium of  
USD0.9 million in 2023. Campu Bank will continue to roll out new 
bancassurance products to cater to its diverse customer segments.
• 
 In order to have a wider reach for the underserved market,
 
Campu Bank has expanded its branch network to 32 with the 
opening of a new branch at Russey Keo in June 2023.
•
  CLIP, one of the main players in the highly competitive Cambodian
 
insurance market, remained profitable, recording a pre-tax profit of 
USD1.0 million in 2023.

•  Operating under these challenging conditions, Public Bank Vietnam 
recorded a decline in profit before tax by 8.4% to  
VND541.34 billion in 2023, attributed to higher allowance for 
impairment on loans, advances and financing, lower non-interest 
income as well as increase in operating expenses due to branch 
network expansion.
• 
 Public Bank Vietnam recorded a healthy gross loans, advances
 
and financing growth of 5.6% to VND26,302.59 billion whilst 
customer deposits grew by a commendable 15.9% to 
VND21,341.02 billion.
•
  The bancassurance partnership between Public Bank Vietnam and
 
AIA (Vietnam) generated total annualised new premium of VND3.00

LAO PDR
•  Lao PDR’s market condition was challenging throughout 2023, partly due to the weaker Lao KIP, the Laos national currency and  
heightened inflationary pressure.
• 
 Notwithstanding the difficult operating environment, the Public Bank Laos Operations’ profit before tax increased by 34.1% to
 
LAK90.67 billion in 2023 supported by improvement in gross loans, advances and financing by 15.1% to LAK1,819.50 billion. However, 
deposits decreased marginally by 3.5% to LAK1,834.98 billion due to intense competition for foreign currency deposits, especially the 
US Dollar. 
•
  In 2023, the Public Bank Group obtained regulatory approval to locally incorporate a banking subsidiary known as Public Bank La
o 
Limited (“Public Bank Lao”) to take over the existing four banking branch businesses in Lao PDR. The Bank of Lao PDR granted the 
banking licence to Public Bank Lao in November 2023 and Public Bank Lao officially commenced business operations on 1 January 
2024 as a full fledge banking subsidiary.
 
 This signifies a milestone achievement and augurs well for the Group to strengthen its presence in Lao PDR and to boost the syn
ergy 
in the Indo-China region for long term business growth and sustainability.
•
  The Public Bank Group is committed to expand its banking operations in Lao PDR leveraging on the strategically located branch
 
network of the four branches of Public Bank Lao.
SRI LANKA
•  Public Bank has three overseas branches in Sri Lanka. In line with the economic improvement in the second half of 2023 owing to  
numerous macroeconomics policies implemented by the Government, Public Bank’s Sri Lanka Operations achieved a commendable 
increase in its profit before tax to LKR938.9 million in 2023, on the back of double-digit interest rates in the market. 
•
  Deposits from customers also grew by 3.8% to LKR3,343.7 million in 2023. However, loans and advances decreased marginally by
 
3.2% to LKR5,772.6 million impacted by the subdued loans demand which was affected by the high interest rate environment and 
stagnant property market in Sri Lanka.

The Group’s Approach
With the global and national climate change agenda gaining traction, the Public Bank 
Group too has charted its approach to managing the risk and opportunities from 
climate change. Since 2022, the Group has embarked on efforts to integrate climate-
related considerations into business strategies and risk management processes guided 
by the VBIAF and in 2023, to be in line with BNM’s requirements outlined in the Policy 
Document on Climate Risk Management and Scenario Analysis.
Evolving the Group’s Climate Action Agenda
Overarching the Public Bank Group’s climate action agenda is the Group’s qualitative Climate Risk Appetite Statement, 
operationalised into the Group’s targets of achieving Carbon Neutral (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 and Net Zero Carbon by 
2050, and is in line with the Paris Agreement’s ultimate goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°C. 
The Public Bank Group has in 2023, became a signatory to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (“PCAF”), and 
accordingly adopted the PCAF methodologies and database to compute the Group’s financed emissions. Read more about the 
Group’s financed emission in  Section Reference: Carbon Emissions on page 172.
The Public Bank Group’s commitments and strategies in relation to climate change are embedded in the Climate-Related Strategy
Policy (“CRSP”). The CRSP is underpinned by three climate-related Strategic Directions (“3 SDs”):

Strengthening Efforts Towards Decarbonisation
Since 2016, the Public Bank Group has measured and disclosed its carbon emissions in the annual Sustainability Report. In 2023, 
the Group restrategised its approach towards carbon emissions management through three focus areas.
1  Expanding Data Monitoring and Reporting
 Driven by the ethos – what gets measured gets managed,
 
the Public Bank Group expanded the scope of carbon 
emissions reporting to include emissions from its banking 
branch network in Malaysia, Laos and Sri Lanka, as well as 
the Group’s subsidiaries in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Cambodia 
and Vietnam. This effort is in line with the development of a 
decarbonisation strategy for the Group to achieve Carbon 
Neutral status for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2030. 
2  Developing a Public Bank Group Decarbonisation  
Strategy
 The Public Bank Group undertook a Group-wide review of its
 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 boundaries and reporting scope to 
establish a clear understanding of its carbon emissions 
sources and determine the carbon emissions baseline. The 
year 2022 was identified as the baseline year for Scope 1 
and Scope 2. To accelerate the decarbonisation efforts, an 
external consultant was engaged to support the development 
of the decarbonisation strategy. A focused and concerted 
strategy will increase the impact of carbon and energy 
initiatives implemented across the Group. The Public Bank 
Group aims to publish the decarbonisation strategy in the 
near term. 
 To ensure reliability, the Public Bank Group, in 2023,
 
obtained its first external assurance on Scope 1 and Scope 2  
emissions data for 2022 and 2023. Please refer to Limited 
Assurance Report on page 273.
3  Setting the Foundations for Scope 3 Financed Emissions
 Acknowledging 
that financed emissions constitutes the 
largest source of emissions for the Public Bank Group, the 
Group has begun to measure its financed emissions. As a 
PCAF Signatory, the Group referred to the PCAF Standards 
in measuring its estimated financed emissions for the first 
time. The Group’s estimated financed emissions cover 
approximately 86% of the Group’s total domestic loans, 
advances and financing since 2021 in five asset classes – 
motor vehicles, mortgage, commercial real estate, business 
loan and project finance.
 The estimated financed emissions allow the Public Bank
 
Group to set the foundation for development of the Group’s 
Net Zero Carbon strategy. The estimated financed emissions 
enable the Group to identify the emissions hotspots across 
its financing portfolio as well as the drivers and opportunities 
for climate transition including partnerships with customers. 
While the Group recognises that there are limitations to the 
estimated financed emissions, the Group endeavours to 
improve the data quality and accuracy of the financed 
emissions over time. The Group expects the emissions value 
to change alongside improvement in data quality.
The Group’s Approach
The Public Bank Group is committed to reducing its direct and indirect carbon 
emissions. The Group consistently measures and discloses its carbon emissions to 
track progress towards its climate targets of achieving Carbon Neutral (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2) by 2030 and Net Zero Carbon by 2050. The Group endeavours to bolster 
its approach to carbon emissions management initiatives to reduce its carbon 
footprint.
 Key Highlights

Public Bank Berhad  |  2023 Integrated Annual Report
The Public Bank Group continues to focus efforts on reducing 
energy consumption through various operational initiatives.
Improving Energy Efficiency
During the year, various energy efficiency initiatives were implemented 
for the Group’s buildings. Photoelectric sensors and motion sensors 
were installed in two main buildings, Menara Public Bank and Public 
Bank Tower in all the common areas. At Public Mutual’s Head 
Office, half of the lights are switched off during lunchtime to 
minimise wastage. Additional energy efficient features are being 
studied and leveraged to further reduce energy use.
Generating Renewable Energy 
Menara Public Bank 2, the Public Bank Group’s first LEED Gold certified property, houses  a solar panel system covering 400 m 2 on 
the roof. In 2023, three solar panel projects were completed in Malaysia. One of the main buildings, Bangunan Public Bank, was 
installed with solar panels with generation capacity of 58 kWp. Solar panels were installed at two domestic branches with generation 
capacity of 53 kWp and 54 kWp respectively. With the completion of these projects, the total renewable energy production increased 
from 48 MWh in 2022 to 100 MWh in 2023. The Group will continue to explore the feasibility of installing additional solar panels across 
its properties to increase its renewable energy generation capacity.
Purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates
To boost the energy efficiency efforts, Renewable Energy Certificates (“RECs”) were purchased. In 2023, a total of 650 MWh were 
purchased under Tenaga Nasional Berhad’s Green Electricity Tariff Program, to compensate for 50% of the annual grid electricity 
consumption of Public Bank Tower.
Water
The Public Bank Group recognises that water is a key resource 
and encourages responsible water use to conserve water across 
the Group’s operations. Driven by its water reduction target, the 
Group consistently monitors its water consumption, sourced from 
the local municipal water supply.
The Public Bank Group is focused on reducing its water footprint 
through physical asset enhancement by installing water efficient 
fittings. In 2023, the Group expanded its water consumption data 
coverage group-wide to better monitor its water footprint. The annual 
water consumption for the Public Bank Group was 479,193 m3, an 
increase of 4.0% compared to 2022, mainly attributed by employees 
returning to work in the office.

Waste Management and Paper Consumption
The Public Bank Group strives to manage its waste responsibly and reduce its waste sent to landfill. The Group’s approach 
towards waste management centres upon the concept of 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. The Group is looking at new ways 
of working and education as integral means to minimise waste generation.
Waste Management
The Public Bank Group has taken the necessary precautions to 
comply with local authorities on managing waste responsibly and 
efficiently without overburdening the environment.
To manage solid waste and electronic waste, the Public Bank 
Group appoints vendors licensed by the Department of Environment 
(“DOE”). The Group has also set strict disposal policies for 
sensitive documents to ensure the documents are properly 
disposed of and recycled.
For the first time, waste data is monitored across the Public Bank 
Group. In 2023, the Group generated an estimated 1,578 tonnes 
of waste and recycled about 602 tonnes of waste including items 
such as paper, plastics and cardboard.
As part of the Public Bank Group’s recycling initiative, the Group 
started to issue the Visa Signature credit cards, made from 
sustainable materials and introduced green points to encourage 
card members to spend on recognised green products with 
selected merchants.
Paper Consumption
In 2023, the Public Bank Group’s paper consumption amounted 
to 1,112,447 kg of paper 1, utilised in its day-to-day operations. To 
minimise impact from its use of paper, the Group purchases 
Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”) 
certified paper to ensure that the paper comes from sustainably 
managed forests. Employees are encouraged to minimise printing 
and recycle paper. Various digitalisation efforts have also been 
implemented to reduce the use of paper in the daily operations.

As part of its efforts to support the local economy, the Public Bank Group sources from local suppliers and vendors. This is reflected 
through the Group’s supplier profile whereby over 98% of the total suppliers are local suppliers.
Aligning Public Bank’s Expectations Across the Supply Chain
The Public Bank Group has put in place the ESG requirements of its suppliers and vendors through the Public Bank Group Vendor Code 
of Conduct (“Vendor CoC”). The Vendor CoC sets out the principles and expectations of its suppliers and vendors to conduct their 
businesses in line with the Group’s corporate objectives of upholding good corporate governance and building a sustainable, ethical, 
strong, respectable and profitable business.
The Vendor CoC applies to all of the Public Bank Group’s third-party suppliers, vendors, consultants and contractors. In 2023, the Group 
reviewed and enhanced its Vendor CoC, setting higher ESG expectations required of its suppliers and vendors. The key enhancements 
are focused on environmental-related practices such as resource management, carbon emissions management and climate resilience.

Driving the ESG Agenda through Vendor Engagement
In addition to the vendor due diligence conducted on existing and potential suppliers and 
vendors, the Public Bank Group has embedded ESG criteria into its supplier screening 
process to encourage sustainable practices among its suppliers and vendors. If necessary, 
the Group conducts on-site audits to ensure the suppliers and vendors’ practices are aligned 
with the Group’s ESG commitments.
To promote greener procurement practices, the Public Bank Group actively encourages its 
suppliers and vendors to participate in its electronic purchase orders. The Group will continue 
to identify and explore areas for improvement to create better ESG practices in its supply 
chain.
Building Climate Resilience
To effectively respond to financial risks and disruptions to supply chains due to climate change, the Public Bank Group ensures 
that vendors of critical services are aware and manage their climate-related risks to prevent disruption to the 
provision of the Group’s products and services. The Group also practises multi vendors system to avoid over reliance on a single

In preparing the Public Bank Group’s workforce for the future by developing the required skills, some key initiatives implemented in 2023 
include:
•
 Skill Gap Assessment (“SGA”)

to the relevant trainings. To-date, over 3,900 employees participated in the SGA for Frontline Operations and Islamic Banking.
•
 Digital Upskilling Programme
 – With rapid digitalisation shaping the future of banking, this digital upskilling programme offers digital-
essential curriculum which focuses on promoting baseline digital proficiency, developing higher level digital skills for non-information 
technology users and strengthening digital awareness in critical digital-related areas.
•
 Managerial Skill Programme
 – In supporting managerial roles to develop strong leadership qualities and become successful people 
managers, identified candidates are enrolled into an online learning programme in partnership with Harvard ManageMentor. The 
platform provides comprehensive leadership webinar courses facilitated by world-class moderators from Harvard to build fundamental 
leadership knowledge and skills.
•
 Sustainability Capacity Building
 – In view of the increasing expectations of stakeholders and regulatory requirements in the banking 
industry, sustainability-related trainings are made available across the business from new hires up to the Board of Directors. The Group 
regularly enrols candidates in credible sustainability-related certified courses throughout the year.
Learning Exchange Platform
As part of the talent retention strategy and to support internal employees to build holistic skillsets within the Public Bank Group, 
‘My PB Aspiration’ was established as a platform to enable and facilitate internal job mobility. Interested candidates are encouraged

Group to attract and retain its talent pool amidst high demands for talent across the industry. To this end, the Group focused on 
differentiating itself against its competitors to attract the right talent. Initiatives include:
•
 Campus Engagement
 – The key objective of this initiative is to strengthen the Group’s brand name among the youths through a 
series of campus activities. In 2023, the Group held various activities including 49 careers fairs and 19 career engagement talks.
•

time employees.

 – This programme provides annual working contracts to retired employees who wish to return to the 
workforce and continue to share their knowledge and experience with their younger peers. The Group re-employed 70 retired 
employees in 2023 to leverage on their skills and experiences for a special project.
Driving Performance of Employees
To motivate employees in driving the Public Bank Group’s long-term sustainable goals, employees are rewarded through financial and 
non-financial means. The amount and type of compensation awarded will be commensurate with each employee’s performance, measured 
based on specific Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) determined annually.
The Public Bank Group has integrated ESG KPIs into the performance assessment of the C-suite and Senior Management 
to demonstrate the importance of leadership roles in driving the sustainability agenda.
Following the introduction of Quantitative ESG KPIs for Head of Divisions (“HoDs”) in 2022, the KPIs are now extended to the 
C-suite and Senior Management of Public Bank, as well as Chief Executive Officer, General Manager and HoDs of Public 
Islamic Bank.
Quantitative ESG KPIs in relation to ‘ESG-friendly Economic Activities/Green Activities’ continue to be incorporated within the 
score cards of Regional Managers and Branch Management Personnel (including Hire Purchase (“HP”) Centres and HP Hubs)

Planning for Future Leaders
The Public Bank Group has a structured and dynamic succession planning culture which covers multi-pronged talent identification and 
development approaches where all key leadership positions are ready with identified potential successors.
Customised leadership development programmes have been created under three main categories:
Listening to the Employees
Employee engagement is pivotal in understanding employee satisfaction and fostering positive work sentiment towards the Public Bank 
Group. Employee engagement also enables the Management to gain insights of potential areas of improvement across the business. This 
year, the Malaysian operations conducted its inaugural Workplace Pulse Survey (“WPS”). The survey received an overwhelming response 
rate of 74%, signalling a positive reception towards the survey. The outcome of the survey will be used to drive employee-focused 
initiatives with the aim of improving workplace culture and environment.
Awards and Recognition
In 2023, the Public Bank Group’s talent branding efforts were recognised with various awards. Public Bank was awarded the ‘Top 3 Best 
Employer in the Banking sector’ for the sixth consecutive year and ‘Top 1% among Graduates Preferred Employer (Graduates’ Top 25 
Preferred Employers in Malaysia)’ for the third consecutive year in the 2023 Graduates’ Choice Award. In the same regard, Public 
Investment Bank won the ‘Fourth Most Preferred Employer in Investment Banking’ whilst Public Islamic Bank was awarded the ‘Sixth Most 
Preferred Employer in Islamic Banking’ in the 2023 Graduates’ Choice Award. Meanwhile, Public Mutual was awarded ‘Premium Employer 
Partner’ for the fourth consecutive year by the Chartered Financial Analyst (“CFA”) Society Malaysia.
The Public Bank Group continues to provide opportunities for career progression for existing employees. In 2023, 2,054 employees were 
assessed and included in the Group’s talent pool, whilst 1,879 employees were promoted to take on greater responsibilities. As a result, 
the Group maintained a low attrition rate of 9.5% in 2023.
The SEED (“Support, Engage, Empower and Develop”) programme is developed to assist new Management Trainees in maximising 
their potential in the Public Bank Group. In the SEED programme, a Talent Development Partner (“TDP”) is identified and assigned 
to each trainee. The TDP acts as an advisor to the trainees to provide necessary support and guidance throughout their learning 
journey. 
The SEED program involves a two-way communication as feedback from both the TDP and the trainees to foster collaboration and 
enhance the trainees’ onboarding experience. The proactive engagement initiative has contributed to a high retention rate of 
Management Trainees of 79.3%.

The Group’s Approach
The Public Bank Group is committed to upholding and respecting human and labour 
rights. The Group respects human rights and vigilantly keeps abreast with the latest 
developments in the employment law, industrial relations law as well as the human 
rights climate in the community where the Group operates and takes human rights 
matters into its considerations across the business operations. The Group expects the 
same principles are upheld by all its employees and integrated across its value chain. 
Protecting Human and Labour Rights
In ensuring that all Public Bank Group’s employees are treated with respect and dignity, 
the Group does not tolerate any malpractices or inappropriate behaviour including 
violation of human rights, child labour or unfair labour practices. 
Employees can raise concerns relating to the workplace including discrimination and 
harassment via the existing reporting channels, such as the whistleblowing channel and 
staff grievance portal. Mechanisms are in place to manage human and labour rights 
violations, should they occur.
The Public Bank Group also recognises that its business relationships have the potential 
to cause or contribute towards negative human and labour rights impact. In this 
respect, all suppliers and vendors are expected to align with the Group’s commitments. 
The salient principles expected of them are - respect human rights principles, prohibit 
all forms of forced or child labour in its operations and at minimum, meet the applicable 
employment and labour regulations.
Recognising that policies and preventive measures may not sufficiently mitigate all the 
risk related to human and labour rights, the Public Bank Group proactively communicates 
its expectations to the relevant stakeholders through the revised DEI Policy and Public 
Bank Group Vendor Code of Conduct. As part of the Group’s commitment towards 
human and labour rights, the Group aims to publish a Human Rights Policy in the near 
term.
In 2023, there  
were zero 
incidents 
reported related 
to violation of

An Anti – Sexual Harassment Policy is in place to provide a safe work environment for all employees, free from sexual harassment 
arising out of and in the course of employment. Sexual harassment in the workplace includes any employment-related sexual 
harassment occurring outside the workplace due to employment responsibilities or employment relationships. In the event of a 
sexual harassment incident occurring in the workplace, proper investigation shall be conducted and disciplinary action shall be taken 
if the complaint is verified.

Health and Safety in the Workplace
The Occupational Safety and Health (“OSH”) Policy was developed 
published with the objective of creating a safe and healthy 
workplace. The OSH Policy is guided by the requirements and 
guidelines of the local authorities such as the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act 1994.
A Safety and Health Committee was established to assist in 
reviewing and developing safety and health standards and 
procedures at the workplace. The OSH Unit, supporting the Safety 
and Health Committee carries out inspections to identify and 
assess potential risk to the health, safety and security of the 
stakeholders at the workplace. Periodic fire and evacuation drills 
are conducted as a fire safety procedure to prepare and familiarise 
the employees with the evacuation procedure in the event of 
emergency.
The Public Bank Group continuously equips its employees with the 
necessary training and knowledge of OSH to protect its people 
and the relevant stakeholders. In 2023, 140 certified first aiders 
attended the refresher first aid training course. In addition, the 
Group continues to conduct e-learning courses on OSH-related 
matters to raise awareness among the employees.
Similarly, the same principles and expectations are required of the 
Public Bank Group’s suppliers and vendors. They are expected to 
uphold the same principles and adhere to the Group’s OSH Policy 
and requirements, especially when stationed at the Group’s 
premises.

The Group’s Approach
The Public Bank Group’s responsible lending approach is supported by its Credit 
Policy, which is a comprehensive framework encompassing lending directions, 
procedures, management of credit risks and minimum credit standards. To ensure the 
resilience of its loan portfolio, the Group practises a strict credit appraisal approach, 
underpinned by a strong centralised credit control and credit risk management 
system.
Embedding Responsible Lending Principles across the Group
The Public Bank Group has established a sound and well-defined RAC for housing 
loan/house financing, commercial retail loan/financing, retail small and medium 
enterprise (“SME”) financing and corporate loans, which is commensurate with the 
Group’s policy on sectoral concentration risk and key factors aligned with the Group’s 
business strategy.
To this end, employees play a critical role in operationalising the principles. Periodic 
training is conducted to ensure employees are competent in making responsible credit 
judgements amid the rapidly changing regulatory requirements and credit management 
environment. On average, more than 9,000 employees were trained annually since 
2021. 
The Public Bank Group’s responsible lending practices have resulted in low impaired loans ratio across its major business segments.
Note:  Indu stry’s figures for 2021 onwards were based on the new set loan/
financing data reflecting the latest requirements.

Customer Feedback Surveys
The Public Bank Group continues to measure customer satisfaction to gauge whether its services are meeting the needs and expectations 
of customers. The majority of banking transactions have been migrated to the e-platform and self-service machines with only complex 
transactions being transacted over the counter, such as large cash deposits with various denominations, fixed deposits and remittance. 
As a result, the rate of conformance to the customer waiting time has been declining in the last three years with the shift in customer 
behaviour. This has affected the conformance rate of the 2 minutes Standard Waiting Time.

Industry Participation and Collaboration
The Joint Committee on Climate Change (“JC3”) is a joint regulator industry platform co-chaired by BNM and Securities Commission 
Malaysia which aims to actively look into resolving the collective climate change challenges faced by the financial sector. To date, the 
Public Bank Group is a member of the JC3 Sub-Committee 1: Risk Management (“JC3 SC1”) and JC3 SME Focus Group as well as 
the various JC3-related working groups. The Group’s participation enabled the Group to gain valuable insights, provide feedback and join 
in the formulation of the industry best practices and methodologies to address climate change concerns. These are also platforms for the 
financial institutions to discuss the challenges faced by the borrowers and formulate collective actions to overcome the challenges.
Sustainable Finance Framework and Sustainable Products and Services Guideline
Amid the proliferation of sustainable finance and investments, the need for harmonised definitions has grown. Clear definitions of green 
activities are crucial to guide relationship managers, product developers and risk managers on eligible financing and product offerings. 
The Public Bank Group’s financing activities are guided by the Sustainable Finance Framework (“SFF”). Established in 2023, the SFF 
outlines the methodology and procedures for classification of loans/financing products as “green”, as well as the overarching framework 
on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) risk management process. Supporting the SSF is the Sustainable Products and Services 
Guideline (“SPSG”) which outlines the eligible economic activities and criteria for green financing.
The SFF and SPSG facilitate the identification of green financing opportunities to drive innovation on products and to address financing 
needs of customers to pursue a more green business model. Coupled with the ESG due diligence process, the identification of ESG risk 
in the borrowers’ profile also provides an avenue for the Public Bank Group to engage with borrowers to assist them in their transition 
journey towards more sustainable practices.
Moving forward, the SFF and SPSG are key enablers to pursue green financing and to mitigate the risk of greenwashing, as the Public 
Bank Group builds its efforts towards a low carbon economy.

Reducing Operational and Financed Footprint 
In line with the target to achieve Carbon Neutral by 2030 for Scope 1 and Scope 2, and Net Zero Carbon by 2050, the Public Bank 
Group has charted its commitment to progressively reduce the Group’s emissions by 2030 and 2050.

The Public Bank Group undertook a Group-wide review of its Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 boundaries, and reporting scope to have 
a clear understanding of its carbon emissions sources and to determine the carbon emissions baseline. The Group has also begun to 
measure additional Scope 3 emissions namely financed emissions. Having clarity enables a strategic approach to achieving impactful 
reductions in emissions.

---- Page 232 ----
With the aim to publish the Public Bank Group’s Decarbonisation Strategy in the near term, priority is placed on Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
from the Group’s main buildings and branches. The Group intends to improve energy efficiency within its operations and increase the use 
of renewable energy to significantly reduce the emissions. Since 2017, the Group has deployed various energy related programmes such 
as lighting replacement with LEDs and installation of solar panels at the Group’s properties. The Decarbonisation Strategy will accelerate 
the Group’s approach to reduce the carbon emissions by 2030.  
In 2023, the Public Bank Group reduced the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 carbon emissions by 2,684 tCO 2e from 2022 emissions 
primarily through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates and use of solar energy.
To achieve the Net Zero Carbon by 2050 target means managing the Public Bank Group’s Scope 3 emissions, the largest source of 
carbon emissions. Currently, the Group measures and discloses Scope 3 emissions from business travel and employee commute. To 
measure the Group’s financed emissions, Public Bank became a signatory to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (“PCAF”), 
a global carbon accounting standard to assess emissions from financing and investments. Following this, the Group had measured the 
Scope 3 financed emissions of five financing asset classes; motor vehicles, mortgages, commercial real estate, business loan and project 
finance. The PCAF estimated Scope 3 financed emissions is approximately 6 million tCO2e in 2023, covering 86% of the Group’s domestic 
financing portfolio. 
The Public Bank Group will continue to track and disclose its Scope 3 emissions from its operations. Recognising that there are limitations 
to data and evolution of external factors, the Group will regularly assess the reliability and accuracy of its disclosures to better reflect the 
Group’s impact and progress. 
The following table summarises the key carbon emissions related initiatives executed in 2023:

Identification and Assessment of Climate-Related Risk
In 2023, the Public Bank Group continued with its efforts to integrate climate-related risk management into its Enterprise Risk Management.  
The insights from the JC3 forums are key enablers to review and to enhance the Group’s climate-related risk processes ensuring the risk 
management process is fit-for-purpose and effective in managing climate-related risks. The Group’s climate-related risk management 
initiatives are planned out in the Climate Risk Management and Scenario Analysis Board-Approved Implementation Plan (“CRMSA BAIP”) 
submitted to BNM in May 2023. The CRMSA BAIP serves as the Group’s guiding internal document, outlining specific actions to

Integration and Management of Climate-Related Risk
To manage the climate change physical and transition risks impacting both the customers and the Public Bank Group, the Group has 
progressively implemented policies, tools and risk management processes to execute actions to promote and support business borrowers 
in their transition to more sustainable and climate-resilient practices.
Transition Risk
The diagram below is an overview of the Public Bank Group’s risk management on managing borrowers’ transition risk.
Scope of ESG Due Diligence
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations are embedded in the credit on-boarding process, annual credit review and 
extension of additional financing to existing borrowers by subjecting borrowers to an ESG Due Diligence (“ESG DD”) process. During the 
year, the ESG DD requirement was expanded from covering only public listed companies and their subsidiaries to all large corporate 
borrowers under the corporate financing segment (such borrowers are collectively referred to as “Large Corporates”). With this scope, as 
at the end of 2023, 39% of total domestic gross business financing would be subjected to ESG DD. In 2024, ESG DD will be applied 
to all Non-SMEs comprising both large corporates and mid-size corporates, as well as the SME borrowers from the High ESG Risk sectors 
(“HERs”). By this, 78% of total domestic gross business financing is subject to ESG DD.
Notes:

ESG Due Diligence Process
The ESG DD process assesses borrowers on environmental, social and governance factors guided by the Public Bank Group’s Policy on 
ESG Risk Acceptance Criteria (“RAC Policy”) implemented since 2021. The RAC Policy outlines the overall approach to managing ESG-
related risks, with the objective of nurturing and supporting borrowers’ transition towards sustainability by promoting borrowers’ commitment 
towards ESG. These are operationalised into a RAC Checklist, being the risk assessment tool used to execute the ESG DD. The RAC 
Checklists are identified into Sectoral and General RAC Checklists. To date, the Group has three (3) Sectoral RACs; Palm Oil, Construction 
& Infrastructure and Real Estate, and one (1) General RAC applicable to all Non-SMEs. The outcome of the ESG DD is the assignment 
of an ESG Risk Grade of “Low”, “Medium”, “High” or “Unacceptable” to reflect the borrowers’ ESG standing. For SME identified as HERs, 
it will be facilitated by a Simplified General RAC. 
As at the end of 2023, 96% of HERs large corporate borrowers had undergone ESG DD. The outcome is as follows:
HERs Borrowers’ By ESG Risk Grade
Low
•
 Borrowers with minimal or no adverse ESG impact, and actively applies best ESG management procedures and
 
practices in its own operations
85%
Medium
•
 Borrowers with some of level of ESG impact, and has put in place some ESG management procedures and
 
practices in its operations
11%
High
•
 Borrowers with significant and adverse ESG impact, and has limited management procedures and practices to
 
mitigate ESG impact
<0.01%
Unacceptable 
•
 Borrowers falls under the ESG Exclusion List with major and irreversible ESG impact, has no ESG management
 
procedures and practices in place and are not willing to improve
Nil
Execution of ESG DD is pending annual review 4%
Total 100%
From the outcome of the ESG DD, the Environmental component is an input to the Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy 
(“CCPT”) classification. The assessment of the Environmental component encapsulates the assessment of the borrowers’ financing purpose 
differentiating into climate change mitigation, adaptation or not meeting climate purpose. This is followed by the assessment on the overall 
business of the borrowers to assess whether the business is causing significant harm to environment and subsequently the assessment 
of the remedial measures to promote transition or reduce harmful practices. The outcome is the assignment of the six categories of CCPT 
classification. 
In the first quarter of 2024, the respective RAC Checklists to execute the ESG DD will be reviewed and revised to align to the CCPT 
Implementation Group’s Due Diligence Questionnaire (“DD Questionnaire”) issued on 12 January 2024. This exercise will synchronise the 
financial institutions’ ESG Due Diligence to achieve consistent CCPT assessment and classification across financial institutions. In addition, 
amongst others, borrowers will be required to measure their carbon emissions as the committed remedial actions and its progress will be 
measured against the reduction in the carbon emissions.

Lending Decision
Borrower’s business activities which fall within the Public Bank 
Group’s ESG Exclusion List are assigned with an ESG Risk Grade 
of “Unacceptable” and financing application will be rejected. For 
borrowers with a “High” ESG Risk Grade, approval is conditional 
with borrowers committing to a Time-bound Plan (“TBP”) to 
transition to sustainable business and to overtime improve their 
ESG Risk Grade. For “Medium” and “Low” ESG Risk Grade 
borrowers, the Group will monitor the existing remedial measures 
or the committed TBP to assess borrowers’ transition progress 
and to ensure no deterioration in the borrowers’ ESG Risk Grade. 
Notwithstanding the ESG Risk Grade, all borrowers are subject to 
the usual credit assessment process prior to granting financing. 
Monitoring 
With the Public Bank Group’s ESG risk infrastructure better placed 
as well as a stronger and aligned industry pledge to achieve the 
national climate target, collectively these will improve borrowers’ 
commitment to the ESG transition agenda. The Group’s expanded 
range of sustainable financing and products will support this cause. 
In 2024, the Group will move into the next phase of engaging the 
borrowers on their TBP, to track their progress and to understand 
borrowers’ pain points or challenges. This is also an opportunity for 
the Group to offer sustainable financing and products to assist 
borrowers as they navigate the sustainability landscape. To better 
manage the engagement process, the Group will equip credit 
officers with the necessary ESG management tools and internal 
guidelines to achieve standardised ESG assessment and CCPT 
classification as well as guidelines to identify suitable financing 
solutions for borrowers to transition.

Physical Risk
Since 2022, the Public Bank Group had formalised as part of the 
credit assessment process to perform a simple check of the 
properties received as collateral against information on flood-prone 
areas as obtained from the National Disaster Management Agency 
(“NADMA”) and to tag the status accordingly. 
The BNM’s Climate Risk Management and Scenario Analysis 
(“CRMSA”) Policy Document and BNM’s Climate Risk Stress Test 
(“CRST”) Methodology Paper issued on 29 February 2024 require 
the quantification of financial institutions’ exposures to climate 
change and the potential losses arising from both physical and 
transition risks. The requirements of both documents entail 
integration of external data to the borrowers’ collateral information 
and business operations as well as the application of robust 
methodologies to project the borrowers-at-risk to flood under 
various scenarios and over various time horizons. To execute such 
complex exercise, in 2023, the Public Bank Group engaged with 
external solution providers to better understand the requirements 
and to explore the use of system or a tool to map the borrowers’ 
collateral and business operations against flood-prone locations. 
This exercise will facilitate assessment of borrowers’ susceptibility 
to physical risk. Such pursuit will be intensified in 2024 to enable 
the Group to execute the Scenario Analysis and Climate Stress 
Test as part of BNM requirements expected to be submitted by 
30 June 2025. In addition, the Group will also tap on the 
discussion and sharing of information and methodologies at the 
JC3 SC1’s Physical Risk Working Group of which the Group is a 
member.
A similar process will also be applied to map the Group’s own 
buildings and key assets to assess the susceptibility of the Group’s 
exposure to flood risk. This is a forward looking view of the Group’s 
assets in addition the current flood risk assessment.

Board Responsibilities
The Board is responsible for formulating and reviewing key policies 
and charting the course of the Bank’s strategic directions. The 
Board, through the Audit Committee, Risk Management Committee, 
Compliance Committee, Credit Risk Management Committee and 
Board Sustainability Management Committee provides effective 
oversight of the Management’s performance, risk assessment and 
controls over business operations, sustainability management, and 
compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board is responsible 
for determining the nature and extent of the principal risks it is 
willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.
The key responsibilities of the Board and matters reserved for 
Board’s consideration and approval are set out in the Board 
Charter and disclosed in the Public Bank’s Corporate Governance 
Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, which  
can be downloaded from Public Bank’s corporate website at  
www.publicbankgroup.com.
The Board has delegated authority to various Board Committees 
to enable them to support the Board effectively in accordance with 
their terms of reference.
Separation of Roles of Non-Executive Chairman and 
Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer 
The Board has established the roles and responsibilities of the 
Non-Executive Chairman which are distinct and separate from the 
roles and responsibilities of the Managing Director/Chief Executive 
Officer (“CEO”). This segregation between the roles and 
responsibilities of the Non-Executive Chairman and the Managing 
Director/CEO ensures an appropriate balance of role, responsibility 
and accountability at Board level.
Roles of Chairman, Managing Director/CEO and  
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Chairman plays a pivotal role in leading  
an effective Board, serving as a guiding force for strategic  
decision-making and fostering a collaborative and constructive 
board environment. 
In providing leadership to the Board, the Non-Executive Chairman 
leads the Board in the adoption and implementation of good 
corporate governance practices in the Bank. He ensures the 
smooth functioning of the Board and inculcates positive culture in 
the Board as well as ensuring that the procedures and processes 
are in place to facilitate effective conduct of business of the Board. 
The Chairman acts as the facilitator at Board meetings to ensure 
that healthy discussions take place by fostering free expression of 
opinions of Board Members so as to arrive at optimum decisions. 
The Chairman also ensures that decisions are taken on a sound 
and well-informed basis, with all strategic and critical issues 
considered by the Board, and that Directors receive the relevant 
information on a timely basis.
The Chairman encourages open and frank deliberations by 
Directors at every Board meeting. Based on the outcome of the 
Board Effectiveness Evaluation exercise conducted by an 
independent external consultant for financial year 2023, the 
Chairman executes an effective leadership process and is regarded 
as an excellent and open facilitator to boardroom discussions.
The Managing Director/CEO assumes a critical role in effective 
management by overseeing the Bank’s day-to-day operations with 
a focus on strategic direction and organisational objectives. He is 
responsible for developing the business direction and strategies of 
the Bank and also ensures that the Bank’s business strategies and 
policies are effectively implemented.
The Non-Executive Directors review, among other things, the 
performance of Management in meeting key performance targets and 
monitor the reporting of the Group’s performance. Their role is to 
constructively challenge the Management and monitor the success of 
Management in achieving the approved targets and business plans 
within the risk appetite set by the Board. They have free and open 
contact with the Management at all levels. The Independent  
Non-Executive Directors provide independent and objective views, 
assessment 
and suggestions in deliberations of the Board.
The Directors are at liberty to seek independent professional 
advice on matters relating to the fulfilment of their roles and 
responsibilities. The cost of procuring these professional services 
will be borne by the Bank.
Pursuant to Bank Negara Malaysia (“BNM”)’s requirement, an 
Independent Non-Executive Director has been appointed as the Senior 
Independent Director to support the Board in providing focused 
oversight over the management of fraud and data breach incidents.
The roles and responsibilities of the Non-Executive Chairman, 
Managing Director/CEO and Non-Executive Directors are set out in 
the Board Charter which is available on Public Bank’s corporate 
website at www.publicbankgroup.com.
Company Secretary
The Board is supported by a qualified and competent Company 
Secretary who provides advice on governance matters, Board 
policies and procedures as well as requirements to be observed 
by the Company and the Directors arising from new statutes and 
guidelines issued by the regulatory authorities. The Company 
Secretary also facilitates timely communication of decisions made 
and policies set by the Board at Board meetings, to the Senior 
Management for action.

Board Meetings, Attendance and Access to Information
Board meetings for the ensuing financial year are scheduled in 
advance before the end of the current financial year so that the 
Directors are able to plan ahead and ensure their full attendance 
at Board meetings.
The Board holds regular meetings of not less than 16 times a year. 
In addition to monthly Board meetings, the Board also meets as 
soon as the Bank’s quarterly and annual results are finalised in 
order to review and approve the results for submission to BNM. 
Special Board meetings may be convened as and when necessary 
to consider urgent proposals or matters that require the Board’s 
expeditious review or consideration.
Pursuant to the BNM Policy Document on Corporate Governance, 
the quorum for Board meetings is at least half the number of the 
Board Members and a Director is required to attend at least 75% 
of the Board meetings held in each financial year. All Directors had 
registered full attendance at Board meetings held in 2023 except 
for one Director who did not attend one Board meeting due to 
medical reason.
At the monthly Board meetings, the Board reviews management 
reports on the business performance of the Bank as well as the 
Group and major subsidiaries, and reviews, inter-alia, the results 
compared with the preceding month and year-to-date, and also 
the comparison against pro-rated business targets and against the 
industry. As part of the integrated risk management initiatives, the 
Board is informed of the decisions and salient issues deliberated 
by the Audit Committee, Risk Management Committee, Compliance 
Committee, Credit Risk Management Committee, Board 
Sustainability Management Committee and Management Working 
Committees through minutes of these committees. The Board 
Members deliberate on and, in the process, assess the viability of 
business propositions and corporate proposals, and the principal 
risks that may have significant impact on the Bank’s business or 
on its financial position, and the mitigating factors. The Board also 
assesses various types of credit propositions and matters that are 
required to be submitted to the Board for concurrence or approval, 
in accordance with the relevant regulatory requirements.
The Chairs of various Board Committees would inform the Directors 
at Board meetings, of salient recommendations and matters that 
may have arisen at their respective meetings which require the 
Board’s notice or direction to be given to the Management.
The minutes of various Board Committees meetings which record 
the key deliberations and the decisions taken during these 
meetings are circulated to all Board Members for noting together 
with the monthly Board meeting agenda items.
To facilitate productive and meaningful deliberations, the 
proceedings of the Board meetings are conducted in accordance 
with a structured agenda. The agenda together with comprehensive 
management reports and proposal papers are furnished to the 
Directors at least 7 days before the Board meeting. 
This is to allow time for the Directors to review the Board papers 
and to facilitate full discussion at Board meetings. The meeting 
papers are uploaded onto a secure portal which is accessible by 
the Directors from the electronic devices provided by the Bank.
The Board Members are well prepared for Board meetings and 
engage in robust discussions on key matters on the agenda. The 
Managing Director/CEO provides comprehensive monthly updates 
to the Board on the Bank’s and the Group’s business operations.
A Director is required to abstain from deliberations and decisions 
of the Board on matters where he/she is an interested party, so 
that he/she does not exercise any influence over the Board’s 
decision in respect of the matter. In the event that a corporate 
proposal is required to be approved by shareholders, interested 
Directors are required to abstain from voting on their shares held 
in Public Bank on the shareholders’ resolutions pertaining to the 
corporate proposal, and will further undertake to ensure that 
persons connected to them similarly abstain from voting on the 
relevant shareholders’ resolutions.
The minutes of Board meetings are circulated to all Directors for 
their perusal prior to confirmation of the minutes to be done at the 
commencement of the following Board meeting and thereafter 
signed by the Chairman of meeting.
The Deputy CEO attends all Board meetings by invitation, while 
the Senior Chief Operating Officers and Senior Management 
Officers are invited to attend Board meetings to report on matters 
pertaining to their respective areas of responsibility, and also to 
brief and provide details to the Directors on recommendations or 
reports submitted to the Board. The Chief Financial Officer also 
attends Board meetings by invitation to update the Board on 
financial guidelines issued by BNM and new accounting standards, 
and to brief the Board on matters relating to the finance portfolio, 
such as guidelines and policies to be implemented by the Bank 
pursuant to BNM policy documents or new accounting standards.
Some Directors also sit on the Boards of Public Bank’s subsidiaries, 
and this gives the Board access to direct insight of the performance 
and operations of the subsidiaries. In addition, in promoting Group 
governance and as part of the enhanced Public Bank’s oversight 
over its subsidiaries, the CEOs of the domestic and overseas 
subsidiaries have to escalate the reporting of significant events  
(if any) to the Bank’s Board as soon as practicable.
Board Charter
The Board Charter serves as the primary reference that guides the 
governance and conduct of the Board. It sets out the roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, Board Committees, individual Directors 
and Management in upholding sound corporate governance 
standards and practices. The Board Charter reflects the procedures 
of the Board and matters reserved for the Board’s consideration 
and approval. The Board Charter is subject to periodic review to 
ensure it remains fit for purpose. The Board Charter is available on 
Public Bank’s corporate website at www.publicbankgroup.com.

Sustainability Management
The Board remains the ultimate body accountable for Public Bank’s 
sustainability agenda, including climate-related matters. The Board 
is assisted by 2 Board Committees, being the Board Sustainability 
Management Committee and the Risk Management Committee. 
The Board Sustainability Management Committee provides 
enhanced oversight in relation to Public Bank’s sustainability 
strategies, priorities and targets, while the Risk Management 
Committee is responsible for identifying, measuring, monitoring and 
mitigating enterprise climate-related risks.
A management level committee, the Sustainability Management 
Committee, oversees the overall management of Public Bank’s 
sustainability initiatives. The Sustainability Management Task Force 
assists the Sustainability Management Committee to drive and 
execute the implementation of sustainability and climate-related 
initiatives in the Bank’s operations.
Sustainability remains a key focus for the Board in the development 
of Public Bank’s business strategies and action plans. Sustainability 
considerations, including matters relating to climate strategy, are 
embedded within the business planning processes.
The Board Members regularly attend training to equip themselves 
with the required knowledge, and to keep abreast of the latest 
developments in sustainability management. To this end, the 
Board also ensures the Bank continuously invests in employee 
development and learning in relation to sustainability.
Mindful of the importance of having a meaningful stakeholder 
engagement, the Board ensures regular engagements with various 
stakeholders are carried out to communicate its sustainability 
initiatives and progress. Among others, sustainability disclosures 
are communicated via the Sustainability Report in the Public Bank 
Annual Report.
By leveraging the investor relation platform, the Board and 
Management communicate with stakeholders on the Bank’s 
sustainability efforts to meet their sustainability expectations. The 
Bank has established a dedicated sustainability section on its 
corporate website, and a sustainability email address for 
stakeholders to direct their sustainability-related inquiries, comments 
or feedback.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT

---- Page 283 ----
Board Size and Composition
The Board currently comprises 9 Members. During the financial 
year 2023, Ms Teoh Meow Choo was appointed as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 November 2023. The 
size and composition of the Board are optimum to provide for a 
diversity of views, facilitate effective decision making, and 
appropriate balance of Executive, Independent and 
Non-Independent Directors. The present Board comprises 
Members who bring experiences from various disciplines, 
particularly banking and finance, business administration, 
accountancy, business advisory, information technology and legal 
sectors.
The 9 Members of the Board are persons of high calibre and 
integrity, and they have a sound understanding of the Bank’s 
business as well as high level of industry experience and expertise. 
They possess the skills, knowledge, experience and competencies 
to address key risks and major issues relating to the Bank’s 
business and its policies and strategies.
The Directors more than adequately fulfill the fit and proper criteria 
as specified in the Financial Services Act 2013 (“FSA”), the BNM 
Policy Document on Fit and Proper Criteria as well as the Bank’s 
Fit and Proper Policy for Directors. None of the Members of the 
Board is an active politician.
The profile of each Member of the Board is as presented on 
pages 130 to 138 of this 2023 Integrated Annual Report.
Board Balance and Independence
The Board currently comprises only 1 Executive Director and a 
strong presence of 8 Non-Executive Directors, of whom 5 are 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, thus constituting the majority 
on the Board. The presence of a majority of Independent  
Non-Executive Directors provides effective check and balance in 
the functioning of the Board to safeguard the interests of the Bank 
and all stakeholders.
Based on the outcome of the Board Effectiveness Evaluation 
exercise conducted by the independent external consultant for 
financial year 2023, all the Independent Non-Executive Directors 
continue to meet the criteria of an Independent Director as 
specified in the BNM Policy Document on Corporate Governance 
and the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Main Market Listing 
Requirements. An Independent Non-Executive Director has an 
ongoing obligation to inform the Board of any circumstances which 
could impair his or her independence.
Gender Diversity
In line with the best practices of the MCCG 2021, the Board has 
in place a gender diversity policy whereby the Board shall 
comprise at least 30% women Directors. The current Board has 
exceeded the 30% benchmark with 44% or 4 out of the 9 
Members of the Board comprising women Directors. The 4 
women Directors contribute to the Board’s cognitive variety, 
enriching discussions with diverse perspectives and approaches. 
Their unique viewpoints enhance the overall value brought to 
Board’s deliberation.
Tenure of Independent Directors
The maximum tenure of an Independent Non-Executive Director is 
a cumulative term of 9 years. Upon reaching such maximum 
tenure, the Independent Non-Executive Director may continue to 
serve on the Board but shall be redesignated as Non-Independent 
Non-Executive Director. During the financial year 2023, Ms Cheah 
Kim Ling was redesignated from Independent Non-Executive 
Director to Non-Independent Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 29 April 2023 upon reaching the maximum 9 years tenure as 
an Independent Non-Executive Director.

New Appointment and Re-Appointment of Director
Suitable candidates will be identified to fill vacancies on the Board 
as and when they arise. The Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee will source the curriculum vitae of potential candidates 
from diverse channels including recommendations from Board 
Members and/or may leverage on external sources such as

the dynamic demands of the ever-evolving financial industry.
Pursuant to provisions of the FSA and policy documents and 
guidelines issued by BNM, the proposed appointment of a new 
Director is subject to the prior approval of BNM, and the term of 
appointment shall be as specified by BNM in its approval. The

assessing the candidate for proposed directorship and thereupon 
submitting their recommendation to the Board for decision.

fitness and propriety of Directors whose current term of appointment 
as approved by BNM is due to expire, and for submitting their 
recommendation to the Board for decision on the submission of 
the application to BNM for the proposed re-appointment of the 
Director concerned.

General Meeting of Public Bank, one-third of the Directors for the 
time being or the number nearest to one-third, and those Directors 
newly appointed subsequent to the preceding Annual General 
Meeting, shall retire from office and shall be eligible for re-election.

office once at least in each 3 years but shall be eligible for

Committee whereupon recommendation will be submitted to the 
Board for decision to table the resolution on the re-election of the 
Director concerned for shareholders’ approval at the next Annual

Time Commitment
To ensure that Directors do not have competing time commitments 
that will impair their ability to discharge their duties effectively, the 
Board has established a policy on the maximum number of 
directorships in public listed companies, non-public listed 
companies and positions in non-profit organisations that a Director 
can hold in Malaysia and offshore/overseas, which is as follows:
•
 Maximum 
of 5 directorships held in public listed companies.
•
 Maximum of 15 directorships/positions held in non-public listed
 
companies and non-profit organisations.
All Directors are in compliance with the Policy on Maximum 
Number of Directorships and they remain fully committed in 
carrying out their duties and responsibilities. The Directors are able 
to give adequate time commitment to their duties and responsibilities 
as reflected by their full attendance at the Board meetings held 
during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 except for one 
Director who did not attend one Board meeting due to medical 
reason.
The Directors demonstrate virtuous commitment and high level of 
accountability, and are steadfast in devoting time and providing 
crucial support in steering Public Bank to greater heights.
Directors’ Training
Directors’ training is an on-going process as the Directors 
acknowledge the need to continually develop and refresh their 
knowledge and skills, and to update themselves on developments 
in the financial industry and business landscape both domestically

members of the FIDE Programme, which is set up to enhance 
corporate governance practices adopted by the boards of financial 
institutions and to develop world class directors who are advocates 
of best practices and excellence in corporate governance. The 
Directors had also kept up-to-date with market developments and 
related issues through Board discussion at meetings with the 
Deputy CEO, Senior Chief Operating Officers, Chief Financial 
Officer and other Senior Management Officers.

The Company Secretary and Secretaries of Audit Committee, 
Compliance Committee, Risk Management Committee and Board 
Sustainability Management Committee regularly update and 
apprise the Directors on new statutes, policy documents and 
guidelines issued by the regulatory authorities, and the requirements 
to be observed by the Company and Directors thereupon.
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee conducts annual 
review of training received by the Directors during each financial 
year and recommends to the Board for approval, the budget for 
Directors’ training and development on yearly basis.
During the financial year 2023, the Directors had participated in

Corporate Governance Report for the financial year ended 
31 December 2023 which can be downloaded from Public Bank’s

Board Effectiveness Evaluation
The Board has established an annual performance evaluation 
process to assess the performance and effectiveness of the Board 
and Board Committees, as well as the performance of each 
Director and each Audit Committee Member. The Board evaluation 
exercise assists the Board to address any gaps and improvement 
required for the Board.
Practice 6.1 of the MCCG 2021 stipulates that the Board should 
undertake a formal and objective annual evaluation to determine 
the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and each individual 
Director. For large companies, the Board should engage an 
independent expert at least every 3 years, to facilitate objective 
and candid board evaluation.
In line with Practice 6.1 of the MCCG 2021, the Board has, upon 
the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT

---- Page 287 ----
Following the Board Effectiveness Evaluation exercise conducted 
by the independent external consultant for financial year ended 
31  December 2023, several notable positive highlights were 
observed. The Board Chairman’s leadership skills are noteworthy, 
as he effectively guides the Board and serves as an open facilitator 
during discussions. The overall dynamics and commitment within 
the Board are commendable, marked by a culture of professionalism, 
respect and collegiality. The Board benefits from the diverse 
industry experience brought by seasoned Directors, contributing to 
a Board governance characterised by virtuous commitment and 
high standard of accountability.
Moving forward, there is an opportunity for enhancing the 
Boardroom configuration, particularly by reinforcing digital expertise 
and upskilling on the ESG front at the Board level.
Directors’ Remuneration
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends the 
level and structure of Directors’ remuneration and ensures that the 
level of remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is linked to their 
level of responsibilities undertaken and contributions to the effective 
functioning of the Board. In making its recommendation, the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee considers the 
responsibilities of the Directors and also by benchmarking against 
the Directors’ fees structure of peer banks, in order to be competitive 
to retain skills and talent, and achieve diversity, on the Board.
In 2023, the Board had upon the recommendation of the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee, engaged an external consultant to 
conduct an independent review of the Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration structure (“Board Remuneration Review”) to assist the 
Board in establishing a transparent and robust remuneration 
framework for Non-Executive Directors that takes into account the 
demands and complexities of the Public Bank Group as well as the 
skills and experience required of the Non-Executive Directors.  
The Board Remuneration Review also serves to ascertain whether 
the Non-Executive Directors’ quantum and composition of 
remuneration are competitive and align with peer banks.
Based on the outcome of the analyses of Public Bank  
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration vis-à-vis market, sectorial 
and comparator benchmarks for Public Bank’s Board and Board 
Committees, the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors are 
generally aligned with the market. However, in the case of the 
Chairman’s remuneration, it was highlighted that the remuneration 
accorded to the Chairman was not aligned with the market norms 
where Board Chairmen are typically compensated with a special 
allowance vis-à-vis Non-Executive Directors, given the heightened 
responsibility assumed. Arising from the outcome of the review, and 
in order to be in line with the market norms, the Board, upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, 
proposed, subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 8 May 2024 that the remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 
2023 shall be based on the following fee structure:

Senior Management
Strong and deep-rooted corporate governance and professional 
business ethics are fundamental to an organisation’s continued 
success and sustainable financial strength. These pillars enable the 
Bank to remain strong and resilient despite the evolving business 
landscapes and challenges.
The CEO together with a competent team of Senior Management 
are entrusted with the stewardship of perpetuating sound corporate 
governance across the full spectrum of business and operations 
and all levels of employees.
The CEO and the Senior Management collectively play a pivotal 
role in the development and implementation of the corporate goals 
and strategic business plans in accordance with the directions as 
set out by the Board of Directors.
There is a clear segregation of responsibilities among the Senior 
Management to ensure an appropriate balance of roles, 
responsibilities and accountabilities in support of a strong control 
environment. It also serves as an embedded check and balance 
mechanism for the day-to-day business and operations.
The Bank’s control functions namely, Risk Management Division, 
Compliance Division and Internal Audit Division are independent 
and report directly to their respective Board Committees. The 
control functions are responsible to inculcate a compliance and 
risk awareness culture through robust internal control mechanism 
including compliance with regulatory requirements and conduct 
periodic review to ensure these policies and procedures are well 
implemented and complied with.
Senior Management Appointment and Removal
The Bank’s Fit and Proper Policy outlines the structured process 
and procedure relating to the appointment and removal of Key 
Responsible Persons (“KRPs”) and the stringent assessment of 
candidates against the requirements. All KRPs are assessed to 
have met all the fit and proper criteria based on the following 
factors:
•
 Probity, 
Personal Integrity and Reputation
•
 Competence 
and Capability
•
 Financial 
Integrity
•
 They do not hold an aggregate interest of 5% or more in the
 
shares of Public Bank.
Succession Planning
Human capital is the catalyst towards sustainable business growth 
and succession management is essential to leadership continuity 
and business sustainability in meeting the Group’s long term goals 
and objectives.
The Group has put in place a robust succession planning process 
which covers multi-pronged talent identification and development 
approaches to identify and build a pool of talents with the right 
skill sets, experience and leadership qualities to prepare them for 
succession to all the Key Leadership Positions within the Bank.
A 3-dimensional assessment which covers aspects of talents’ 
competency, behavioural tendencies and career aspirations provides 
a holistic view of their talents, strengths and developmental gaps. 
286 Public Bank Berhad  |  2023 Integrated Annual Report
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT

---- Page 289 ----
In addition, the talents are subject to periodic assessment on their 
competencies which serves as a ‘health check’ of the talent pool 
to enable early interventions to ensure a seamless succession plan.
The career path for the identified talents is specially curated to 
harness their potential as well as leadership skills. Customised 
individual developmental plans which include accelerated and 
customised learning opportunities are developed to nurture the 
talents thus closing the identified gaps and fast-tracking their 
development to address critical positions.
The Bank continues to adopt a ‘Look Within’ policy to empower 
identified talents to assume higher responsibilities whilst retaining 
the invaluable corporate knowledge and ensure that corporate 
values are embedded at Senior Management level.
The Bank regularly refines its succession management approaches 
and democratises the talent experience through differentiated,  
fit-for-purpose career paths and customised development plans.  
In 2023, the structured succession planning framework has also 
been cascaded to include middle management employees to 
further strengthen the leadership pipeline and talent supply chain.
The Bank’s succession planning policy and programme is subject 
to review and approval of the Board, assisted by the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee and is collectively implemented by 
the Senior Management team.
Remuneration Policy & Practice
The Public Bank Remuneration Policy is established to put in place 
a framework which drives performance with appropriate risk-taking 
behaviour and reinforces the Bank’s corporate and risk culture.
The subject of sustainability has been integrated into the long-term 
strategic plans as well as performance assessment of the C-Suites 
and Senior Management to uphold sustainability practices across 
the Bank’s operations, whilst contributing to a more sustainable 
and responsible society.
The quantitative ESG key performance indicator (“KPI”) on 
“Achievement of Sustainability Targets in respect of ESG Initiatives” 
was introduced for Heads of Divisions since financial year 2022. In 
2023, the same ESG KPI has been included in the performance 
assessment of the C-Suites to be consistent with the collective 
responsibility in driving and implementing the sustainability roadmap 
of the Group.
The Bank’s Remuneration Policy is reviewed by the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of 
Directors for implementation across all levels of employees 
including Senior Management and other employees not governed 
by any collective agreement in the Bank.
Senior Management in this context refers to management 
employees who are KRPs as defined in the Bank’s Fit and Proper 
Policy as well as persons who are accountable or responsible for 
the management and oversight of the Bank, comprising the 
following:
•
 
CEO
•
 Deputy 
CEO
•
 Senior 
Officers, defined as follows:
i.
 KRPs who are defined under BNM Policy Document on Fit
 
and Proper Criteria as those who have primary and 
significant responsibility for the management and 
performance of significant business activities of the Group.
ii. Other Senior Management performing group-wide
 
management responsibilities.
iii.
 Other 
Senior Management who are Heads of Divisions.
The remuneration framework is designed to ensure that reward is 
measurably linked to the achievement of business and performance 
objectives. However, to prevent any conflict of interest, the 
framework stipulates that employees of the control functions are to 
be assessed independently from the business units. For effective 
segregation, these employees are appraised principally based on 
the achievement of their control objectives set out by the Board 
Committees of their respective control function and differentiated 
from the business units.
The remuneration framework outlines the total compensation 
packages of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration payable 
to employees. Fixed remuneration refers to basic salary and other 
fixed income, commensurate with the role and position of an 
individual employee, including professional experience, qualifications, 
responsibilities, job complexity and local market condition etc.
The variable remuneration refers to the discretionary performance 
bonus which is cash-based and does not consist of shares or 
non-cash instruments. The pool for the variable remuneration is 
determined by financial matrices such as the Bank’s overall 
performance, achievement of selected financial ratios, market 
trends and economic outlook.
The variable performance bonus for the Senior Management is 
separated into two main components with different pay-out criteria. 
The first component of the performance bonus is linked to the 
individual performance of Senior Management and the pay-out 
above a set threshold is subject to a deferment of 3 years. The 
proportion of the deferred amount corresponds to the level of risks 
assumed by the respective job positions.
The prescribed deferred amount of performance bonus is further 
subject to a multi-year framework, minimally a 3-year graded 
vesting with a proportionate rate of 35%/35%/30% and payable 
annually at the end of each vested period.
287Bank For The People
Corporate
Governance

---- Page 290 ----
The second component of the variable performance bonus is 
cash-based and linked to the Total Shareholder’s Return (“TSR”) 
of the Bank. However, it is cliff-vested over a period of 3 years. 
The quantum is calculated as a percentage of the individual 
eligible performance bonus for the prevailing financial year but 
payable at the end of the cliff-vested period of 3 years and 
further subject to the TSR achievement and good individual 
performance.
The variable performance bonus, whether it is vested or unvested, 
is subject to adjustments (e.g. malus, clawback and other 
reversals or downward revaluation of awards) in the event of poor 
performance of the business unit or the Bank, attributable to the 
individual or if he/she commits serious legal, regulatory or internal 
policy breaches. The awards may be clawed back within 3 years 
from the date of payment to the employee.
Members of Senior Management have committed not to 
undertake activities (such as personal hedging strategies and 
liability-related insurance) that will undermine the risk alignment 
effects embedded in their remuneration.

paid out to Senior Management employees of Public Bank for

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is established by the Board and currently 
comprises 5 Members, all of whom are Independent  
Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of the Board is not a 
Member of the Audit Committee.
The composition, authority as well as the roles and responsibilities 
of the Audit Committee are set out in its terms of reference which 
are approved by the Board and published on Public Bank’s 
corporate website at www.publicbankgroup.com.
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference stipulate that, among 
others, a former partner of the Bank’s external audit firm is to 
observe a cooling-off period of at least 3 years before being 
appointed as a Member of the Audit Committee. Pursuant to this 
requirement, none of the Members of the Audit Committee is 
associated with or had been a former partner of the Bank’s 
appointed external audit firm in the past 3 years.
The Members of the Audit Committee collectively have a wide 
range of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to discharge 
their duties. These include accounting, assurance and advisory 
services, information technology and banking related expertise and 
experience, ranging from finance/corporate finance and consumer/
investment banking. In addition, 1 Member of the Audit Committee 
is a Chartered Accountant of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants.
With the relevant skill sets, knowledge and experience, the Audit 
Committee Members are financially literate and are able to 
understand, analyse and challenge matters under the purview of 
the Audit Committee, including the financial reporting process.
In 2023, the Audit Committee Members have attended various 
training courses, conferences, seminars and topical talks arranged 
by the Bank’s Knowledge & Learning to keep themselves abreast 
of the relevant and latest developments in the banking industry, 
including accounting and auditing standards, relevant regulatory 
requirements as well as effective governance practices.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing the financial 
reporting process and assessment of the reliability of the financial 
reporting and financial positions of Public Bank and the Public Bank 
Group. The Audit Committee also seeks explanations and additional 
information from the Senior Management team, including the Chief 
Financial Officer and the Group Chief Internal Auditor in regard to the 
financial performance and preparation of the financial statements of 
Public Bank and the Public Bank Group. In addition, the Audit 
Committee also meets with the Bank’s external auditors to discuss 
their audit plan, audit findings and observations on the annual and 
interim financial results of Public Bank and the Public Bank Group.
The details of the duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee 
are set out under the Audit Committee Report on pages 312 to 317 
of this 2023 Integrated Annual Report.
Relationship with External Auditors
The Audit Committee assesses the suitability, objectivity and 
independence as well as the performance of the external auditors. 
In performing this role, the Audit Committee reviews and conducts 
assessment, on an annual basis, the appointment or re-appointment 
of external auditors in accordance with the criteria as set out in 
the Public Bank Group’s Policies and Procedures for Appointment/
Re-appointment of External Auditors for Audit and Non-Audit 
Services (Group Policies and Procedures) to ascertain that the 
independence and objectivity of the external auditors as statutory 
auditors are not compromised. The Group Policies and Procedures 
are in line with the requirements stipulated in the BNM Policy 
Document on External Auditors.
The assessments of the external auditors for audit and non-audit 
services are carried out vide an assessment checklist in accordance 
with the assessment criteria as set out in the Group Policies and 
Procedures. This assessment checklist covers all relevant 
professional and regulatory requirements, the competency, audit 
quality and resources capacity of the external auditors relating to 
the audit and non-audit services as well as the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors.
Before Management can engage the external auditors to provide 
any non-audit services to Public Bank and/or the Public Bank 
Group, the Audit Committee has to be satisfied that the external 
auditors are suitable, independent and objective in the provision of 
such services. The Audit Committee must also be satisfied with 
the nature and extent of the non-audit services, there is no

Risk Management and Internal Control Framework
The Bank has established a risk management and internal control 
system that enables the identification, measurement, mitigation, 
continuous monitoring and reporting of all relevant and material 
risks on a group and entity-wide basis, including new and 
emerging risks. The Board ensures that the risk management and 
internal control system manages the Public Bank Group’s relevant 
and material risks within its risk appetite in the Public Bank 
Group’s pursuit of its strategies and business objectives.
The establishment of the risk management and internal control 
system is driven by the Public Bank Group’s Risk Management 
Framework which is approved by the Board and developed based 
on the BNM Policy Document on Risk Governance. The key 
elements of the Public Bank Group’s Risk Management Framework 
set out the requirements for effective risk management covering 
risk governance, risk appetite, risk management processes and 
risk culture.
The adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control system as well as the level of compliance with the 
relevant laws, regulations, policies and procedures are subject to 
ongoing assessment by the Risk Management Function, 
Compliance Function and Internal Audit Function. The Board in 
discharging its risk and internal control oversight responsibilities is 
assisted by the independent control functions, the Risk Management 
Committee, the Credit Risk Management Committee, the 
Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Board receives assurance from the Managing Director/CEO 
and the Chief Financial Officer on the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Public Bank Group’s risk management and internal control 
system on an annual basis.
For further information, please refer to the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control as set out on pages 295 to 301 
of this 2023 Integrated Annual Report.
Risk Management Committee
The Risk Management Committee is established by the Board and 
supports the Board in carrying out its risk management roles and 
responsibilities as delegated and authorised by the Board. 
Currently, it comprises 8 Members of whom 5 Members including 
the Chair of the Risk Management Committee are Independent 
Directors. All Members are Non-Executive Directors. The Chair of 
the Risk Management Committee is appointed by the Board and 
is not the Chair of the Board. The Risk Management Committee 
assists the Board in discharging its risk and internal control 
oversight responsibilities.
Public Bank’s IAD is staffed by 200 individuals and a majority of 
them are equipped with the relevant experiences and qualifications. 
IAD comprises 9 sections which specialise in auditing the various 
business areas of Public Bank.
The Group Chief Internal Auditor (“GCIA”), Mr Lim Then Fui  
(Mr Lim) oversees the Internal Audit functions of Public Bank and 
the Public Bank Group. He is a Chartered Accountant of the 
Malaysian Institute of Accountants and a Member of the Malaysian 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and a Certified Bank 
Auditor. Mr Lim has a total of 44 years of working experience in 
auditing, risk management, compliance and commercial banking.
The Internal Audit Charter sets out the purpose, objectives, 
authority, scope of work and responsibilities of the Internal Audit 
function in Public Bank and the Public Bank Group. The Internal 
Audit Charter, which has been drawn up with reference to the 
relevant guidelines and policy documents issued by BNM and the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is reviewed annually to 
ensure that it remains relevant and is updated with the latest 
developments in the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Internal Audit Charter is published in the Public Bank’s intranet for 
all the staff of Public Bank and the Public Bank Group to access.
To reflect the independence of Internal Audit function, IAD staff 
report directly to the GCIA, who in turn reports functionally to the 
Board through the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
approves the appointment, replacement and dismissal of the 
GCIA, evaluates the GCIA’s performance and reviews the 
remuneration and/or bonus, if any, payable to the GCIA and the 
Senior Management staff of IAD.
The Internal Audit function performs ongoing periodic reviews and 
assessments on the Bank’s risk management systems, internal 
controls, anti-corruption, whistleblowing and governance processes 
in accordance with and conforming to the requirements set out in 
the BNM’s Guidelines on Internal Audit Function of Licensed 
Institutions as well as MCCG 2021.
As part of the measures to ascertain that IAD staff are free from 
any relationship or conflicts of interest situations which could 
impair their objectivity and independence, IAD staff who are 
transferred from other divisions or branches within the Bank are 
not allowed to conduct audit on areas where they were previously 
engaged, until the “cooling off” period is over or after an 
independent audit has been conducted, whichever is earlier. For 
this purpose, the “cooling off” period shall not be less than 6 
months from the date they joined IAD or such longer period as 
may be determined by the GCIA. Staff upon joining IAD are 
required to declare to the GCIA that they are free from any 
relationships or conflicts of interest that could impair their objectivity.
The details of the Audit Committee’s oversight over the activities 
carried out by the Internal Audit function are set out under the 
Audit Committee Report on pages 312 to 317 of this 2023 
Integrated Annual Report.

BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board is overall responsible for establishing a sound risk 
management and internal control system, as well as subjecting it 
to review for its adequacy and effectiveness in identifying, assessing 
and responding to risks surfaced during the course of the Public 
Bank Group’s business operations.
The Board is responsible to set the tone and culture of effective 
risk management and internal controls and this is through the 
establishment of the Public Bank Group’s risk appetite, risk 
strategies and risk policies, articulating the risk types and levels of 
risk the Group is willing to accept in the pursuit of its business and 
strategic objectives.  In this respect, the Board actively participates 
in the Group’s strategic directions and plans, ensuring formulation 
of business plans and risk taking activities are within the risk 
appetite.  In view of the inherent limitations in any risk management 
and internal control system, the risk management and internal 
control system can therefore only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against the occurrence of any material financial 
misstatement, fraud or losses.
To ensure the effective oversight of a sound risk management and 
internal control system, the Board is assisted by the Risk 
Management Committee, the Compliance Committee and the 
Audit Committee with delegated authorities to oversee matters 
relating to risk, compliance and controls respectively.  
The Board has received assurance from the Managing Director/
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer that the 
Public Bank Group’s risk management and internal control system 
is operating adequately and effectively.
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITIES
The Management is overall responsible for effective implementation of 
the risk and controls framework and policies approved by the Board 
in the day-to-day management of the Public Bank Group’s business 
operations. To this end, the Management’s key responsibilities on risk 
management and internal control system include:
•
 Formulating processes and internal practices to operationalise
 
the risk policies and risk limits
•
 Ensuring all relevant and material risks including emerging risks
 
associated with the Public Bank Group’s business operations 
are identified, assessed and mitigated to the levels within the 
risk appetite or risk limits
•
 Designing monitoring and reporting procedures to ensure risks
 
identified are surfaced for deliberation and actions
•
 Implementing remedial actions to address any new or emerging
 
risks or any deficiencies as identified or as directed by the Board
RISK MANAGEMENT

identification, measurement, mitigation and monitoring of all 
relevant and material risks of the Group including emerging risks.

 Risk 
Appetite
The risk appetite defines the amount and types of risk that the Public Bank Group is able and willing to accept in pursuit of its 
business objectives. It also reflects the level of risk tolerance and limits to govern the Group’s risk-taking activities. The Group risk 
appetite is articulated via a set of risk indicators, risk limits and risk guiding principles. All entities within the Group are required to 
develop risk indicators and risk limits having considered the Group’s risk guiding principles and the respective entities’ strategic 
business directions, risk taking capacity, risk profile and the operating environment.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

---- Page 303 ----
CONCLUSION 
From the updates received from the Board Committees and assurance from the Management, the Board is of the view the Public Bank 
Group’s risk management and internal control system is generally adequate and effective to safeguard the interests of shareholders, 
customers, employees and the Group’s assets for the financial year under review and up to the date of approval of this Statement.
On the areas with heightened regulatory emphasis and heightened risks, particularly in the areas of cyber threat and information technology, 
Shariah compliance, anti-money laundering, counter financing of terrorism and counter proliferation financing, the Board continued to 
intensify its focus on these areas. All actions taken to manage the risks were reviewed to ensure effective and timely resolution. The Board 
will continue to review and enhance the internal controls, policies and procedures in response to developments in the operating and 
regulatory environment. 
REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
The external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control pursuant to the scope set out in Audit and 
Assurance Practice Guide 3 (“AAPG 3”), Guidance for Auditors on Engagements to Report on the Statement on Risk Management and 
Internal Control included in the Annual Report issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants for inclusion in the annual report of the 
Public Bank Group for the year ended 31 December 2023, and reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes 
them to believe that the statement intended to be included in the annual report of the Group, in all material respects:
a)
 has not been prepared in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk Management
 
and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers; or
b)
 is 
factually inaccurate.
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether the Directors’ Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control 
covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Public Bank Group’s risk management and 
internal control system including the assessment and opinion by the Board and management thereon. The auditors are also not required 
to consider whether the processes described to deal with material internal control aspects of any significant problems disclosed in the annual 
report will, in fact, remedy the problems.

Audit Committee’s Oversight Over the Implementation of 
Whistleblowing Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee oversees the implementation of Public 
Bank’s whistleblowing policies and procedures that set out the 
avenues or channels for Public Bank’s staff and other relevant 
stakeholders such as vendors, suppliers, contractors, consultants 
and interns to report, in confidence and without the risk of reprisal, 
instances of any illegal, unethical or questionable practices.
Public Bank had further strengthened its whistleblowing policies 
and procedures taking into consideration the requirements set out 
in Bank Negara Malaysia’s Policy Document on Corporate 
Governance as well as the requirements under the Public Bank 
Group’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, which was last 
reviewed and approved by Board of Director on 27 April 2023. 
Pursuant to the Bank Negara Malaysia’s Policy Document on 
Corporate Governance, the Board of Directors had appointed the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee as the designated non-executive 
director responsible for the effective implementation of the 
whistleblowing policies and procedures, encompassing how 
disclosures on concerns are timely escalated and dealt with 
including the punitive action taken against errant staff.
INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
Internal Audit function, being the third line of defence, is responsible 
to provide independent assessment of the Bank’s state of 
compliance with statutory/regulatory requirements and adherence 
to internal policies and procedures. The assessment also covers 
the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management systems, 
internal controls, anti-corruption, whistleblowing and governance 
processes put in place by Public Bank and the Public Bank Group 
to manage and mitigate the key areas of risk. 
The Internal Audit Charter (“IAC”) sets out the purpose, objectives, 
authority, scope of work and responsibilities of the Internal Audit 
function in Public Bank and the Public Bank Group. The IAC, 
which has been drawn up with reference to the relevant guidelines 
and Policy Documents issued by Bank Negara Malaysia and the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, is reviewed and 
updated annually. The revised IAC which was approved by the 
Board of Directors on 28 June 2023, is published at the Public 
Banks’s electronic publication homepage on 6 July 2023 and a 
copy of which was extended to the Internal Audit function of 
subsidiary companies for their adoption. 
The Public Bank’s Internal Audit has a total staff strength of 200 
and comprises nine (9) sections, specialising in various auditing/
business areas. Most of the Internal Audit staff possessed the 
relevant experience and qualifications. The GCIA reports directly to 
the Audit Committee. The Internal Audit function has unfettered 
access to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee and the Bank’s 
Senior Management, as well as the authority to seek information 
and explanations, for the purpose of conducting its audit.
Internal Audit function provides independent assurance to the Audit 
Committee and the Bank’s Senior Management based on its report 
on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment 
of the areas audited upon the completion of each audit. Internal 
Audit adopts a risk-based approach to prioritise the audit work and 
to scope the audits on high risk auditable areas. Internal Audit’s 
assurance which covers a broad spectrum of business activities, 
support, control and operations audited including the Outsourced 
Service Providers, is to provide a reasonable assurance on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls in place to 
safeguard the assets and its quality, accuracy of records and 
transactions, compliance with relevant laws and regulations as well 
as adherence to established policies and procedures. 
Internal Audit’s assurance covers a comprehensive review of the 
established controls to determine if they are appropriate, effectively 
applied and consistent with Public Bank and the Public Bank 
Group’s risk management policies. Internal Audit’s recommendations

I. GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
Global economic activities expanded in 2023, supported by global 
demand and stable labour market. Global headline inflation edged 
higher in the first half of the year partly due to elevated commodity 
prices, while core inflation continued to moderate. Major central 
banks maintained their monetary policy settings amid moderate 
inflationary pressures. Domestic financial markets continued to be 
driven by evolving financial market expectations over the global 
monetary policy path.
In the United States of America (“US”), the Federal Reserve raised 
its federal funds rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% by the end of 
2023 (2022: 4.25-4.50%). Against this backdrop, the US dollar 
appreciated in 2023 amid the repatriation of funds to the US.
In Europe, the European Central Bank raised its main refinancing 
rate to 4.50% in 2023 (2022: 2.50%). Meanwhile, the Bank of 
England raised its key interest rate to 5.25% in 2023 
(2022: 3.50%).
Similarly, most central banks in Asia raised their key interest rates 
in 2023 but with several exceptions, among which include Bank of 
Japan (“BOJ”) and the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”). BOJ has 
been retaining its key policy rate at -0.10% since January 2016. 
Meanwhile, the PBOC’s one-year loan prime rate stood at 3.45% 
as at the end of 2023, following rate cuts during the year 
(2022: 3.65%).
II. MALAYSIAN ECONOMY: REVIEW
The Malaysian economy grew by 3.7% in 2023 (2022: 8.7%)  
(Table 1). Growth was mainly supported by domestic economic 
activities, albeit at a moderate pace.
Aggregate domestic demand grew at a slower pace owing to softer 
private consumption spending and private investment. Public sector 
investment grew partly attributable to the ongoing fiscal support.

On the supply side, most segments recorded an improvement in 
2023 (Table 2), except for manufacturing and mining sectors. 
Economic activities improved in 2023, including the services sector 
growth which was largely supported by consumer-related subsectors 
and tourism activities. The construction sector has also gathered 
pace amid progress of large infrastructure, commercial and industrial 
projects. As for the agriculture sector, oil palm output grew supported 
by the favourable weather conditions. Manufacturing sector was 
adversely affected, due to weakness in demand for electrical and 
electronic products. In the mining sector, production was hampered 
owing to lower production of refined petroleum products.

Malaysia’s inflation tapered to 1.5% in December 2023  
(Dec’22: 3.8%), primarily due to moderation in global oil prices 
(Graph 1).
Labour market has improved and the unemployment rate fell to 
3.3% in December 2023 (Dec’22: 3.6%) (Graph 2).
Banking System
The banking sector’s liquidity remained broadly stable. The 
industry’s Common Equity Tier I capital ratio, Tier I capital ratio and 
total capital ratio stood at 14.6%, 15.2% and 18.2%, respectively 
as at the end of 2023 (2022: 15.2%, 15.8% and 19.0%, respectively) 
(Graph 3), which remained well above the minimum regulatory 
requirements under Basel III. The gross impaired loans ratio was 
1.65% as at the end of 2023 (2022: 1.72%) (Graph 4). The loan 
to fund ratio stood at 81.8% as at the end of 2023 (2022: 82.5%) 
(Graph 5).

Malaysia: Monetary Aggregates, 2023
Source: Bank Negara Malaysia, Monthly Highlights and Statistics.
Banking sector indicators were supported by key economic 
activities nationwide. Total loans in the banking system grew by 
5.3% in December 2023 (2022: 5.7%) (Graph 6). Also, total 
deposits grew by 5.6% (2022: 5.9%), supported by deposits 
placements by most holders (Graph 7).
Monetary Aggregates
Monetary aggregates grew in 2023. Narrow money supply (“M1”) 
grew 5.9% in December 2023 (2022: 4.3%), mainly due to the 
decline in demand deposits. Meanwhile, broad money supply 
(“M3”) rose by 6.0% (2022: 4.3%), supported by several segments 
including fixed deposits and foreign currency deposits (Graph 8).
Monetary Policy
BNM raised the Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) to 3.00% in 2023, 
from 2.75% in 2022 (Table 3). The Statutory Reserve Requirement 
(“SRR”) Ratio was retained at 2.00% in 2023, to ensure ample 
liquidity to support financial intermediation activities (Graph 9). 
Interest rates for banks were adjusted higher in line with the 
increase in OPR in 2023. The base lending rate, average lending 
rate and weighted base rate rose to 6.68%, 5.45% and 3.67%, 
respectively as at the end of 2023 (2022: 6.42%, 4.87% and 
3.42%, respectively) (Graph 10). The average interest rate of 
savings deposits (“SD”) for commercial banks was 0.94% 
(2022: 0.85%), while the 3-month fixed deposits (“FD”) rate stood 
at 2.72% as at the end of 2023 (2022: 2.55%) (Graph 11).

External Position
Malaysia’s current account surplus narrowed in 2023, mainly due 
to higher deficits in the income accounts. Current account surplus 
amounted to RM22.78 billion or 1.3% of gross national income 
(“GNI”) (2022: RM55.10 billion or 3.2% of GNI) (Table 4).
Malaysia’s international reserves stood at USD113.48 billion as at 
the end of 2023 (2022: USD114.65 billion) (Graph 13), which is 
sufficient to finance 5.4 months of retained imports and 1.0 times 
the total short term external debt.

III. PROSPECTS FOR 2024
Headwinds in Global Trades
The global economy is expected to grow in 2024, albeit at a 
moderate pace. China’s economic activities are expected to grow, 
although growth would be slower-than-expected. The slower-than-
expected global growth is expected to be weighed by the 
anticipated downtrend in external trades, slower momentum in 
major economies, protracted geopolitical tension(s) and sharp 
tightening in financial market conditions. 
While global growth outlook is subjected to downside risks mainly 
stemming from weaker-than-expected external demand, upside 
risks to global growth could potentially emanate from tourism 
activities and recovery in the electrical and electronics down cycle.
In the US, consumer demand is expected to be adversely impacted 
as consumers have largely depleted excess savings accumulated 
during the pandemic. The euro area economy is also expected to 
face challenges amid global uncertainties.
Malaysia: Stable Fundamentals and Steady Domestic Demand 
The economic growth in Malaysia is expected to be backed by firm 
fundamentals, stable labour market conditions and its diversified 
economic structure. Steady domestic demand, services sector 
growth including tourism activities as well as further progress of 
investment and infrastructure projects will remain supportive of 
growth. National pursuits of sustainability encompassing a wide 
area of environmental, social and governance are expected to 
augur well for economic growth.
Domestic financial conditions remain conducive as the overall 
banking system remains resilient, underpinned by ample liquidity 
and healthy capital buffers. On the policy front, Malaysia’s macro 
landscape is supported by appropriate policies and reform initiatives 
which enhance business resilience, encourage domestic investments 
and strengthen the economy to withstand external shocks. Other 
supportive measures include providing financial and fiscal impetus 
to businesses in need, especially the small and medium enterprises.
Continued policy support will also help to cushion the impact of 
downside risks stemming from the global slowdown, geopolitical 
tension(s) and tight global financial conditions.

STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE IN 2023
Globally, financial-related turmoil in the first quarter of 2023 was 
partly due to the rapid global rate hikes in 2022. In the United 
States of America (“US”), two banks failed during the quarter 
(followed by another three bank failures during the year). In 
Europe, two banking giants in Switzerland, UBS and Credit Suisse 
announced a merger. Trading activity on Bursa Malaysia recovered 
with improved investor sentiment partly supported by the 
Government’s measures, including initiatives announced during the 
re-tabling of Budget 2023 in February 2023. Nonetheless, the 
benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia Composite Index (“FBM KLCI”) 
fell by 72.90 points or -4.9% quarter-on-quarter (“q-o-q”) to close 
at 1,422.59 points. Meanwhile, the Malaysian economy recorded 
Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth of 7.1% year-on-year 
(“y-o-y”) in the fourth quarter of 2022, following a 14.1% expansion 
in the preceding quarter.
Economic and financial market uncertainties were prevalent in the 
second quarter of the year, amid divergent paths taken by global 
central banks. The lacklustre domestic trading activity during the 
quarter amid weak investor sentiment were likely due to the 
perception of limited improvement in economic prospects amid the 
increasingly challenging external operating environment. The FBM 
KLCI slipped further by 45.91 points or -3.2% q-o-q to close at 
1,376.68 points. Growth of the Malaysian economy eased to 5.6% 
y-o-y in the first quarter of 2023.
PUBLIC BANK’S SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE IN 2023
Public Bank remained as the second largest company listed on Bursa Malaysia with market capitalisation of RM83.27 billion as at the end 
of 2023. The Bank’s shares traded in line with the movement of the FBM KLCI in 2023 but marginally lower compared to 2022. On 
average, the daily trading volume and value of the Bank’s shares recorded 15.2 million shares (2022: 19.3 million shares) and RM62.5 
million (2022: RM86.3 million) respectively in 2023.
Domestic trading activity improved in the third quarter of 2023. 
Investors were encouraged with the release of the country’s New 
Industrial Master Plan 2030 and Mid-Term Review of the Twelfth 
Malaysia Plan, which provided details on Malaysia’s medium- and 
longer-term growth plans. The FBM KLCI rose by 47.49 points or 
3.4% q-o-q to close at 1,424.17 points during the quarter, despite 
recording an initial increase to 1,465.93 points. This is despite the 
announcement of Malaysia’s GDP growth slowing notably to 2.9% 
y-o-y in the second quarter of 2023.
In the final quarter of the year, the FBM KLCI improved further by 
30.49 points or 2.1% q-o-q. The economy grew by 3.3% y-o-y in 
the third quarter of 2023 amid sustained positive sentiment and 
steady domestic demand, which mitigated external weaknesses. 
The US Federal Reserve signalled an end to its tightening cycle 
and guided that there will be three rate cuts in 2024 – which 
boosted the US equity markets as US Treasury yields fell. For the 
full year, the benchmark FBM KLCI fell by 40.83 points or -2.7% 
to close at 1,454.66 points as at the end of 2023.
