COMPANY PROFILE
7-ELEVEN MALAYSIA
7-Eleven was founded by J. C. Thompson in 1927 as The Southland Ice 
Company in Dallas, Texas. Started as an ice vendor, the company eventually 
began offering milk, bread and eggs on Sundays and evenings when  
grocery stores were closed. This new business idea produced satisfied 
customers and increased sales, spawning the precursor of the  
lifestyle convenience retail concept.

                       7-Eleven is  
Always There For You. 
Each 7-Eleven store carries over 2,500 SKUs, featuring 
our signature offering like Slurpee frozen beverages, our  
exclusive range of soft serve treats. 
7-Eleven now also offers more private label brands with  
better prices and higher quality and has expanded to about 
200 SKUs. 
Since 2021, 7-Eleven has introduced its innovative 7CAFé 
store format, elevating the standard with enhanced fresh  
food selections, expanded product offerings, enriched  
services, and an unparalleled in-store customer experience. 
By 2023, this pioneering concept has flourished, with the 
establishment of 247 7CAFé stores and the launch of a  
newly established commissary, QVI, dedicated to providing 
improved quality and variety of Ready-To-Eat Meals.
In 2023, the My7E loyalty app boasted an impressive 
membership of 3 million users. As we forge ahead, our 
commitment remains steadfast in enriching the experience 
for our valued members, offering an array of rewards that 
enhance their journey as My7E enthusiasts.
In 2022, in pursuit of efficiency and quality, we inaugurated 
our very own chilled distribution center to optimize delivery 
timelines and preserve the freshness to the stores. Building 
upon this success, we operate our ambient distribution  
center in 2023 to further empower our ability to deliver 
excellence across all fronts.
The variety of products and services available at 7-Eleven 
include bill payment services (TM, TNB, U Mobile, Syabas  
and Singer etc), sales of mobile phone reload, Touch ‘n Go  
card reload, Touch 'n Go eWallet reload, Razer Gold reload,

Pay, Alipay and Alipay+), and also payment using MyDebit, 
Visa or Master cards (local and foreign).
Bulletinboard for neighborhood community notices are also 
available.
The company’s first convenience outlets were known 
as Tote’m stores since customers “toted” away their 
purchases, and some even sported genuine Alaskan  
totem poles in front. In 1946, Tote’m became 7-Eleven 
to reflect the stores’ new, extended hours - 7 a.m. until 
11 p.m., seven days a week. The company’s corporate  
name was changed from The Southland Corporation to 
7-Eleven, Inc. in 1999.
We are the pioneer and the largest 24-hours  
convenience store operator in Malaysia. Upon achieving 
its 1,000 mark in stores network, 7-Eleven Malaysia 
opened its door to local entrepreneurs through its unique 
franchising program in 2009. We are the first franchisor  
in the local market to offer existing profit-making stores  
to franchisees. 
7-Eleven stores can be found across bustling  
commercial districts to serene suburban residential 
compounds throughout Malaysia, from petrol stations  
and LRT stations to shopping malls and medical 
institutions.

7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad 201301028701 (1058531-W)  •  Annual Report 2023
OVERVIEW
The year 2023, despite the pandemic 
being largely behind us, has been 
one defined by a confluence of global 
challenges; from the continuing threat 
of inflationary pressures and high-
profile global bank failures underscoring 
the fragility of the financial markets, 
to the on-going geopolitical tensions 
disrupting trade stability, were among 
factors that continued to test our 
collective resilience. In Malaysia, the 
newly-formed government embarked  
on a crucial journey towards post-
pandemic recovery, to drive long-term 
economic inclusivity and sustainable 
growth. This includes laying the 
groundwork for structural reforms 
aimed at enhancing the country's  
labour productivity and inclusive  
growth, specifically by raising the 
standard of living for low-income 
households.
Notwithstanding the myriad of 
challenges both on the global and 
local front, 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings 
Berhad ("SEM" or "the Group") was 
tenacious in the execution of our 
strategic plans and displayed a 
commitment to over-coming obstacles 
and seizing opportunities for growth. In 
this regard, for the financial year ending  
31 December 2023 (“FYE2023”), 
the Group achieved a remarkable  
milestone in delivering a record- 
breaking Revenue surpassing 
RM4.1billion, a significant increase 
of RM400.9 million or +10.6% as  
compared to the previous year. This 
revenue was primarily generated 
from our extensive store network of 
2,566 convenience stores and 267 
pharmaceutical outlets (Note: 250 in 
Malaysia and 17 in Indonesia).
During the year, we had also  
successfully divested our 
Pharmaceutical segment; at a 
valuation of RM900.0 million, we had 
recorded a corresponding gain on 
disposal of RM262.8 million.  This 
strategic divestment, which excludes 
the pharmaceutical business joint 
venture with PT. Erajaya Swasembada 
Tbk Group in Indonesia (“Indonesian 
Business”) to maintain a tactical foot-
print abroad, enabled us to unlock 
the value of our investment in Caring 
and focus our resources to grow our 
Convenience Stores segment which 
is expected to contribute positively to  
our Group’s future income.
Throughout this period, we remained 
committed to supporting our people, 
customers, and communities,  
prioritizing their safety and well-being.  
We are honoured to have been  
recognized for our efforts, receiving 
several awards, including our 7th 
consecutive win in the Sustainability 
& CSR Malaysia Awards 2023 for 
"Company of the Year Award (Retail 
Category)" and "Long-Standing 
Excellence in Sustainability," as well as 
accolades at the Putra Brand Awards 
2023: Retail Category, Silver Winner. 
In addition, we were also rewarded 
with 3 prestigious awards from the 
Asia-Pacific Enterprise Award (APEA) 
2023 and the icing to top it off, our  
CO-CEOs were honoured with the  
Master Entrepreneur Award, further 
validating our commitment to  
excellence and sustainability.
CONVENIENCE STORES SEGMENT
On the back of improved trading 
conditions and acceleration of our 
7CAFé format, the Convenience Stores 
segment recorded an all-time high 
Revenue of RM2,783.6 million, an 
increase of RM298.9 million or +12.0% 
as compared to the previous year. 
Essentially, we achieved overall higher 
productivity in terms of Customer  
count and Average per store day 
(“APSD”) sales, as compared to the 
previous year.
As the leading convenience store 
operator in Malaysia, we take pride 
in our commitment to delivering a 
personalized shopping experience to  
our customers across our extensive  
store network. 
Strategically, we expanded our 
footprint by opening 130 new 
stores, comprising 74 Classic  
stores and 56 7CAFé stores,  
strategically located in high-potential 
regions. Concurrently, we made the 
difficult decision to close 36 under-
performing stores, where declining 
trading levels rendered them 
economically unviable to operate.

7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad 201301028701 (1058531-W)  •  Annual Report 2023
As part of our strategy, we have 
refurbished 104 existing Classic 
stores into the 7CAFé format. This 
transformation initiative has been 
instrumental in enhancing the  
customer experience and driving 
footfall.  As a result, our network now 
boasts a total of 247 7CAFé stores,  
re-affirming our commitment to 
innovation and meeting evolving 
consumer preferences.
Our business strategy
• Improve assortment
• Supply chain
• Drive operational excellence
• Grow and improve store base
• Digitally enable the organization
• Engaging and developing our 
colleagues
Improve Assortment
In response to the dynamic retail 
landscape in Malaysia, we remain 
committed to modernizing, innovating, 
and offering unique products and 
services at our stores. Recognizing the 
phenomenon of "brand agnosticism" 
among today's consumers, who face 
a plethora of choices and have limited 
attention spans, our objective is clear: 
to captivate customers with fresh, 
personalized experiences and value-
added offerings.
In pursuit of this goal, FYE2023  
saw significant advancements in 
expanding our range of private label 
products, thereby providing consumers 
with a diverse array of value-added 
options. We actively introduced new 
and exclusive products, including 
premium imported goods and limited-
edition merchandise, through strategic 
collaborations with brand partners.  
Our aim is to continually excite and 
engage customers through innovative 
offerings that resonate with their 
evolving preferences.
Moreover, within the Fresh Food 
segment, we acknowledge the  
diversity of our customer base and 
strive to meet their varied needs. 
Collaborating with 7-Eleven Japan, 
our food commissary has integrated 
their expertise and best practices 
to craft fresh and innovative dishes. 
By incorporating seasonal local 
ingredients, we ensure that our  
offerings not only meet but exceed 
expectations, delivering exceptional 
freshness and flavour to our customers.
Supply Chain
Supply chain is the heart of our  
business and we continue to work on 
improving efficiencies and optimizing  
our logistical infrastructures. 
Throughout the year, we made  
significant strides in this regard, 
notably with the successful launch of 
our self-operated ambient distribution 
centre. Covering an area of 300,000 
square feet, this facility operates on 
a comprehensive inventory put-away 
model, complemented by automated 
handling activities. With increased 
efficiency in delivery lead times, on-
shelf availability, and picking accuracy, 
we anticipate better in-store service 
levels and customer experience.  We are  
equally pleased to share that our 
new fresh food commissary is 
already fully operational. Designed 
to accommodate up to 1,000 stores 
in the Klang Valley, this facility 
incorporates advanced equipment 
and automation to streamline key  
processes such as prepping, cooking, 
and packing, thereby enhancing the 
quality and consistency of our fresh 
food offerings.
We will continue to ensure consistent 
fulfilment to stores and to drive down 
cost alongside generating a fairer 
income. That said, we further recognise 
that additional infrastructure and 
facilities are required to fully support  
the expansion of our 7CAFé store  
format outside of Klang Valley; 
especially with time-sensitive 
Perishables and Fresh Food products 
being a key offering. We remain  
focused on this and will work towards 
our goal in the near future.
Drive Operational Excellence
Every day, we welcome over a million 
valued customers across all of our 
stores. Our customers are at the 
heart of everything we do, driving our 
relentless commitment to delivering 
exceptional service and ensuring a 
positive shopping experience for each 
individual.
To uphold our dedication to customer 
satisfaction, we have heavily invested 
in comprehensive customer service 
training programs. These initiatives 
equip our team members with the 
skills and knowledge needed to provide 
prompt and effective assistance, 
tailored to meet the diverse needs 
of our customers. Additionally, we 
actively monitor and assess our 
service standards through rigorous 
mystery shopper audits, allowing us 
to continuously refine and elevate the 
customer experience.
Cost efficiency is a key focus area 
for us, as we strive to eliminate 
unnecessary expenses such as bad 
costs and shrinkages, while optimizing 
resource utilization. We closely  
manage overtime expenditures, 
ensuring prudent allocation of labour 
resources without compromising on 
service quality.
Above all, our commitment to being 
"Always There For You" is reflected in 
our meticulous approach to staffing. 
We conduct thorough reviews to  
ensure that our stores are adequately 
staffed to cater to the needs of 
our customers at all times. By  
maintaining the right balance 
of personnel, we aim to provide  
attentive and personalized service  
that exceeds expectations, reinforcing 
our reputation as a trusted partner in 
our customers' shopping journeys.
Grow and Improve Store Base
We understand the significance of 
continuously expanding our store 
network to ensure accessibility 
for all customers, particularly in 
underrepresented areas. This year, we 
celebrated the significant milestone 
with the opening of our 100th 7CAFé 
format store, marking a testament to 
our commitment to innovation and 
customer satisfaction.
Furthermore, our expansion efforts 
have extended beyond the confines  
of the Klang Valley, reaching new 
territories in Terengganu, Johor, 
and Penang. By venturing into these  
regions, we aim to bridge gaps in 
accessibility and provide communities 
with convenient access to essential 
goods and services. This strategic 
expansion aligns with our mission 
to make 7-Eleven accessible to all, 
ensuring that customers across the 
nation can enjoy the convenience and 
quality they expect from our brand.

Digitally Enable the Organization
In today's rapidly evolving digital 
economy, success hinges not only 
on efficiency but also on business 
agility. It's imperative to swiftly seize 
opportunities while meeting the ever-
changing demands and expectations  
of our customers.
Throughout the year, we completed  
the installation of a store network 
upgrade, a pivotal step in streamlining 
our business processes. This upgrade 
has bolstered our real-time monitoring 
capabilities and seamlessly integrated 
with third-party quick commerce 
platforms, enhancing inventory 
management, cash collection 
processes, and cyber security 
measures.
Additionally, as part of our  
infrastructure enhancement initiatives, 
we invested in a cutting-edge 
warehouse management system 
(“WMS”) to seamlessly integrated end-
to-end supply chain processes and 
operations. This integration empowers 
us to harness the power of data  
analysis to monitor inventory levels, 
coordinate distribution and logistics, 
and make real-time stock adjustments. 
This dynamic system not only 
streamlines inventory management 
but also enhances stock replenishment 
processes, safeguarding against 
stock depletion and minimizing risks 
associated with damage and loss.
Engaging and Developing our 
Colleagues
To deliver exceptional experiences for 
our customers, we understand the 
fundamental importance of cultivating 
an exceptional work environment 
for our employees. Central to this  
approach is the implementation of  
robust learning and development 
initiatives tailored for our front-
line workers. These programs are 
meticulously designed to equip 
our employees with the necessary 
knowledge and skills to unlock their full 
potential and provide compassionate, 
outstanding service.
One such initiative is our  
comprehensive Store Training-New 
Modules program, which encompasses 
various essential components. 
From Objective Setting to Dedicated 
Store Trainer support and Post-
Action Planning, each element is 
geared towards fostering customer 
satisfaction. Through this structured 
training regimen, our employees are 
empowered to understand and meet 
the diverse needs of our clientele 
effectively.
Moreover, we prioritize ongoing  
training across various domains  
critical to customer service excellence. 
From product and food handling 
protocols to customer engagement 
strategies, upselling techniques, and 
promotion tracking, our employees 
receive continuous education to 
hone their skills. By investing in their 
development, we ensure that our team 
members are well-equipped to deliver 
consistently positive experiences 
for our customers, thus reinforcing 
our commitment to excellence and 
customer-centricity.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
Revenue
Revenue of the convenience store 
segment expanded by RM298.9  
million or +12.0% to RM2,783.6 
million, as compared to prior year of  
RM2,484.7 million. We achieved  
overall higher productivity in terms of 
Customer count and APSD sales, and 
we recorded a positive same-store-
sales growth (“SSSG”) of +9.1% as 
compared to the previous year. 
As at 31 December 2023, the total 
combined store count was 2,566  
stores, comprising 2,319 Classic  
Stores and 247 7CAFé.  During the 
year, we opened 74 new classic  
stores, 56 new 7CAFé and closed 
36 non-performing stores, for a net 
increase of 94 stores. On the other  
hand, we have also converted 104 
classic stores to 7CAFé format during 
the year.
Gross Profit
Gross Profit of the convenience store 
segment increased by RM66.8 million 
or 8.4% compared to the previous 
year, driven by the increase in Revenue 
and also improved margin as a result  
from lower contribution of tobacco 
offset by higher write off from 
perishables and fresh foods items.

7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad 201301028701 (1058531-W)  •  Annual Report 2023
Other Operating Income
Other Operating Income increased by 
RM18.9 million or 13.2% as compared 
to the previous year. The growth was 
primarily contributed by the increase  
in our marketing income.
Selling and Distribution Expenses
Selling and Distribution Expenses 
increased by RM90.3 million or 
14.0% year-on-year. This growth was 
primarily attributed to the escalated 
store operating expenses incurred as 
increased in store count, extended 
operating hours and impacted by 
annualisation of minimum wages 
increase effective 1st May 2022.
Administration and Other Operating 
Expenses
Administrative and Other Operating 
Expenses increased by RM38.7 million 
or 24.5% year-on-year. This was driven 
by mainly higher staff cost related 
expenses and advertising & promotional 
expenses.
Finance Cost
Finance Cost increased by RM5.4 
million or 9.0% year-on-year. This was 
driven mainly by the annualisation 
impact of interest expense from 
the issuance of Medium-Term Note  
(“MTN”) of RM100.0 million taken by 
the Group primarily for working capital 
purposes on June 2022 and higher 
finance cost from leased liabilities. 
Profit after Tax
The Profit after Tax for FYE2023 
surged by RM185.8 million or 220.4% 
to RM270.1 million as compared to 
prior year of RM84.3 million driven 
by improved performance from 
Convenience Stores segment and 
realised gain from the disposal of 
Caring Group.
Liquidity and Financial Resources
As at 31 December 2023, the Group 
retained a cash balance and short-  
term investment of RM799.5 million 
after cash dividend payment for 
financial year 2022 of RM59.9 million.
The Group has total borrowings of 
RM737.4 million as at 31 December 
2023. The borrowings comprise of 
bankers’ acceptance, revolving credit, 
term loan and medium term note  
which were utilized for corporate 
exercises, working capital and 
capital expenditures funding for new 
stores opening and including store 
refurbishments.  The debt-to-equity  
ratio (excluding the reorganisation 
deficit) of the Group as at 31 December 
2023 was 0.43 times, which is in 
compliance with all existing loan 
covenant obligations. Operating 
cash flows generated at the end of  
financial year 2023 was RM257.0 
million.
PROSPECTS
Outlook for 2024
Looking ahead, despite headwinds 
on the external front, Malaysia is 
poised for sustained economic 
growth in 2024; supported by resilient 
domestic demand, which constitutes a  
significant portion of the economy,  
and a recovery in exports. Private 
consumption will remain a primary 
growth driver, anchored by favourable 
labour market conditions and 
increasing employment opportunities. 
The expected revival in the 
tourism sector, particularly with  
the introduction of visa-free entry 
for tourists from China and India, is 
anticipated to provide a substantial 
boost locally. 
The government’s budget for 2024, 
outlined key measures such as an 
increase in the Sales and Services Tax 
to 8% and rationalisation of subsidies, 
which may dampen consumer 
sentiment in the near term. That said, 
from a macro-economic perspective, 
the government had forecasted a  
Gross Domestic Product growth of 
between 4% to 5% for 2024, under-
pinned by the strategic initiatives under 
the Madani Economy Framework, 
including value accretive developments 
and flagship projects outlined in the  
(a) 12th Malaysia Plan Mid-Term 
Review; (b) New Energy Transition 
Roadmap; and (c) New Industrial  
Master Plan 2030; all of which are 
expected to catalyse Malaysia’s 
economic agenda.
In the coming year, we will continue to 
focus on expanding our new 7CAFé 
store format in the peninsular Malaysia; 
also, to constantly innovate and 
refresh our fresh food menu of ready 
to go (“RTG”) and made to go (“MTG”) 
meals, incorporating clean and healthy 
ingredients with greater nutritional 
value. Equally vital, is the mission to 
grow our private label offerings as we 
seek to continuously deliver value to 
the emerging group of modern, brand 
agnostic consumer, where the focus 
solely on brand per-se is gradually 
vanishing in favour of a focus on the 
product itself and its attributes.  
Additionally, we will continue our 
advisory mission with our Japanese 
partner, to focus on expanding our 
fresh food commissary offerings 
and improving production yield by  
optimising high quality raw materials, 
adopting best operational practices 
and discipline. We also have plans in 
the current year to introduce our My7E 
Online Store, offering on-demand 
delivery to our customers through 
our My7E Mobile App platform. And 
to enhance our supply chain planning 
and efficiency, we plan to implement 
a Transport Management System, 
coupled with Digital E-Proof-of- 
Delivery, both of which are anticipated 
to simplify logistical operations across 
the value chain. Last but not least, 
in line with our customer-centric 
strategy, we will be conducting more 
regular consumer research and 
insights, leveraging the voice of the 
consumer through social listening and 
brand health studies to continuously  
improve our services and product 
offerings
With regards to the Indonesian 
Business, we will collaborate closely 
with our joint venture partner with 
an immediate focus on the overall  
strategic roadmap, including store 
expansion plans, product range and 
pricing review, marketing activation  
and driving a consumer centric 
operation. 
Finally, the Board of Directors extends  
its sincere gratitude to our  
shareholders for their unwavering 
support throughout the years.  In 
particular, to the Management and 
employees of 7-Eleven for their 
resilience, dedication and loyalty; and  
in serving our customers with the 
utmost care and professionalism, our 
sincere thanks to you all.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY AND FRAMEWORK
SEM's robust sustainability strategy, centred on "People", "Planet", and "Product", aligns seamlessly with Bursa Malaysia's 
sustainability guideline pillars of "Economic", "Environment", and "Social", ensuring a holistic approach to sustainable  
business practices.
PRODUCT
We are committed to addressing  
economic considerations. Prioritising  
eco-friendly packaging materials initially 
for our private label products and favouring 
recyclable and reusable materials helps us 
minimise our environmental impact. We are 
establishing sustainable sourcing practices 
in collaboration with key stakeholders.
PEOPLE
Our comprehensive training 
programmes equip employees with 
the skills and knowledge for an 
empowered workplace. We do not 
tolerate discrimination and resolutely 
follow fair and inclusive practices. 
We also invite our employees to 
participate in our Corporate Social 
Responsibility ("CSR") activities. 
PLANET
We pioneer initiatives that 
significantly	and	positively	reduce	
our environmental impact, such as 
prioritising energy conservation, 
minimising our carbon footprint and 
implementing	efficient	food	utilisation	
and waste management practices.
SEM's sustainability efforts have progressed significantly this year, with the Group initiating target setting in key areas,  
assessing impact, and aligning with global objectives such as TCFD, decarbonisation, achieving net zero emissions,  
promoting supply chain sustainability, and supporting the UNSDGs. SEM will report its performance against these targets  
in future reports.

SUSTAINABILITY RISK MANAGEMENT: EMBRACING A HOLISTIC APPROACH
SEM embraces a comprehensive approach, integrating sustainability into risk management following global best practices. 
Collaboration between sustainability and risk management teams helps identify, assess and mitigate environmental, social, and 
governance ("ESG") risks. Sustainability is also strategically woven into investment decisions, evaluating capital ("CAPEX") and 
operational ("OPEX") expenditures. Aligning financial decisions with long-term sustainability goals reinforces our commitment 
to responsible practices with positive societal and environmental impacts.
ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU: EMPOWERING CONNECTION THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We embody our commitment to being "Always There for You." Viewing stakeholders as vital partners and prioritising open 
communication and collaboration ensures that stakeholders are supported and heard so they can actively contribute to 
shaping our sustainable initiatives.
In line with the principle that "Caring is Our Profession”, we prioritise the well-being of our stakeholders. We actively listen, value 
feedback, and engage stakeholders transparently and inclusively. This approach builds enduring relationships, showcasing our 
commitment to caring for stakeholders and the communities we serve.
SEM SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE
The Board is primarily responsible for seamlessly integrating sustainability into operations, with assistance from the Risk 
Management & Sustainability Committee ("RMSC"). Ultimately, the Board is accountable for overseeing Group sustainability 
matters, including but not limited to sustainability strategy and targets, materiality assessments and climate-related risks and 
opportunities. 
The Sustainability Working Group ("SWG"), comprising representatives from diverse divisions, leads the execution of 
sustainability. The SWG conducts risk analyses and presents action plans, new initiatives and budget proposals to the  
Board. This comprehensive approach is reinforced by dedicated sustainability units within our convenience store and 
pharmaceutical arms, ensuring a cohesive and effective sustainability management framework. The Board receives  
quarterly updates on targets, performance metrics, progress and the scorecard, allowing for comprehensive assessment  
and strategic decision-making.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING MATERIALITY IN OUR OPERATIONS
SEM systematically undertakes an annual materiality assessment, strategically engaging internal and external stakeholders. 
This proactive approach prioritises and addresses critical issues affecting stakeholders and the business. Meticulously 
evaluating the repercussions on various stakeholders and the company helps us enhance transparency throughout  
operations.
This process ensures that our precisely tailored sustainability initiatives address the most pressing concerns, aligning our  
efforts with the paramount aspects of our business and societal impact. Employing this methodical approach fosters 
transparency and helps us to make informed decisions that contribute to the organisation's long-term success and  
sustainability.
THE METHODOLOGY
During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2023, SEM engaged Ace CSR Sdn Bhd to conduct a materiality assessment,  
ensuring the confidentiality of respondents. A survey was administered to stakeholders, soliciting their evaluations on 
the significance of 15 sustainability areas. The respondents used a 5-point Likert Symmetric Scale, ranging from "very  
unimportant" (1) to "very important" (5), with a midpoint of (3) denoting neutrality. The Board and Senior Management  
Team actively participated, contributing valuable insights to SEM's comprehensive understanding.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY
The economic sustainability of the retail and pharmaceutical industry relies on efficient supply chains, competitive 
pricing strategies and adaptability to evolving retail and healthcare landscapes. Investments in technology, streamlined  
distribution networks and environmentally conscious practices contribute to long-term viability. This approach achieves 
economic goals and contributes positively to societal well-being. 
SUSTAINABLE VALUE CHAIN
SEM inculcates sustainability throughout its complex value chain, incorporating best practices into policies and processes. 
The Group achieves a sustainable supply chain through responsible decision-making in collaboration with supplier partners, 
material procurement and the transport or logistics teams. 
SEM incorporates suppliers’ sustainability initiatives in the tendering process for new suppliers and conducts a thorough 
sustainability review of existing strategic partners. The procurement and sustainability units track progress towards  
established objectives. 
SUSTAINABILITY DEMANDS ON SUPPLIERS
Ensuring sustainability across operations is a top priority. Enforcing strict sustainability guidelines in our Suppliers Code of 
Conduct (“SCC”) ensures suppliers meet their respective environmental and social responsibilities. All suppliers must comply 
with our sustainability requirements in their operations, including environmental and social work demands, as set out in our 
Vendor Code of Conduct. Communicating these guidelines in a language suppliers understand also boosts compliance. 
Close collaboration with suppliers and aligning their practices with our sustainability standards fosters a responsible  
supply chain. Long-term partnerships are pivotal in shaping SEM’s strategy for a sustainable supply chain. We engage with 
suppliers to exchange ideas and collectively address industry-wide environmental and social issues. Within our Vendor  
Code of Conduct, we emphasise environmental consciousness and workplace safety, urging suppliers to operate  
sustainably and prioritise the well-being of their employees. SEM Vendor Code of Conduct consists of five main principles.
Five Main Principles of SEM’s Vendor Code of Conduct
Engaging with major suppliers increases their understanding of social and environmental responsibilities. These sessions 
function as forums for exchanging best practices derived from a diverse array of industry leaders. The goal is collective 
development, enabling us to tackle widespread environmental and social risks across the industry in unison.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPLY CHAIN
The Group is committed to its supplier sourcing assessment processes, which include social and environmental elements 
such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water conservation within the value chain and compliance with  
the applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Elements of Our Supplier Sourcing Assessment Processes
We integrated environmental policies into the Group’s supply chain process. More importantly, we have communicated our 
goals and expectations to major suppliers through formal meetings and regular engagement, such as conducting training  
and workshops for relevant supplier staff.
Potential or new suppliers are subject to an environmental risk assessment as part of our due diligence to ensure  
compliance with our environmental standards. SEM conducts similar risk assessments for existing suppliers, especially 
those high-risk environmentally, and ad-hoc and planned periodic supplier reviews. The Group visits its suppliers regularly  
and discovered no significant cases of non-compliance in FY2023.
We will continue to mitigate environmental impacts in our supply chain by participating and collaborating in workshops and 
industry and topic-specific initiatives. Our membership in various relevant organisations, such as the CEO Action Network 
(“CAN”), addresses industry and topic-specific environmental sustainability in the supply chain initiatives.
We invite suppliers to join us on our green journey and encourage them to monitor, record, report and share their  
environmental performance and impact reduction. We share our knowledge with suppliers, provide tools to evaluate their 
environmental footprint, define suitable improvement activities and reward progress and proactivity. Suppliers are also 
encouraged to minimise their impact on biodiversity and pollution and practise resource waste reduction. 
SEM commits to adopting green technology, where feasible, across its supply chain to track GHG emissions and energy  
use at its operations. Collaborating with suppliers, SEM reviews packaging materials and maintains an in-house database 
with built-in sustainability metrics for continuous improvement projects across the supplier portfolio. As a part of our  
ongoing initiatives to enhance supply chain efficiency, our pharmaceutical division is implementing a strategic decision  
to bring back e-store fulfilment to our Central Distribution Centre (“CDC”). This move addresses challenges associated  
with slow-moving or non-moving stock in third-party warehouses.
SOCIAL SUPPLY CHAIN
Social responsibility in a supply chain concerns suppliers protecting and fairly treating those working indirectly. Major  
supply chain partners must adhere to all social standards stipulated by Malaysian Labour Law and the International  
Labour Organisation (“ILO”). The Group’s formal Ethical Code of Conduct for suppliers includes terms to ensure suppliers  
treat their workers fairly.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
LOCALLY GROWN, LOCALLY LOVED
SEM’s commitment to local hiring is a cornerstone of its corporate ethos, driven by the belief in empowering and nurturing  
local talent. This multifaceted commitment encompasses several key strategies to ensure equitable opportunities and  
foster the growth of the local workforce.
SEM Local Procurement Strategies
Equal Opportunity for Local Talent
• We source our products and services locally whenever possible and practicable. We also prioritise local suppliers and  
SMEs at our events, for partnerships or collaborations for growing our range of private labels or own-brand products. 
Targeted Local Advertising
• SEM strategically utilises several platforms to attract local talent, such as highlighting positions on its career page,  
partnering with local online job portals, distributing community flyers and displaying banners in prominent local areas.  
This localised approach maximises visibility among local talent pools.
Skill-Based Hiring with Local Preference
• SEM prioritises the skills and experience required for the job during hiring. Preferring local talents supports the Group's 
commitment to supporting and uplifting the community through employment opportunities.
Partnerships for Enhanced Outreach
• SEM collaborates with local educational institutions and government agencies such as PERKESO, HRDF and state 
governments. This collaboration identifies talent, initiates skills development programmes and fosters a stronger  
connection with the local talent ecosystem.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
• SEM attracts and retains top local talent by offering competitive remuneration packages. The Group's comprehensive 
benefits programme includes healthcare, retirement plans and various perks that ensure employees' well-being and 
satisfaction.
Supportive Work Environment
• Recognising the potential difficulties certain employees face, SEM provides comfortable accommodation for those in  
need and complimentary transportation services. This dedication lets employees concentrate on their responsibilities,  
free from housing or commuting worries.
UPHOLDING ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE
SEM upholds the highest standards of ethics and integrity to prevent unethical conduct. Our Code of Conduct and  
Business Ethics (“CCBE”) outlines proper business practices with a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption, including  
bribery, kickbacks, fraud and money laundering.
All board members and employees fully embrace and adhere to the CCBE and the ABAC. They undergo specific training  
aligned with these policies to ensure comprehensive compliance.
The ABAC publicly communicates our unwavering stance against bribery and corruption. Our subsidiaries’ Board of  
Directors endorsed this policy, complying with relevant regulations.

UPHOLDING ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE (CONT'D)
We communicate the ABAC policy to employees during orientation, publish relevant policies on our website and distribute  
them to all employees and business partners. Employees must demonstrate their understanding and commitment to anti-
corruption through regular training. Strict disciplinary measures, including termination, are enforced against those who  
violate the policy. SEM’s employees, subsidiaries, newly appointed service providers and vendors must sign an Integrity 
Declaration Form.
Throughout the year, SEM delivered multiple ABAC training sessions, including three sessions specifically for Store  
Support Centre (“SSC”) colleagues and ten sessions for store colleagues.
Our ABAC and No-Gift Policy establish ethical standards for our employees, suppliers and business partners, prohibiting 
corruption and bribery. Before this year’s festive seasons, we issued ABAC guidelines reminders, explicitly emphasising the 
need for gift declaration. Contractors and suppliers must also follow these rules; failure to comply may result in contract 
termination. 
Identifying corruption risks in our risk register helps us design effective mitigation strategies and deploy resources to  
combat bribery, corruption and fraud. All contractors, subcontractors, intermediaries and third parties undergo corruption  
and bribery risk assessments, declaring their non-involvement in misconduct or illegal behaviour. Comprehensive  
screening of business partners for corruption and bribery aligns with our compliance requirements.
SEM offers a Whistleblowing Channel for secure and anonymous reporting of non-compliance. We encourage individuals 
to take responsibility for reporting misconduct, such as bullying or harassment, using the channels described in the Fit  
and Proper Policy on our corporate website. Trained officers are responsible for handling reported incidents, including  
bullying, harassment, bribery, financial irregularities and other offences within the company.
•	 Bribery	is	commonly	defined	as	the	offering,	promising,	giving,	accepting	or	soliciting	
of an advantage as an inducement for an action which is illegal, unethical or a breach 
of trust. Inducements can be gifts, loans, fees, rewards or other advantages (taxes, 
services, donations or favours). 
Bribery
Corruption •	 Corruption	is	commonly	defined	as	an	act	to	gain	an	advantage	inconsistent	with	official	
duty and the rights of others. 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Conflicts of interest, though not inherently prohibited in bribery and corruption laws, heighten the risk of corrupt practices. 
SEM promotes transparency by requiring prompt disclosure of conflicts, even if specific guidelines are not explicitly outlined. 
Individuals must refrain from decision-making related to conflicts of interest, as mandated by both SEM’s policies and  
legal regulations.
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS
SEM adopts a practice of non-affiliation with any political entity and strictly prohibits making political contributions or  
favours on its behalf. While employees, directors, and business associates may make personal political donations, they  
must make these contributions independently and not be associated with SEM.

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
SEM strongly advocates for environmental sustainability, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to green practices. 
Incorporating eco-friendly policies into supply chains, involving suppliers in green initiatives, and conducting thorough risk 
assessments help SEM achieve a harmonious balance between business success and responsible environmental stewardship. 
This commitment ensures a future built on sustainable practices.
The Group has recently formalised its Environmental Policy, which sets out fundamental principles, including:
• Compliance with environmental laws and regulations
• Conservation of energy and other resources
• Climate change management
• Waste minimisation
• Responsible procurement
• Environmental education and awareness
• Environmental management and procedures
ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT
We commit to reducing energy use and minimising environmental impact through continuous assessment, innovation and 
efficient practices. Carefully considering processes, materials and technologies optimises resources, reduces waste and 
improves overall efficiency.
Addressing climate change is a paramount global challenge. SEM acknowledges the significance of minimising emissions 
across its extended supply chain and recognises climate change’s destructive consequences and short- and long-term  
business risks. The Group’s unwavering dedication to tackling this issue involves enhancing operational efficiencies to  
avoid the impact of climate change and improve efficiency.
The SWG and Sustainability Units, overseen by the RMSC, devise strategies to manage and decrease our environmental 
footprint efficiently. During quarterly meetings, the Board is briefed on their progress and upcoming plans.
Our climate change strategy includes working with employees and supply chain partners on energy-saving systems and a 
climate change risk assessment.
SEM promotes energy conservation and climate change through adaptation, including enhancing energy efficiency in lighting, 
ovens and freezers. Our commitment is evident because 100% of our store lighting utilises energy-saving LED and induction 
lights. We spent RM1.0 million on this upgrading work. 
All new air-conditioning units boast a minimum three (3), preferably four (4)-star rating, highlighting their power efficiency. 
Embracing technological innovation and implementing energy-efficient enhancements remain integral to our approach. As 
part of our commitment to addressing climate change and enhancing efficiency, we actively incorporate new and green 
technologies where feasible throughout our supply chain. Specifically, we have implemented a tracking system to monitor 
operational greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption.
SEM integrated climate-related risk management into the Group-wide risk scorecard. It is part of the foundation for  
formulating the business strategy and selecting future R&D and technological investments. Specifically, SEM’s climate risk 
management process includes mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions and climate engineering. We integrate 
climate-related risks and opportunities into the Group’s strategy, especially when designing new processes, R&D, sourcing 
strategy and mitigation plans. 
Climate change affects operating costs (“OPEX”) and capital expenditures (“CAPEX”). Our stores’ efficiency, output 
and performance can decrease due to changing climate conditions. Further, CAPEX could increase due to premature  
replacements or repairs, and OPEX might also rise due to the increased need for congestion management.
GOAL
To install energy-saving 
equipment in 100% of  
our stores by 2030

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
We work closely with regulators and regularly consult on ways to address challenges brought by climate change, such as  
through public policy implementation. The Group shapes public policy and regulations, with our Pharmaceutical Division 
being a CEO Action Network (“CAN”) member. This closed-door peer-to-peer informal network of CEOs of leading Malaysian 
businesses focuses on sustainability advocacy, capacity building, action and performance. Members meet regularly to 
discuss growing business challenges: accelerating climate change and the climate emergency, increasing social injustices  
and corporate governance failures. Our role and involvement in this membership include:
• Identifying pressing environmental issues in climate change, water and waste
• Collaborating on solutions that drive improvement within SEM and throughout the value chain
We continue to ensure consistency between our climate change policy and the position we advocate at trade associations  
of which we are members. We commit to responding appropriately during conflicts of opinion by identifying gaps and  
initiating a process that alerts the Group to new areas of development and industry best practices.
SEM is committed to being a part of tackling the climate change problem, emphasising reducing GHG emissions in the  
following areas:
Carbon Footprint Scopes What We Do
Direct energy consumption within the 
organisation (scope 1)
Monitoring and recording the company vehicles’ petrol and diesel use

SCOPE 3: EMPLOYEES’ DAILY COMMUTE TO WORK
Significant CO 2 emissions result from employees travelling to and from work. In 2023, SEM estimated the total annual  
emissions produced by our entire workforce’s daily commute. SEM tracks these emissions annually.
METHODOLOGY
During the last quarter of 2023, SEM launched a survey to ascertain employees' typical travel methods, approximate total 
daily distance travelled, and the type, age, engine size and fuel used if employees used their vehicles. All employees were  
encouraged to respond.
A Mobile Combustion GHG Emissions Calculation Tool from the GHG Protocol Initiative helped calculate the emissions of  
each respondent. SEM estimates these annual emissions based on employees working an average of 242 days annually.

CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Climate change risks include changes in the global climate system, region-specific regulatory reinforcement, market trends, 
stakeholder needs and changing physical environment.
In the short term, SEM recognises extreme weather events and the need for high-efficiency technologies as potential risks  
while viewing reduced energy costs as immediate opportunities. Mid-term prospects involve anticipating changing  
consumption patterns and embracing expanded renewable energy use. Looking ahead in the long term, the company  
perceives physical impacts like climate change as risks. SEM adopts response measures for long-term risks in line with 
emissions mitigation plans guided by the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ("IPCC")  
emissions scenarios, and the International Energy Agency's ("IEA") Energy Technology Perspectives.
SEM has seamlessly incorporated the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") framework into its 
sustainability disclosure and climate change management, meticulously assessing risks stemming from climate change  
across all upstream and downstream activities in the value chain. The company vigilantly monitors and addresses these 
identified risks.
Governance The Board of Directors oversees SEM's initiatives to identify, assess and integrate climate-related risks 
and opportunities and progress toward goals and targets throughout the organisation. The RMSC 
meets quarterly to discuss climate-related issues and other sustainability matters, which it brings to 
the Board’s attention for discussion, review or approval as appropriate. 
Strategy SEM has conducted several discussions with internal stakeholders across operations to identify  
climate risks relevant to the Group. The Group currently addresses climate-related risks and 
opportunities, focusing on assessed physical and transition risks and opportunities. This initiative 
considers significant increases in the global average temperature and the ambitious pathway  
towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Based on these 
scenarios, we will integrate these considerations into our financial planning, aligning them with our 
formulated adaptation and mitigation plans.
Risk management All identified risks, including climate-related ones, are strategically assessed and managed through  
our risk management process, which we have integrated into the Group's Enterprise Risk  
Management ("ERM") framework.

Metrics and 
targets
All our carbon emission data adhere to the methodologies outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard. SEM is actively working to formalise its climate-related  
performance metrics and tracking. As part of our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality, SEM 
is developing climate-related targets associated with GHG emissions, energy consumption, water 
consumption and waste generation.
SEM CROSS DOCK SYSTEM
SEM implements the 7E Cross Dock System to optimise its supply chain and reduce its environmental impact. This system 
involves suppliers delivering products to our Centralised Distribution Centres ("CDC"), where goods are consolidated 
before moving to regional cross-dock hubs for separation and delivery to stores. Eliminating individual supplier trips to 
stores nationwide helps reduce CO 2 emissions significantly, cutting the frequency of trips by 80%. This efficient process  
emphasises SEM's commitment to sustainability and operational excellence.
Despite our growing store base, we aim to lower both diesel consumption and CO 2 emissions each year, as shown below:
Year Diesel consumption: savings

GROWING WITH OUR PEOPLE 
SEM prioritises its employees, exemplifying its commitment to safety, growth and development. Our dedication extends 
to fostering an engaging and professional atmosphere, allowing our team to contribute meaningfully to the fast-paced and 
demanding environments of the retail and pharmaceutical sectors.
A comprehensive CCBE guides our strong belief in conducting ethical operations. The Group's CCBE lists fair employment 
standards and practices. We communicate our labour standards stance to all employees in English as it is the most  
commonly used business language. This document is translated into other languages, including Bahasa Malaysia, when 
necessary.
Periodically, we participate in workshops or industry/topic-specific collaboration projects that provide industry solutions  
that improve labour standards in Malaysia. As part of our risk assessment procedure, we regularly review the labour  
standards of existing operations and potential business and supply chain partners as part of due diligence. We familiarise 
all parties with our CCBE from time to time. SEM also supports the United Nations Global Compact, which addresses  
labour standards and human rights. There were no instances of non-compliance with labour standards during this  
reporting period.
INCLUSIVE CULTURE
SEM fosters inclusivity and diversity within the organisation. We champion equal opportunities for all, creating an environment 
that respects and values every individual. Discrimination based on race, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, disabilities,  
or nationality has no place within SEM. 
EQUALITY IN HIRING, PAY AND PROMOTION
SEM adheres to local labour laws during recruitment, preferring hiring locally. However, diverse talent and expertise are vital 
for our ever-expanding international customer base. When these talents and expertise are unavailable locally, we source 
internationally. 
We implement diverse programmes to promote local hiring. In our pharmaceutical division, the Referral Incentive  
Programme encourages employees to recommend talented individuals interested in joining the team. Fair employment  
practices actively tackle youth unemployment in Malaysia by advocating for the inclusion of underprivileged groups, 
encompassing individuals from deprived backgrounds and those with limited formal education or qualifications. We firmly 
adhere to the principle of 'equal pay for equal work,' ensuring compliance with all local laws. We observe the principle  
of equal remuneration for work of equal value in establishing wage structures.
EXPANDING HORIZONS IN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES
SEM has undertaken several initiatives to provide employment opportunities, bolster capacity building, address youth 
unemployment and support talent development.
Comprehensive personal development training for employees enhances skills, fosters leadership qualities and promotes  
well-being. These initiatives include communication skills, time management, emotional intelligence and resilience  
workshops.

MEASURING WORKPLACE EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION
In February 2023, our Convenience Store division conducted an extensive employee engagement survey utilising NPS 
methodology. The survey encompassed various engagement drivers, including career development, leadership, physical 
workplace conditions, pay and benefits, targeting employees from the SSC to Store Managers. The survey achieved a  
response rate of 68%. We analysed the results at organisational and departmental levels, categorised by employees' years of 
service and job levels. Sharing these reports with department heads and Co-CEOs provided actionable insights to enhance 
employee satisfaction and engagement.
Overall, employees highlighted a positive co-working relationship among their team members and supportive leaders 
and colleagues who help them achieve their goals. Employees also expressed pride in working for a brand well-known by 
many people and reported satisfaction with their work-life balance. Some feedback included concerns about insufficient  
headcount leading to increased workload, inefficiencies in specific work areas, and recommendations for the Group to  
review salary and career growth opportunities.
The Group considered all feedback and is improving its performance in each area, including exploring talent management 
systems and streamlining and automating work processes.
MANAGING GRIEVANCES
SEM maintains a systematic approach to grievance management, prioritising employee engagement and a harmonious 
workplace. In 2023, we received and successfully resolved 96 grievance reports. The resolution process involves gathering 
comprehensive information, constructing timelines and facilitating clarifications through inquiries or investigations led  
by the employee's superior. We provide regular updates to the complainant throughout the process.
EMPOWERING, CELEBRATING AND ELEVATING WOMEN
SEM's commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment is deeply rooted in organisational values. We actively 
championed initiatives supporting women across various aspects of life throughout the year, offering career development 
training and specific benefits such as flexible working hours.
Our commemoration of International Women's Day involved hosting a compelling panel discussion titled 'Embracing Equity: 
Let's Stay Inclusive.' This discussion delved into gender equality nuances, strategies for inclusivity and dismantling societal 
biases. Implementing actionable measures fosters an inclusive workplace culture.
We motivated employees to break from their usual work schedules and volunteer for a women's shelter aiding trafficked 
refugees in line with our commitment to diversity and encapsulating our ethos reflected in #alwaysthereforyou. The volunteers 
painted the shelter, engaged compassionately with the female residents and created a DIY recycling area. This meaningful 
experience fostered a culture of volunteerism and social responsibility.

STORE SAFETY
Convenience stores and the pharmaceutical industry face various concealed business risks, ranging from workplace safety 
guidelines to consumer privacy regulations, which could lead to significant costs. Convenience store employees, especially 
those working late-night shifts, are exposed to multiple safety hazards. Consequently, we have implemented explicit  
operating procedures for night shift operations, prioritising employees' safety and well-being.
TALENT DEVELOPMENT
SEM delivered robust training and development initiatives to enhance employee skills across different levels. Specialised 
training sessions, including MS Excel Advanced, Amazing Macro, and Data Visualization, targeted technical proficiency and 
data analysis capabilities.
Comprehensive, on-the-job store-level training programmes explicitly catered to new employees and managers, facilitating 
their smooth integration into their roles. Providing specialised training for field managers and food handlers ensures  
operational efficiency and compliance with safety standards.
SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning is a crucial strategy for SEM's continual growth and resilience. The Group consistently refines its 
performance management system by involving high-performing employees in defining key performance indicators and 
readying them for greater organisational responsibilities.
Through a meticulous process, 43 candidates emerged as successors for pivotal roles across the organisation. A talent 
assessment categorised employees based on different potential levels. We presented this assessment to the Co-CEOs for 
further evaluation and strategic alignment.
This succession planning initiative facilitated the smooth transition of several critical roles to identified successors,  
including positions such as Senior Manager in People & Culture and Manager in Store Learning & Development. This  
proactive approach to talent identification and development underscores SEM's commitment to nurturing internal talent, 
ensuring a robust leadership pipeline and fortifying the organisation for future growth and adaptability.
INTERNSHIP AND PLACEMENTS
The Pharmaceutical segment runs a one-year Provisionally Registered Pharmacist ("PRP") and a three-month Marketing, 
E-commerce Apprenticeship Programme with local universities. In FY2023, 21 pharmaceutical graduates participated 
in the PRP programme, with 13 completing it. The graduates gained regulated hands-on experience and became  
competent registered pharmacists. Qualified candidates are offered one-year fixed-term contracts post-PRP training as  
Fully Registered Pharmacists (“FRP”) serving in our stores.
BUILDING A STRONGER COMMUNITY TOGETHER
SEM is deeply committed to community well-being, embodying the pledge to "Always There for You" and embracing the  
ethos that "Caring Is Our Profession." Innovative programmes help shape a thriving society. Seamlessly aligning our  
community initiatives with our business strategy positively impacts all communities we serve. Our community investments 
prioritise focus areas such as community development, education, enrichment and health. Linking our community  
investments with the Company's business strategy delivers a holistic and sustainable impact.
In FY2023, the Group's social investment and support initiatives helped communities, non-profit organisations and the 
vulnerable, contributing RM5.1 million to non-profit organisations.

RECOGNISING VOLUNTEERISM
SEM highly values volunteerism and continually encourages employees to engage in philanthropic programmes. Throughout 
the year, SEM organised several CSR activities to support good causes, including:
• International Women's Day (“IWD”) Women's Shelter Visit
• The SSC Blood Donation Drive, which donated 105 blood packs to the blood bank

Including these CSR activities in employees' year-end performance appraisals recognises employees' involvement.  
Participating in at least one CSR activity unlocks a 10% section on Core Value KPIs and improves the overall score. This  
initiative incentivises and acknowledges employees' dedication to social responsibility and volunteerism.
Our pharmaceutical division also actively engages in outreach programmes. Encouraging employees to participate  
fosters a culture of volunteerism and community impact. These initiatives include visits to old folks' homes and other local 
community awareness activities, demonstrating our commitment to making a positive difference in the communities we  
serve.
RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS
We uphold human rights across all operations and the extended value chain, conducting business ethically and sustainably. 
Our practices align with international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the  
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Bill of Human Rights.
We also strictly abide by applicable employment and human rights laws in our operating regions. The CCBE summarises  
our human rights criteria. All associates review and receive annual awareness briefings on this Code as part of the  
training on human rights policy. These documents are available in English and Bahasa Malaysia. 
The Group is committed to aligning its conduct with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  
We also allocated day-to-day responsibilities and functions to monitor human rights compliance.
SEM has recently formalised its Human Rights Policy, which promotes the human rights of its stakeholders, including  
employees, business partners, suppliers, customers and communities. The Policy addresses implementing the following 
principles across our workplace, operations and value chain.

OPERATING RESPONSIBILY
We prioritise the safety and well-being of our customers in managing a diverse array of convenience store products and 
pharmaceutical goods. Recognising the potential harm associated with mishandling certain foods, drugs, and stocked items, 
we have established stringent in-house management standards. 
We must ensure that safety standards specific to each product type are meticulously maintained. As we expand our food 
service offerings, mitigating food safety risks becomes even more critical. Guided by local and international standards,  
we implement an overarching system that meticulously controls every step of the product life-cycle process. This  
comprehensive approach upholds the highest levels of product quality and safety, aligning with our commitment to  
responsible operations in the convenience store retail and pharmaceutical industry.
CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY
Customer trust is vital; we take full responsibility for protecting their privacy by raising awareness of privacy and  
cybersecurity through our intranet and website. Specific teams dealing with personal data, including vendor management, 
engineering, human resources, and legal, receive focused guidance. 
We strictly adhere to stringent data governance, monitoring access through audit logs. Our vendors are diligently working 
towards ISO 27001 compliance. In the first quarter of 2023, the 7E IT team performed penetration testing on the My7E 2.0 
mobile app to ensure the robust security of customer data.
QUALITY MANAGEMENT

Supplier Management Programme, which:
• Incorporates Product Management and Surveillance Management
• Guarantees all items launched under the 7-Eleven brand comply with regulations, quality benchmarks and safety 
prerequisites
• Sustains consumer trust
Supplier audits evaluate compliance with the 7E Food Manufacturing Standard based on the GFSI scheme standard. In 2023, 
we audited 22 suppliers as scheduled, noting no noteworthy deviations from compliance. 
Each store practises strict rules, including:
• Checking the condition of all foods and packaging on receipt for damage, contamination risks, pests, quality and expiry 
dates
• Rejecting deliveries if significant damage risks contamination, infestation or expired products
• Ensuring hot counters are 60°C and above at all times as per the local Government's temperature control requirements

• Specialised training such as Food Safety and Audit Skills Workshops
• Participation in Shadow and Witness Audits
• Annual calibration sessions to maintain compliance
A dedicated quality assurance team also conducts a yearly Q-FoS Audit, reviewing 1,542 stores in 2023.
The audit team reviews and validates 7E Q-FoS compliance at stores, including planning, auditing, monitoring and corrective 
actions. We delivered 20 7E Q-FoS training sessions for 457 store managers during the year. 
A quality assurance team carries out an annual Q-FoS Audit. This team meticulously assesses and verifies compliance

CUSTOMER-DRIVEN EFFICIENCY: MAXIMISING MOMENTUM FOR SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE
SELF-MANAGED DISTRIBUTION CENTRE  
SEM has established its self-managed Distribution Centre (“DC”), introducing a new operational environment within its 
warehouse and distribution network. This initiative represents a shift from the previous flow-through inventory model to a 
putaway and storage approach, enabling SEM to improve inventory availability.
The transition to this model revolutionises stock availability in stores, ensuring a more robust inventory supply chain. With 
the majority of inventory being put away and stored, SEM can manage and control stock levels more effectively, leading to 
improved availability of products at stores.
This shift facilitates a notable enhancement in delivery frequency, reducing the time from order placement to delivery 
(T+2). Streamlining inventory management and adopting a more efficient storage strategy expedites delivery timelines and  
promptly meets customer demands.
Introducing a Warehouse Management System (“WMS”) within SEM’s self-managed DC is a transformative step. This  
integration delivers real-time inventory updates and transparent monitoring, significantly improving the warehouse’s  
operational flow. The WMS offers accurate tracking, automation and standardisation, reducing errors and enhancing  
efficiency. It empowers proactive decision-making, minimises stock-outs and improves team coordination.
These initiatives demonstrate SEM’s commitment to leveraging technology for operational excellence and enhancing  
accuracy, responsiveness and customer satisfaction.
AUTOMATED GUIDED VEHICLES (“AGVS”)
SEM introduced an initiative to enhance operational efficiency by deploying AGVs to handle loose-pick SKUs. 
SEM expects employing AGVs for loose pick SKUs to reduce manpower requirements significantly. The decrease is due to 
optimised efficiency from goods being transported directly to personnel for picking rather than individuals traversing the 
warehouse to locate items.
Introducing AGVs streamlines the workflow by minimising walking time and unnecessary manual handling. AGVs navigate 
through predefined routes, swiftly transporting goods to designated picking stations. 
This innovative approach optimises labour efficiency and reduces the margin for error and potential safety hazards  
associated with manual material handling. SEM is at the forefront of enhancing productivity while ensuring a safer and  
more streamlined working environment.
ENSURING SATISFACTION
SEM prioritises customer engagement and satisfaction, emphasising efficiency and convenience alongside trust and  
care. These values drive our commitment to delivering exceptional service with convenience, ensuring streamlined  
processes and attentive care that nurture long-lasting relationships.
CRAFTING YOUR PERSONALISED BUYING EXPERIENCE
Our Convenience Store Division employs various strategies to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.
• Our Customer Care Division manages diverse feedback channels including calls, emails and social 
platforms, ensuring seamless interaction and gathering valuable insights.
• 7E introduced a new mobile application for membership sign-ups. Our personalised 
Loyalty Programme, available through the My7E App, offers exclusive deals, discounts and 
point accumulation tailored specifically for members, enhancing their shopping experience.
Our active presence on social media platforms enables us to engage with 
customers proactively, promptly addressing their feedback and fostering 
meaningful interactions to further nurture relationships and satisfaction.

ADDRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES
ADVOCATING HEALTHY EATING AND A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
The retail and food environment play essential roles in shaping the dietary habits of the modern consumer. Nutritional 
information and the visibility of healthier food products inside our stores help customers make healthier nutritional choices. 
Throughout the year, 7E has made significant strides in promoting healthier dietary options and advocating wellness 
practices. We expanded our health food categories as a testament to our ongoing commitment to promoting better nutrition 
and prioritising customer well-being. Our target includes introducing a diverse range of new products to improve access to  
nutrition and encourage customers to make healthier dietary choices, contributing to their overall well-being. During the  
year, we have achieved this target by introducing offerings including Lactofit probiotics, Goodology Enzyme, Green Monster 
Kombucha, Go-Go meal replacement shakes and Kitsui health supplements. These offerings provide customers with a  
diverse selection to support their health and overall wellness.
Our product and innovation team remains dedicated to expanding our array of healthy food and beverage options through 
targeted research and development, contributing to a healthier community. Collaborating with industry peers, we strategise to 
promote products with minimised negative impacts, particularly addressing concerns related to processed foods and drinks. 
Strictly prohibiting alcohol and medication safeguards vulnerable groups, such as children. Customers must present identity 
cards to purchase alcohol; tobacco and controlled drugs require a doctor's prescription, ensuring responsible and secure 
transactions.
BOOST YOUR WELL-BEING AT 7CAFE
We are thrilled to highlight 7Cafe's diverse, delicious and healthy meal options. Our convenient on-the-go choices  
focus on customer well-being and deliver a delightful and nourishing experience. The menu includes enticing

vulnerable children. We ensure our campaigns align with responsible and inclusive messaging.
CARiNG has introduced the CARiNG Quit Smoking service as a proactive measure to address the detrimental impacts 
of excessive cigarette consumption. This initiative extends complimentary counselling services to the community,  
underscoring the significance of overcoming addictive behaviours. Leveraging the expertise of CARiNG's committed 
pharmacists, individuals are guided through tailored smoking cessation plans, which may incorporate Nicotine  
Replacement Therapy for enhanced effectiveness. Additionally, we collaborate with the Ministry of Health and Johnson & 
Johnson to actively promote No Tobacco Day, contributing to the broader public awareness and advocacy against the  
harmful impacts of smoking.
EMPOWERING CHOICES WITH RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
SEM is committed to the responsible promotion of all products, maintaining transparency and adherence to regulations within 
our Convenience Stores and Pharmaceutical Division. 
We embrace responsible advertising and commit to responsibly marketing and advertising all products, including processed 
food. Our Convenience Store Division strictly adheres to the Food Regulations 1985 of the Ministry of Health for product labels. 
Our detailed guidelines ensure compliance, fostering customer awareness regarding processed foods and beverages. Our 
dedication extends to reducing the negative impact of processed food and drink by promoting healthier choices and actively 
engaging in initiatives that encourage informed decision-making regarding nutrition and well-being. 7E private labels provide 
comprehensive information on ingredients and key dietary details, displayed through front-of-package labels that highlight 
nutritional benefits like "high in fibre”, "high in protein”, "cholesterol-free”, "trans-fat-free" and “low in sodium”, empowering 
customers to make informed and healthier choices.
The CARiNG Patient Medication Record (“PMR”), an electronic system, diligently documents medication histories,  
empowering customers with health knowledge. Members accessing the PMR can conveniently view their health records, 
including medications, health data (such as blood pressure readings) and allergies, on the Mobile App's MyHealth section. 
This accessible information helps physicians during follow-up appointments, enhancing the effective management of  
patients' medical conditions.
Our Chronic Disease Management Programme actively promotes regular doctor follow-ups and prescription renewals, 
underscoring our dedication to the overall well-being of our valued customers.
We provide comprehensive training on product labels and responsible marketing practices for our store employees. 
Implementing purchasing requirements, especially for controlled drugs, mitigates the risks of adverse impacts and side  
effects from excessively consuming our products, spanning food, beverages and medications.
GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND EXPECTATIONS THROUGH COLLABORATION
CARiNG Pharmacy promotes healthy lifestyles in the local communities. Collaboration is the best way for communities  
to reach their highest and healthiest potential. Engaging with individual, doctor, community, and organisational stakeholders 
inspires communities and neighbourhoods to make positive health impacts. 
CARiNG collaborates with various institutions on research projects and health programmes, including collaborations with:
• Universiti Malaya to promote safe medicine disposal
• Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia on a medication review research project
• Monash University on Prediabetes, Intervention, Management and Evaluation Programme (“PRiME”) – a study on

SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT
ELEVATE YOUR EXPERIENCE: ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU, BEYOND CARE
With the tagline "Always There for You", 7E delivers customers a more convenient and fulfilling shopping experience. Our 
Convenience Stores Division is the largest convenience store chain, with 2,566 stores nationwide as of 31 December 2023. 
Serving over 1 million daily, customers can quickly locate us wherever they are for fresh food, snacks, drinks, coffee and  
other necessities. 
Our Pharmaceutical Division introduced domestic and international home delivery services. This initiative expands our reach 
and caters to a broader customer base. In 2023, we implemented a Click & Collect service. Consumers may conveniently 
purchase and retrieve items online at their nearest stores, providing a seamless and flexible shopping experience.
All Convenience Store and Pharmaceutical Division stores work closely with supply-chain partners to maintain well-stocked 
shelves, especially essential items, to prevent customer disappointment and inconvenience.
Our vibrant social media presence demonstrates our commitment to staying connected with customers. Providing engaging 
and valuable content across these platforms ensures that our online presence reflects our dedication to keeping our  
customers and the public informed and entertained.
Social Media Performance
COMPETITIVE PRICING: DELIVERING VALUE FOR EVERY PURCHASE
The Convenience Store Division is the go-to convenience store for everyone, prioritising fair and competitive pricing  
strategies centred around value. Conducting a monthly review of the top 400 SKUs and comparing them with competitor  
prices helps us uphold this commitment. Thorough price checks allow us to continually adjust our pricing, ensuring 
competitiveness while delivering customer value.
REWARDING LOYALTY
The 7E Rewards programme, accessible through the My7E mobile app, offers users many advantages: customers  
accumulate points, access exclusive e-coupons, and earn e-stamp rewards for repeat purchases.  
Users earn 1 My7E Point for every RM1 spent, with options to fast-track points through selected products offering  
multipliers. Participating in promotions earns extra bonus points. The programme facilitates direct customer feedback, 
enabling continuous improvements based on user suggestions. The app also ensures convenience by allowing users to pinpoint  
nearby 7-Eleven stores using Google Maps, informing them about ongoing store campaigns and fresh product launches. 
Similarly, CARiNG membership is a lifestyle and member rewards programme designed to collect and redeem rewards and 
enjoy various product discounts at any CARiNG Pharmacy, Georgetown Pharmacy,  Wellings Pharmacy and CARiNG eStore. 
Members enjoy benefits and rewards, including birthday treats, collect and redeem points and news of exclusive promotions 
and discounts. Last year, we introduced a tiered system where members can unlock additional rewards as they progress 
through different tiers. This enhancement allows members to enjoy increasingly valuable benefits as they advance within the 
reward programme.

FOSTERING AWARENESS ON RESPONSIBLE MEDICATION DISPOSAL
Many consumers stock medicines "just in case" and do not know the correct disposal method for expired medication. 
CARiNG's "Do It Right" campaign advocates properly disposing of unused or expired medicines to prevent pharmaceutical 
waste from adversely affecting the environment. We also educate customers on the safe consumption, storage and  
disposal of medications. Implementing various initiatives, including microsites, leaflets, videos, official store posters  
and eye-catching car wrap advertisements, raises public and customer awareness.
The Pharmaceutical segment supports these communication channels by organising numerous awareness-raising  
events. The "Munchmon" character — a friendly monster with an appetite for unwanted medicines - makes the message of 
proper disposal more memorable and creative. This initiative encourages the public to support the "Do It Right" movement.
Collaborating with Haleon for their Earth Day Roadshow and Medicine Disposal Talk boosted these campaign efforts. This 
partnership took the campaign to the streets, with corporate roadshows at prominent locations such as Calsbery, RHB  
Centre and Ernst & Young Malaysia. Together, we collectively promote the "Do It Right" initiative.
We extended our reach by collaborating with educational institutions. Participation in events such as the Monash University 
Open Day and the Sunway College exhibition provided platforms to engage with students, reiterating the importance of 
responsible medicine disposal through the "Do It Right" campaign.

TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
SEM's digital evolution promotes customer convenience and operational efficiency by strategically integrating state-of-the-
art technological solutions. This comprehensive initiative streamlines processes, optimises operations and elevates service 
delivery across diverse business areas.
We augment efficiency by implementing an advanced transportation management system, further digitalising our supply 
chain operations. This customised integration optimises routes, diminishes empty miles and curtails fuel consumption,  
substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
At our operations, 100% of our stores accept e-wallets and credit cards, promoting a cashless environment and digital  
evolution.
Our successful deployment of the Human Resource Information System ("HRIS") allows the remote handling of HR tasks, 
providing data accuracy and security. It empowers employees to manage their personal information effectively.
We also introduced the Electronic Workflow System ("EWS") in August 2023. The built-in digital portal streamlines purchase 
requisitions, legal contracts, tenancy management, and site proposals. EWS significantly bolsters overall time efficiency, 
reduces paper usage, enhances document tracking and expedites approvals.
TRANSFORMING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
Our commitment to transforming customer experience remains unwavering. As we march forward, sustainability takes  
centre stage as we actively champion excellence and value. Our focus on healthy living and nutrition underscores the pivotal 
role of well-being in our communities. With a forward-looking approach, SEM is not just a retail destination but a beacon 
for those seeking convenience, affordability, and a holistic and sustainable lifestyle. We envision a future where SEM  
thrives, setting new benchmarks for customer satisfaction, sustainability and community well-being.

and ethically to enhance shareholders’ value, besides safeguarding stakeholders’ interest. In its application of corporate 
governance practices, the Board has taken into consideration the enumerations of the Malaysian Code on Corporate  
Governance (“MCCG” or the “Code”) and Paragraph 15.25 of the Main Market Listing Requirements (“Listing

•	 developing	 a	corporate	code	of	conduct	to	address,	amongst	others,	any	conflict	of	interest	relating	to	Directors,	
major	shareholders	and	employees	in	the	Group.	
  
Chairman of the Board
The Chairman, Datuk Wira Farhash Wafa Salvador is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director who chairs and leads  
the Board meetings by encouraging and eliciting the views of all the Board members. He ensures that proper  
weightage and time are given to issues of corporate governance, business operations and strategies raised in the  
Board meetings. In the absence of the Chairman, the role of Chairman will be undertaken by the Deputy Chairman.
The	 roles	 of	 the	 Chairman	 are	 separated	 from	 the	 Co-Chief	 Executive	 Officers.	 The	 Co-Chief	 Executive	 Officers,	 
Mr. Tan U-Ming and Mr. Wong Wai Keong are responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of the business.
There	is	a	clear	division	of	responsibilities	between	the	Chairman	of	the	Board	and	the	Co-Chief	Executive	Officers	 
to ensure a balance of power and authority. The Chairman is responsible for ensuring the integrity and effectiveness  
of	the	governance	process	of	the	Board	while	the	Co-Chief	Executive	Officers	hold	the	primary	executive	responsibility	 
for the Group’s business performance and manage the Group in accordance with the strategies and policies approved  
by the Board.
The Board views that the Chairman of the Board should not be involved in any Board Committees. This is to ensure a  
due	check	and	balance	as	well	as	that	objectivity	will	not	be	impaired/influenced	by	the	Chairman	of	the	Board	if	 
the Chairman also sits on Board Committee(s). Therefore, our Chairman of the Board is not a member of any of the  
Board Committees which is in line with MCCG.

1) establishing clear roles and responsibilities of the Board ( cont’d)
Qualified Company Secretaries
The Company Secretaries play an advisory role to the Board in relation to the Company’s Constitution, policies,  
procedures and compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, code or guidance and legislations. 
The Directors have unrestricted access to the advice and services of the Company Secretaries to enable them to  
discharge their duties effectively and the Board’s procedures are adhered to at all times. The Board is regularly updated 
and	advised	by	the	Company	Secretaries	who	are	qualified	and	experienced	on	statutory	and	regulatory	requirements,	and

The	Company	Secretaries	organise	and	attend	all	Board	meetings	including	the	Annual	General	Meetings	and	ensure	
that all procedures are followed and all the Company’s statutory records are updated and maintained accordingly at  
the Company’s registered address.
Directors
The Executive Directors are responsible for providing leadership and overseeing the day-to-day operations and  
management	within	their	specific	areas	of	expertise	or	assigned	responsibilities.	
The Non-Executive Directors, both Independent as well as Non-Independent, are not involved in the day-to-day  
management of the Company but contribute to the development of the Company’s business strategies with the 
expertise and experience they bring to the Board. The Non-Executive Directors’ involvement in, and contribution to, the  
Board Committees enhances the effectiveness of the Company’s governance processes by providing independent 
judgement	and	objectivity	to	the	Board’s	decisions.	
Access to information and advice
Directors are entitled to unrestricted access to all the Company’s information, documents, records and properties,  
either as a full Board or in their individual capacity in order to better discharge their responsibilities. 
To facilitate the Board meetings, notices on agenda together with supporting Board papers are circulated to the  
Directors in advance of each Board meeting. The Board papers include, amongst others, Quarterly Financial Report,  
Internal	 Audit	 Report,	 minutes	 of	 all	 Board	 Committees	 meetings,	 list	 of	 all	 announcements	 made,	 summary	 of	 
Directors’ dealings, list of all Board Circular Resolutions passed and any other matters requiring the Board’s approval. 
Senior Management, other senior executives or professional advisers are invited to attend the Board meetings to  
provide	additional	insights	and	professional	views,	advice	and	explanation	on	specific	items	on	the	Meeting	agenda,	 
where necessary. 
The Board has adopted a policy enabling the Board Committees and Directors to have access to independent  
professional advice at the Company’s expense as and when considered necessary, in furtherance of their duties. This 
policy is included in the Board Charter.  
Technology is effectively used in the Board and Board Committees’ meetings. The agenda and meeting materials are  
sent online to the Directors before the hardcopy versions of the same. Where the Directors are in remote areas or  
overseas, they are encouraged to participate in meetings via audio or video conferencing.
2) Demarcation of responsibilities
Board Charter
The Company has established and adopted a Board Charter which serves as a reference point for Board activities. The  
Board Charter provides guidance for Directors and Management regarding the responsibilities of the Board, Board 
Committees and Senior Management, the requirements of Directors in carrying out their stewardship roles and in 
discharging	their	fiduciary	duties	towards	the	Company	as	well	as	Boardroom	activities.	The	Board	Charter	is	publicly	
available on the Company’s website at www.7eleven.com.my. 
The Board has established a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its deliberation and decision in  
order to enhance the delineation of roles between the Board and Management, as well as to ensure the direction and 
control of the Group’s operations are in the Board’s hands.

Recognising that sound corporate governance practices are pivotal for the smooth, effective, and transparent  
operation	of	7-Eleven,	the	Board	emphasises	its	role	in	garnering	investor	confidence,	protecting	shareholders’	rights,	
and unlocking shareholder value. Transparency and accountability are championed in the boardroom and throughout  
the entirety of the Company.

While there are individual provisions governing employees’ behaviour and conduct, the Company recognises the 
importance of having in place a formalised Code of Conduct/ Ethics setting out ethical corporate culture, acceptable 
behaviour, business ethics and conduct for the Group’s employees, and steps will be taken to formalise such a Code  
of Conduct/ Ethics for observance by the Group’s employees, including mechanisms to monitor compliance thereof. 
Whistle blowing
The Board has established a whistle blowing mechanism, including pertinent policies and procedures, with the aim 
to provide an avenue for concerns relating to possible breaches of business conduct, non-compliances of laws and  
regulatory requirements, and other questionable practices to be raised by employees as well as outside parties without 
fear of reprisals or retaliation by the Company. 
The Company’s Whistle Blowing Policy which can be viewed in detail at the Company’s website at  
www.7eleven.com.my outlines the processes and procedures on how to raise a concern properly should there be any 
breach of ethics, improprieties or irregularities involving any employee, Management or Directors of the Company.
Sustainability
The Board is mindful of its responsibility on the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) aspects of business 
sustainability.	As	such,	the	ESG	aspects	are	considered	by	the	Board	in	its	corporate	strategies.	Cognisant	of	this	
responsibility, the Board has adopted a Sustainability Policy that addresses the impact of the Group’s businesses on  
ESG elements.
Anti-corruption policies 
The	Company	adopted	the	Anti	Bribery	&	Anti-Corruption	(“ABAC”)	control	framework	including	delivery	of	tone	at	 
the	top	messages	and	awareness	campaigns;	ABAC	risk	assessments,	undertaking	control	measures	by	enhancing	
our policies and procedures, compliance monitoring and enforcements; and training and communication to address  
the	 prevention	 of	 bribery	 and	 corruption,	 and	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Malaysian	 Anti-Corruption	 Commission’s	 
(“MACC”)	Adequate	Procedures	Guidelines.

Part II: Board composition
1) strengthening the Board’s composition
As	of	the	date	of	this	Statement,	the	Board	consisted	of	nine	(9)	members,	comprising	two	(2)	Executive	Directors,	 
four (4) Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors, one (1) Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and two (2) 
Independent	Non-Executive	Directors.	This	composition	fulfils	the	Listing	Requirements,	which	stipulate	that	at	least	
three (3) Directors or one-third (1/3) of the Board, whichever is higher, must be independent. The Board took note of the 
requirement of Practice 5.2 of the MCCG which requires at least half of the Board comprises Independent Directors. 
However, the Nominating Committee (“NC”) is of the view that the current Board size and composition is appropriate 
and	effective	taking	account	the	nature	of	business	operations	of	the	Company.	The	Board	is	also	satisfied	with	the	 
current board composition, nevertheless, the Board may consider increasing the number of Independent Directors  
should there be a suitable candidate.
The	profile	of	each	Director	is	set	out	on	pages	10	to	14	of	this	Annual	Report.	The	Directors,	with	their	diverse	 
background	and	qualifications,	collectively	bring	with	them	a	wide	range	of	experience	and	expertise	in	areas	such	as	
accounting	and	auditing,	taxation,	retail,	finance,	legal,	information	technology	and	investment.
The	presence	of	Independent	Non-Executive	Directors	fulfils	the	pivotal	role	in	corporate	accountability.	The	role	of	
Independent Non-Executive Directors is particularly important as they provide unbiased and independent views, advices 
and	judgements	to	take	into	account	of	the	interest,	not	only	of	the	Group,	but	also	the	stakeholders.
Board Committees
To assist in the discharge of its stewardship role, the Board has established the following Board Committees to  
examine	specific	matters	within	their	respective	terms	of	reference,	as	approved	by	the	Board:
•	 Audit	Committee;
•	 Nominating	Committee;
•	 Remuneration	Committee;	and
•	 Risk	Management	and	Sustainability	Committee.
All	 the	 deliberation,	 discussions	 and	 outcome	 of	 the	 committee	 meetings	 are	 reported	 by	 the	 Chairman	 of	 the	 
respective Board Committees to the Board, while the ultimate responsibility for decision making lies with the Board.
I. Audit Committee
The	Audit	Committee	assists	the	Board	in	carrying	out	its	statutory	and	fiduciary	responsibilities	with	regards	to	
the	monitoring	and	management	of	financial	risk	processes,	accounting	practices,	internal	control	system,	and	
the	Group’s	management	and	financial	reporting	practices.	To	accomplish	this,	the	Audit	Committee	oversees	 
the	reports	of	external	and	internal	auditors,	protects	the	integrity	of	financial	reporting	and	ensures	a	sound	 
system	of	internal	controls	to	protect	and	enhance	the	Company’s	value.	The	Terms	of	Reference	of	the	Audit	
Committee is publicly available on the Company’s website at www.7eleven.com.my.
Details	of	Audit	Committee	activities	are	reported	in	the	Audit	Committee	Report	on	pages	93	to	95.

Committee’s membership, and to review the effectiveness of the Board, through performance assessment of the 
Board,	Board	Committees,	individual	Director	and	individual	Audit	Committee	member.	The	terms	of	reference	of

A	formal	performance	assessment	of	the	Board,	Board	Committees	and	individual	Directors	enables	the	Board	
to assess its performance and identify areas for improvement. Such a formal assessment was conducted for 
the	financial	year	ended	31	December	2023,	and	was	guided	by	the	Corporate	Governance	Guide	–	Towards	 
Boardroom Excellence taking into consideration the following key elements for assessment:
•	 appropriate	 size,	composition,	independence,	mix	of	skills	and	experience	within	the	Board	and	the	Board	
Committees;

•	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 Board	 and	 Board	 Committees	 in	 carrying	 out	 their	 roles	 and	 responsibilities	 as	 
stipulated in the Board Charter and/or terms of reference;
•	 sufficiency 	and	relevance	of	knowledge	and	expertise	of	individual	Directors	in	their	respective	capacity	as	
members of the Board and Board Committees; and
•	 Directors’	 character,	 experience,	 competency,	 integrity,	 and	 time	 commitment	 to	 effectively	 discharge

Non-Executive	Director’	as	provided	by	the	Listing	Requirements	of	Bursa	Securities,	and	such	definition	is	used	as	 
criteria for Directors’ independence assessment, which has been carried out as at the date of this Statement.

in	providing	unbiased	opinion	and	judgment	to	ensure	that	the	interests	of	the	Group,	shareholders,	customers	and	 
other stakeholders are taken into account during its decision making process. The Board consists of three (3)  
Independent Directors who were neither involved in the business transactions nor participated in the day-to-day 
management of the Group. 
 The Company meets the requirement prescribed by the Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities to have at least  
one-third (1/3) of its Board members being Independent Directors.
 The Board takes cognisance Practice 5.2 of the MCCG where the Board shall comprise at least half of the Independent 
Directors, the Board is of the view that the current composition of Independent Non-Executive Directors fairly reflects  
the	interest	of	minority	shareholders	of	the	Company	through	the	Board’s	representation.	The	Board	is	satisfied	with	
the level of independence demonstrated by the Independent Non-Executive Directors and their ability to act in the best 
interests of the Company.

The Board has also stipulated in its Board Charter, the need for Directors to notify the Chairman before accepting 
new directorships outside the Group and indicating the time that will be spent on the new directorship. Similarly, the  
Chairman of the Board shall also do likewise, and notify the Board as a whole, before taking up any additional  
appointment of directorships. This practice is to ensure that Directors devote sufficient time to meet the Company’s  
needs and in the discharge of their fiduciary and leadership roles.
The Board is mindful that continuous education is vital for Board members to gain insight into the state of the  
economy, technological advances, regulatory updates and management strategies to enhance the Board’s skill sets and 
knowledge in discharging its responsibilities. 
All	Directors	appointed	to	the	Board,	apart	from	attending	the	Mandatory	Accreditation	Programme	of	Bursa	Securities,	
have also attended other relevant trainings, conferences and seminars organised by relevant regulatory and professional 
bodies to be apprised of latest developments and changes to regulatory requirements that may affect their roles as 
Directors of the Company.

1) upholding integrity in financial reporting (Cont’d)
	 To	 assist	 in	 the	 discharge	 of	 its	 duties	 on	 financial	 reporting,	 the	 Board	 has	 established	 an	 Audit	 Committee,	 
comprising	 wholly	 Non-Executive	 Directors	 with	 a	 majority	 of	 Independent	 Non-Executive	 Directors,	 chaired	 by	 an	
Independent	Non-Executive	Director.	The	composition	of	the	Audit	Committee,	including	its	roles	and	responsibilities,	 
are	set	out	in	the	Audit	Committee	Report	on	pages	93	to	95	of	this	Annual	Report.	One	(1)	of	the	key	responsibilities	 
of	the	Audit	Committee	in	its	specific	terms	of	reference	is	to	ensure	that	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	
the	Company	comply	with	the	applicable	approved	financial	reporting	standards	in	Malaysia	and	provisions	of	the	 
Companies	Act	2016.	Such	financial	statements	comprise	the	quarterly	financial	report	announced	to	Bursa	Securities	 
and	the	annual	statutory	financial	statements.
	 None	 of	the	Audit	Committee	members	was	a	former	key	audit	partner	of	the	Company	and	the	Board	would	consider	
establishing a written policy that requires a former key audit partner to observe a cooling-off period of at least three 
(3)	years	before	being	appointed	as	a	member	of	the	Audit	Committee	when	the	Board	reviews	the	term	of	reference	 
of	the	Audit	Committee	in	due	course.
	 All	 members	of	the	Audit	Committee	have	the	relevant	accounting	and/or	related	financial	experience	and	expertise	to	
effectively	discharge	their	duties.	The	qualifications	and	experience	of	each	individual	Audit	Committee	member	are	
disclosed	in	the	Directors’	Profile	in	this	Annual	Report.
	 The	 Directors	are	satisfied	that	in	preparing	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	the	Company	for	the	financial	
year ended 31 December 2023, the Group has used appropriate accounting policies and applied them consistently. The 
Directors	are	also	of	the	view	that	relevant	applicable	approved	financial	reporting	standards	have	been	followed	in	the	
preparation	of	these	financial	statements.
	 The	 Board	understands	its	role	in	upholding	the	integrity	of	financial	reporting	by	the	Company.	Accordingly,	the	Audit	
Committee,	which	assists	the	Board	in	overseeing	the	financial	reporting	process	of	the	Company,	has	formalised	
a	 Non-Audit	 Services	 Policy	 governing	 the	 types	 of	 non-audit	 services	 permitted	 to	 be	 provided	 by	 the	 External	 
Auditors.	 To	 address	 the	 threats	 faced	 by	 the	 External	 Auditors,	 including	 self-review	 and	 self-interest	 threats	 in	 
relation	 to	 the	 independence	 and	 objectivity	 of	 the	 External	 Auditors,	 the	 Non-Audit	 Services	 Policy	 provides	 for	 
safeguards	which	may	be	considered,	including	having	an	engagement	team	different	from	the	External	Audit	team	to	
provide the non-audit services. 
	 In	 assessing	 the	 independence	 of	 External	 Auditors,	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 obtains	 confirmation	 from	 the	 External	 
Auditors,	indicating	that	they	are,	and	have	been,	independent	throughout	the	conduct	of	the	audit	engagement	with	the	
Company	in	accordance	with	the	independence	criteria	set	out	by	the	Malaysian	Institute	of	Accountants.
	 The	 Audit	Committee,	after	due	deliberation,	has	recommended	the	re-appointment	of	Messrs.	Ernst	&	Young	PLT	as	
the	External	Auditors	for	the	financial	year	ending	31	December	2024.	The	Board	at	its	meeting	held	on	18	April	2024	
approved	the	Audit	Committee’s	recommendation.	The	re-appointment	of	Messrs.	Ernst	&	Young	PLT	will	be	presented	 
for	shareholders’	approval	at	the	forthcoming	Eleventh	AGM.
2) recognising and managing risks
	 The	 Board	regards	risk	management	and	internal	controls	as	an	integral	part	of	the	overall	management	processes.	As	
such,	the	Board	has	established	an	Enterprise	Risk	Management	(“ERM”)	framework	to	identify	and	manage	significant	
risks faced in the Group’s operations. For the effective implementation of ERM, a Risk Management Working Group, headed 
by	the	Co-Chief	Executive	Officers,	has	been	established,	comprising	key	management	personnel	from	the	respective	
divisions. The Risk Management Working Group is tasked to report to the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee 
on	key	risks	identified	and	the	implementation	of	action	plans	to	mitigate	the	risks.	The	Board	is	apprised,	via	the	Risk	
Management	and	Sustainability	Committee,	of	the	Group’s	risk	profile,	including	action	plans	to	address	the	significant	
risks.	On	20	April	2022,	the	Group	merged	the	Sustainability	Management	Committee	and	Risk	Management	Committee.
	 The	 Board	has	outsourced	its	internal	audit	function	to	a	professional	firm,	namely	KPMG	Management	&	Risk	Consulting	
Sdn.	Bhd.	The	internal	audit	function	reports	directly	to	the	Audit	Committee	and	Risk	Management	and	Sustainability	
Committee on the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls. The internal audit function is  
independent of the Company, Board and Management. The scope of works covered by the internal audit function  
for	the	financial	year	under	review	is	furnished	in	the	Audit	Committee	Report	as	set	out	on	pages	93	to	95 of this  
Annual	Report.	The	internal	audit	carried	out	by	the	internal	audit	function	is	guided	by	internal	auditing	standards	 
promulgated	by	the	Institute	of	Internal	Auditors	Inc.,	a	globally	recognised	professional	body	for	internal	auditors.	 
The	cost	incurred	on	the	internal	audit	function	for	the	financial	year	under	review	was	amounted	to	approximately	
RM90,000.00.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of 7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad (“7-Eleven” or the “Company”) is committed 
to maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control in the Group (comprising the Company and its  
subsidiaries) and is pleased to provide the following Risk Management and Internal Control Statement (the “Statement”),  
which	outlines	the	nature	and	scope	of	risk	management	and	internal	control	of	the	Group	for	the	financial	year	ended	 
31 December 2023 (“FY2023”). For the purpose of disclosure, the Board has taken into consideration the Statement  
on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers (the “Guidelines”), a publication  
issued by Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) on the issuance of Risk Management and Internal  
Control Statement pursuant to Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities.
BoArD resPonsIBIlItY
The	Board	recognises	the	importance	of	maintaining	a	sound	system	of	internal	control	and	the	proper	identification	and	
management	of	risks	affecting	the	Group’s	operations	in	order	to	safeguard	shareholders’	investments.	Accordingly,	the	 
Board	affirms	its	overall	responsibility	for	the	Group’s	system	of	risk	management	and	internal	control,	and	for	reviewing	 
the	adequacy	and	operating	effectiveness	of	the	said	system.	The	system	covers	not	only	financial	but	operational	and	
compliance risks and the relevant controls designed to manage the said risks. In view of the limitations inherent in any  
system of risk management and internal control, the system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of  
failure	to	achieve	the	Group’s	corporate	objectives.	The	system	can,	therefore,	only	provide	reasonable,	but	not	absolute	
assurance, against material misstatement or losses.
rIsk MAnAGeMent frAMework
The Board believes that risk management is vital to the Group’s operational sustainability and the enhancement of  
shareholders’ value. The Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework for the Group, focuses on the Group’s core  
business operations and primarily comprised the following:
•	 Risk	management	policy	and	guidelines,	which	have	been	adopted	by	the	Board;	and
•	 Structured	 process	on	risk	identification,	evaluation,	mitigating	controls,	monitoring	and	reporting.	
rIsk APPetIte
Risk appetite refers to the levels and categories of risk the Group is prepared to accept in pursuit of its business and  
strategic goals as set out in its risk parameters. The Board recognises the need to balance the Group’s risk appetite with 
its	objective	to	maximise	long	term	value	and	that	the	Group’s	risk	appetite	has	to	remain	adaptable	to	changing	market	 
conditions and business goals so as to minimise the potential for loss while also maximising opportunities for growth.

implementation of appropriate controls to manage these risks. The Board approves the risk management strategies but 
delegates	authority	through	the	RMSC	and	RMWG	for	risk	management,	including	the	timely	review	of	identified	risks	and	 
the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and controls.

objectives,	to	collate	and	assess	the	critical	risks	identified	at	the	Risk	Management	Unit	level	and	to	perform	overall	risk	 
oversight	before	escalating	the	significant	risks	and	any	other	material	issues	to	RMSC.

At	the	Risk	Management	Unit	level,	the	respective	risk	owners	are	responsible	for	identifying	risks	that	may	have	an	adverse	
impact	to	their	operational	and/or	financial	goals,	including	any	other	business	objectives.	In	assessing	and	monitoring	 
identified	risks,	the	Group	employs	the	use	of	a	matrix	to	map	out	the	risk	materiality	impact	and	likelihood	of	occurrence.	And	
after taking into consideration the effectiveness of mitigating controls and action plans taken or proposed to be taken, these 
identified	risks	are	then	ranked	according	to	their	residual	risks.	The	said	risk	matrix	is	assessed	and	reviewed	over	time,	in	
accordance with the changes in the Group’s operating landscape and strategic direction, to ensure relevancy and effectiveness.
In	FY2023,	the	RMSC	had	duly	reviewed,	appraised	and	assessed	the	efficacy	of	the	controls	and	progress	of	action	plans	 
taken to mitigate, monitor and manage the Group’s risk exposure. The RMSC has subsequently provided assurance to the  
Board that the Group’s ERM framework and internal controls are operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.  
The RMSC has reviewed and the Board has subsequently approved the Group Governance Framework.

The	objectives	of	this	Procedure	are	to:
•	 Outline	 the	Group’s	risk	context	which	comprises	its	philosophies,	strategies	and	policies,	and	operating	system	so	as	to	
better manage the principal business risks faced by the Group;
•	 Provide	 guiding	ERM	principles	and	a	common	approach	to	Head	of	Departments	to	govern	the	actions	of	their	operating

InternAl Control frAMework
The key elements of the Group’s internal control framework are described below:
(a) limits of authority and responsibility
A	process	of	hierarchical	reporting	has	been	established	which	provides	for	a	documented	trail	of	accountability.	This	
includes	clearly	defined	lines	and	limits	of	authority,	responsibility	and	accountability	which	have	been	established	 
through	 the	 Group’s	organisational	 structures	 and	 authority	 limits,	 including	 specific	 matters	 requiring	 the	 Board’s	 
approval; and
(b) Planning, monitoring and reporting
The following internal control processes have been established:
•	 Strategic	Business	Planning 	Processes
	 Appropriate	 business	 plans	 are	 developed	where	 the	 Group’s	business	 objectives,	 strategies	and	 targets	 are	
articulated to the Board. Business planning and budgeting are undertaken annually to establish plans and targets 
against which performance is monitored on an ongoing basis;
•	 Documented	Policies	and	Procedures
 Internal policies and procedures, which are set out in standard operating manuals, covering core operational areas  
of	the	Group,	are	maintained	to	streamline	activities	and	are	subject	to	review	as	considered	necessary;
•	 Performance	Monitoring	and	Reporting
	 The	Group’s	management	team	monitors	and	reviews	the	Group’s	financial	and	operational	performance	on	a	
monthly basis, including monitoring and reporting of performance against the operating plans. The management 
team formulates and communicates action plans to address areas of concern;
•	 Financial	Performance	Review
	 The	 quarterly	and	annual	results	of	the	Group	are	reviewed	by	the	Audit	Committee	which	recommends	to	the	 
Board	for	approval	before	release	of	the	same	to	the	regulators	whilst	the	full	year	financial	statements	are	 
audited	by	the	External	Auditors	before	their	issuance	to	the	regulators	and	shareholders;
•	 Safeguarding	of	Assets	
	 Sufficient	 insurance	coverage	and	physical	safeguards	over	major	assets	of	the	Group	are	in	place	to	ensure	that	 
the assets are adequately protected against calamities and/ or theft that may result in material losses to the  
Group. 
This	internal	control	framework	has	been	in	place	for	the	financial	year	under	review	and	up	to	the	date	of	approval	of	 
this	Statement	for	inclusion	in	the	Annual	Report	of	the	Company.

The Board is of the view that there has been no material breakdown or weakness in the system of risk management and 
internal	control	of	the	Group	for	the	financial	year	ended	31	December	2023	that	may	result	in	a	significant	loss	to	the

(Incorporated in Malaysia)
Key audit matters (cont'd.)
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to the matters described
below. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to
our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results
of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below,
provide the basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
Recognition of rebates and incentives income from vendors
(Refer to Notes 2.25(g), 3(b)(i) and 17 to the financial statements)
The Group receives various types of allowance in the form of rebates and incentives from its
vendors in connection with the purchase of goods from those vendors. These allowances
contribute significantly to the Group’s profit before tax. During the financial year ended 31
December 2023, the Group has recognised rebates and incentives income amounting to
RM383,128,000 of which majority has been received and the balance of RM82,615,000 is
receivable as at 31 December 2023. Recognition of rebates and incentives income required
the Group’s fulfilment of its obligations under contractual arrangement with vendors. We
focused on this area because the recognition of rebates and incentives income requires, to
some extent, judgement from management concerning the nature and level of fulfilment of
the Group’s obligations under the vendor agreements.
Our procedures to address this area of focus include, amongst others, the following:
• understand and tested management’s controls around the completeness and accuracy of
the source data required for the computation of these rebates and incentives;
• involved our information technology specialists to test the operating effectiveness of
automated controls over the processing and recording of rebates and incentives as well as
assessed the accuracy of data interface between the Rebate system and the general ledger;
• reviewed and assessed the appropriateness of management’s computation of rebates and
incentives income for unsold inventories for financial year ended 31 December 2023;
• reviewed and assessed the appropriateness of management’s assessment on each type of
rebates and incentives received from vendors i.e. whether they are distinct services and
separate performance obligation as well as the classification in the statement of
comprehensive income in accordance to MFRS 15; and
• reviewed and agreed the rebates and incentives during the year to contractual evidence on
a sample basis. For the rebates and incentives receivable as at 31 December 2023,
amounts are either recalculated by us based on contractual terms confirmed by vendors or
reconciled to post year-end settlements with vendors.

Key audit matters (cont'd.)
Revenue from contracts with customers and cost of sales
(Refer to Notes 2.25 and 4 to the financial statements)
The Group relies heavily on information technology systems for the processing and recording
of revenue from sale of merchandise goods and the related cost of sales. The information
technology systems process large volumes of data which consists of individually low value
transactions. Accordingly, we identified the recognition of revenue and cost of sales to be
areas of audit focus as the magnitude and the high volume of transactions may give rise to a
higher risk of material misstatement relating to timing and the amount of revenue and cost of
sales recognised.
Our procedures to address this area of focus include, amongst others, the following:
• obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls over the revenue and cost of
sales recognition process and tested the operating effectiveness of these controls;
• involved our information technology specialists to test the operating effectiveness of
automated controls over the processing and recording of revenue and cost of sales;
• assessed the accuracy of data interface between the Point of Sales system and the general
ledger, including the updating of approved product price changes in the system;
• assessed the information technology-dependent manual (“ITDM”) and manual controls in
place to ensure the completeness and accuracy of revenue and cost of sales recognised;
• performed detailed review of Information Produced by Entity (“IPE”) for revenue by
performing procedures to corroborate the occurrence of revenue by tracing samples of
cash receipts to the settlement reports from financial institutions;
• performed substantive procedures which includes the use of data analytics to perform
correlation analysis between revenue, trade receivables and cash and bank balances;
• performed cut-off procedures to determine if revenue is recorded in the correct accounting
period; and
• performed cash anchor testing procedures to determine if cash received relates to
revenue.
Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other
information comprises the other information included in the Group's 2023 Annual Report, but
does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’
report thereon. The Group's 2023 Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after
the date of this auditors’ report.

(Incorporated in Malaysia)
Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon (cont'd.)
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the
other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our
responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the
Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to
the date of this auditors’ report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this
regard.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein,
we are required to communicate the matter to the directors of the Company and take
appropriate action.
Responsibilities of directors for the financial statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of
the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian
Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the
requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud of error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are
responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Independent auditors' report to the members of
7-Eleven Malaysia Holdings Berhad (cont'd.)
(Incorporated in Malaysia)
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of
the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and
International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the
Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial
statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont'd.)
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and
International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: (cont'd.)
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the
Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements
of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial
statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for
the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The adoption of the above amendments did not have any significant financial impact to
the Group and the Company, except for:
The amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance and
examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are
more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’
accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and
adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions
about accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments have had an impact on the Group’s and the Company’s disclosures of
accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any
items in the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.

The standards and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of
issuance of the Group's and the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below.
The Group and the Company intend to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they
become effective.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is
measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests
in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure
the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of
the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred
and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities
assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the
contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition
date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the
acquiree.

Business combination (cont'd.)
Acquisition of non-controlling interests
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair
value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not
measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent
consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the
scope of MFRS 9Financial Instruments , is measured at fair value with the changes in
fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with MFRS 9. Other
contingent consideration that is not within the scope of MFRS 9 is measured at fair value
at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests and
any previous interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate
consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to
measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate
consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group accounts for all changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not
result in a loss of control as equity transactions between the Group and its non-
controlling interest holders. Any difference between the Group’s share of net assets
before and after the change, and any consideration received or paid, is adjusted to or
against Group reserves.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are
accounted for at cost less impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the
difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts is included in profit
or loss.

2. Summary of material accounting policies (cont'd.)
2.5 Associate and joint ventures
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to
recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each
reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the
investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the
Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable
amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the
loss within ‘Share of profit of an associate and a joint venture’ in the statement of profit
or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint
venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value.
Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss
of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and
proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.
The Group's investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method, the
investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net
assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to
the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is
not tested for impairment separately.
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of
the associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part
of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the
equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes,
when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses
resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture
is shown on the face of the statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and
represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the
associate or joint venture.
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same
reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the
accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated. Capital work-
in-progress are also not depreciated as these assets are not available for use.
Depreciation of other property, plant and equipment is provided for on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, as follows:
Computer software acquired separately are measured initially at cost. Following initial
acquisition, computer software are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses.
Computer software-in-development are not depreciated as these assets are not
available for use. Computer software are amortised on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of 10 years when the assets are available for use. Computer
software are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the computer
software may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are
reviewed at least at each financial year end. Changes in the expected useful life or the
expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodies in the assets is
accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are
treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on computer
software is recognised in profit or loss.
Gain or loss from derecognition of computer software are measured as the difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are
recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised.

2.8 Leases
(a) As lessee
(i) Right-of-use assets
Property 1 to 15 years
Leasehold properties 50 to 99 years
(ii) Lease liabilities
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases,
except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises
lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the
right to use the underlying assets.
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the
lease. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of
lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease
liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at
or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-
use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease
term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities
measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease
term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed
payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that
depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual
value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a
purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments
of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend
on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to
produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers
the payment occurs.

2.9 Financial assets
(a) Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at
amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"), and fair
value through profit or loss ("FVTPL").
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair
value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of
principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment
is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.
The Group’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages
its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the
financial assets, or both.
The Group's lease liabilities are included in financial liabilities in Note 10.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its
incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the
interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the
accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the
carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a
change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments such as changes to
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine
such lease payments or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase
the underlying asset.

Financial assets designated at FVTOCI
Financial assets at FVTPL
This category includes all other instruments which the Group had not irrevocably
elected to classify at FVTOCI.
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity
investments as equity instruments designated at FVTOCI when they meet the
definition of equity under MFRS 132Financial Instruments: Presentation and are
not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument
basis.
The Group’s and the Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes trade
and  other receivables (excluding prepayments) and cash and bank balances.
The Group has elected to classify irrevocably its quoted equity investments under
this category.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss.
Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the
right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such
gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVTOCI are not
subject to impairment assessment.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of
financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the
statement of profit or loss.

The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
The Group and the Company have transferred their rights to receive cash flows
from the asset or have assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in
full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement;
and either:
the Group and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and
rewards of the asset, or
the Group and the Company have neither transferred nor retained
substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but have transferred
control of the asset.
When the Group and the Company have transferred their rights to receive cash
flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, the Group and
the Company evaluate if, and to what extent, the Group and the Company have
retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When the Group and the Company
have neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the
asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group and the Company continue to
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that
case, the Group and the Company also recognise an associated liability. The
transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects
the rights and obligations that the Group and the Company have retained.
The Group and the Company recognise an allowance for expected credit losses
("ECLs") for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are
based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the
contract and all the cash flows that the Group and the Company expect to receive,
discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash
flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements
that are integral to the contractual terms.
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group
of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

2.11 Inventories
2.12 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and at banks and demand deposits at
call which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Short term funds
include money market instruments held for investment purposes, which does not form
part of cash and cash equivalents.
For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of
unrestricted cash and bank balances, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, if any, as they
are considered an integral part of the Group’s and of the Company's cash management.
ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit
losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-
month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase
in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses
expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default
(a lifetime ECL).
For trade receivables, the Group and the Company apply a simplified approach in
calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group and the Company do not track changes in credit
risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting
date.
The Group and the Company consider factors if a financial asset in default such as the
probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or
significant delay in payments that indicate that the Group and the Company are unlikely
to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any
credit enhancements held by the Group and the Company. A financial asset is written off
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
Inventories comprise trading goods and consumables and are stated at the lower of cost
(determined on the weighted average basis) and net realisable value. Cost comprises
the invoiced value of the inventories and incidental expenses. Net realisable value
represents the estimated selling price less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

(a) Initial recognition and measurement
(b) Subsequent measurement
Loans and borrowings
(c) Derecognition
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective-interest-rate ("EIR") method. Gains
and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as
well as through the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is
discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is
treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new
liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the
statement of profit or loss.
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives
designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans
and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, and loans and
borrowings including bank overdrafts. The Group measures its financial liabilities as
loans and borrowings.

Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an
expense in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees
of the Group and the Company. Short term accumulating compensated absences
such as paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by
employees that increase their entitlement to future compensated absences. Short
term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick leave are recognised
when the absences occur.
As required by law, the Group makes contributions to the state pension scheme, the
Employees Provident Fund ("EPF"). Such contributions are recognised as an
expense in profit or loss as incurred.
The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using
the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ("the
functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Ringgit
Malaysia ("RM"), which is also the Company's functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional
currencies of the Company and its subsidiary companies and are recorded on initial
recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those
ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the
reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating
monetary items at the end of the reporting date are recognised in profit or loss.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for
which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant
observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

When another party is involved in providing services to its customers, the Group
determines whether it is a principal or an agent in these transactions by evaluating
the nature of its promise to the customer. When the Group's role is only to arrange
for another entity to provide the services, then the Group is an agent and will need
to record revenue at the net amount that it retains for its agency services.
Income from the rental of property is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance
with the terms of the agreements.
Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest
method.
Revenue from contracts with customers and other operating income is recognised when
control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its
revenue arrangements, except for the agency services for provision of in-store services,
because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the
customer.
Revenue from sale of general merchandise is recognised at the point in time when
control of the asset is transferred to the customer. These are in cash
considerations.
The Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are
separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs
to be allocated (e.g. customer loyalty points).

comprehensive income when the Group achieved the volume-purchase targets, the
performance obligations for central distribution arrangement, and promotional
programs have been fulfilled by the Group in accordance with the terms as
stipulated in the trade agreements with vendors. These rebates and discounts are
recognised as deduction against costs of goods sold when the goods are sold and
for the CDC rebates only, when goods are delivered to the stores. Rebates and
discounts for unsold goods and CDC rebates in respect of goods not delivered to
the stores yet, are deducted against inventories and shall be recognised to the
statements of comprehensive income when the goods are subsequently sold or
delivered to respective stores.
Other incentives mainly comprised in-store displays and promotions and
advertisements for specific products. Incentives are recognised to the statements of
comprehensive income when the performance obligations have been fulfilled by the
Group in accordance with the terms as stipulated in the agreements with vendors.
These incentives are recognised as other operating income in the statements of
comprehensive income.
Initial franchise fee is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the
franchise agreement. The transaction price for franchise agreement is discounted,
using the rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction between
the Group and its customers at contract inception, to take into consideration the
significant financing component.
Dividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive payment is
established.

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase,
sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any difference
between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in equity.
The Group's loyalty programme allows the customers to collect award credits when
specified sales terms were fulfilled by the customers. The customers can then
redeem the gifts once the specified number of award credits have been collected.
The Group accounts for the award credits as separately identifiable component of
the initial sales transactions. The fair value of the consideration received or
receivable in respect of the initial sales is allocated between the fair value of the
award credits and the other components of the sale.
The consideration allocated to the award credits is deferred and subsequently
recognised as revenue when the award credits are redeemed. The deferral is
treated as a deduction from revenue. The fair value of the award credits is
determined with reference to the fair value of the gift to the customer and considers
the redemption rate for the award credits.
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services
transferred to the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services
to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a
contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for
which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due)
from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers
goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the
payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are
recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.
The Group recognises contract assets for rebates and incentives income receivable.

3. Significant accounting judgements and estimates
(a) Critical judgements made in applying accounting policies
(i)
A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is
classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such
a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a
view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented as a single amount
in the statement of comprehensive income.
The preparation of the Group’s financial statements in accordance with MFRS requires
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures,
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount
of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.
In the process of applying the Group’s and the Company's accounting policies,
management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options
as lessee
The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease,
together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably
certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease,
if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain whether
or not to exercise the option to renew or terminate the lease. That is, it considers all
relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the
renewal or termination. After the commencement date, the Group reassess the
lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its
control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to
terminate such as the construction of significant leasehold improvements or
significant customisation to the leased asset.
The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases with
shorter non-cancellable period such as three to five years. The Group typically
exercise its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant
negative effect on production if a replacement asset is not readily available.

3. Significant accounting judgements and estimates (cont'd.)
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty
(i) Recognition of incentives and rebates
(ii) Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
(iii) Estimating the incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities
The Group receives rebates and incentives from suppliers for various programs,
primarily volume incentives, display and promotional incentives, prompt payment
discounts and warehouse rebates.
Certain incentives and rebates recognised in profit or loss were estimated based on
terms and rates in trade agreements entered into with suppliers. Actual amounts
received from suppliers could differ from the amounts initially estimated. As at the
reporting date, the Group has recognised incentives and rebates receivable of
RM82,615,000 (2022: RM57,375,000).
The Group carries its freehold and leasehold land and buildings at fair value, with
changes in fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group
engaged an independent valuation specialist to assess fair value as at 31 December
2023 and 31 December 2022.
The freehold and leasehold land and buildings were valued by reference to market-
based evidence, using comparable price adjusted for specific market factors such
as nature, location and condition of the properties.
Fair value adjustments and the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of
the properties and sensitivity analysis are provided in Note 9 for freehold properties
and Note 10 for leasehold properties.
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore,
it uses its incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is
the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a similar term,
and the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use
asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore reflects what the Group
‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are
available or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the
lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable inputs such as market
interest rates when available and is required to make certain entity-specific
estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year
are described below:

Impairment of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use ("ROU") assets
During the previous financial year, the Group recognised impairment losses in
respect of certain subsidiary companies’ property, plant and equipment and ROU
assets. The Group carried out the impairment test based on a variety of estimation
including the VIU of the CGU to which the property, plant and equipment and ROU
assets are allocated. Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of
the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount
rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further details of the
impairment losses recognised are disclosed in Notes 9 and 10.

asset under MFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements, based on the nature, characteristics
and risks of the properties.
Fair value of the land and buildings was determined using the market comparable
method. This means that valuations performed by the valuer are based on active market
prices, adjusted for differences in the nature, location or condition of the specific land
and buildings. As at the date of revaluations on 31 December 2023, the land and
buildings' fair value is based on valuations performed by independent professional
valuers specialising in valuing land and buildings of similar nature. A net gain of
RM3,856,000 (2022: RM1,544,000) was recognised in other comprehensive income for
the financial year ended 31 December 2023, as a result of these revaluations.
Fair value measurement disclosures for the revalued land and buildings are provided in
Note 35.
The carrying amount of certain properties pledged to licensed bank as security for bank
facilities granted to the Group as disclosed in Note 27 to the financial statements are as
follows:

The recoverable amount was estimated based on value-in-use ("VIU") and the key
assumptions to which the recoverable amount is most sensitive is disclosed below:
Impairment losses on property, plant and equipment amounting to RM387,000 (2022:
RM Nil) have been recognised during the financial year due to recoverable amounts of
property, plant and equipment in the cash generating units ("CGU"), which are
determined based on cash flow projections, are lower than their carrying amounts.
The Group has lease contracts for various items of plant, property and equipment used in its
operations. Leases of property generally have lease terms between 1 and 15 years, while
leasehold property generally have lease terms between 50 and 99 years. The Group’s
obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets. There are
several lease contracts that include extension and termination options and variable lease
payments, which are further discussed below.

Additionally, impairment loss amounting to RM914,000 has been reversed out
during the year due to re-opening of Singapore's border which improve the
performance of two Johor Bahru's outlets that has been impaired previously during
Covid-19 pandemic. This has also been determined by the cash flow projections for

The matter is now deemed closed.
Thereafter, 7EMSB filed an appeal against the dismissal of the striking out
application in the Court of Appeal which was heard on 14 March 2023. The
Court of Appeal unanimously allowed 7EMSB's appeal with costs of RM8,000.
This means that Plaintiff A's suit against 7EMSB in the High Court has been
struck out. Plaintiff A has a final appeal avenue to the Federal Court if she is
dissatisfied with the outcome. Plaintiff A will need to first obtain leave from the
Federal Court which must be made within 1 month from the day the Court of
Appeal delivered its decision. The time for the Plaintiff to file her application for
leave to appeal to the Federal Court has lapsed on 13 April 2023. 7EMSB’s
solicitors have not been served with the Plaintiff’s leave application as of to-
date.
On 26 October 2021, Plaintiff A of 7EMSB commenced an action against
7EMSB alleging, amongst others, breach of employment agreement,
negligence and harassment, claiming damages in the sum of over
RM96,032,956, as well as general damages to be assessed by the Court.
7EMSB applied for the claim to be struck out, however the High Court
dismissed the striking out application and directed the Plaintiff to amend the
Statement of Claim. On 21 April 2022, Plaintiff A amended her claim to
RM6,032,956 and for damages be assessed by the Court.

(i) Former employees of 7EMSB (cont'd.)
(b) Former employee B ("Plaintiff B")
On 11 October 2022, Plaintiff B who was a former employee of 7EMSB
commenced an action against 7EMSB alleging, amongst others, breach of
employment agreement, constructive dismissal, tort of intentional infliction of
emotional distress and tort of harassment. The claim is primarily based on
Plaintiff B being dissatisfied with the proposed restructuring exercise within the
team suggested by his superior. Plaintiff B is claiming special damages in the
sum of RM4,708,992. 7EMSB has filed its Defence on 11 November 2022 and
the Plaintiff has served his Reply to Defence on 7EMSB on 23 November
2022. The matter was fixed for full trial on 3 and 4 July 2023.
Trial fixed on 3 July 2023 has been vacated by the High Court Judge and the
Judge directed 7EMSB to file an application to strike out the claim instead.
7EMSB filed the said striking out application on 18 July 2023 as directed by
the Judge . On 7 March 2024, the High Court has found in favour of SEM's
striking out application. As such, the Plaintiff’s claim via the Writ of Summons
and Statement of Claim was struck out with costs of RM7,000. The Plaintiff
has filed his appeal to the Court of Appeal on 11 March 2024. As of to-date,
the Court of Appeal has not fixed any case management for the appeal.
The Directors of 7EMSB are of the opinion that there is a fair chance of
succeeding in their defence over the disputed claim. Accordingly, no provision
for any liability has been made in the financial statements.

The following are classes of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value and
whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value:
The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities are reasonable
approximation of fair values, either due to their short-term nature or that they are
floating rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the
reporting date.
The carrying amounts of the current and non-current portion of borrowings are
reasonable approximation of fair values due to the insignificant impact of discounting.
The fair values of current and non-current borrowings are estimated by discounting
expected future cash flows at market incremental lending rate for similar types of
lending, borrowings or leasing arrangements at the reporting date.

36. Financial risk management objectives and policies
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk concentration profile
Exposure to credit risk
The following sections provide details regarding the Group's and the Company's exposure to
the above-mentioned financial risks and the objectives, policies and processes for the
management of these risks.
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should
a counterparty default on its obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to
credit risk arises primarily from trade and sundry receivables. For other financial assets
(including cash and bank balances), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk
by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.
The Group uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of trade receivables. Any
receivables having significant balances past due or more than 60 days, which are
deemed to have higher credit risk, are monitored individually.
The Group's objective is to seek continual growth while minimising losses incurred due
to increased credit risk exposure. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing
basis.
The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from their operations and
the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, interest rate risk,
liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
It is the Group's policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken except for the use as hedging
instruments where appropriate and cost-efficient. The Group and the Company do not apply
hedge accounting.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees the policies and procedures for the management
of these risks, in order to minimise the effects of the unpredictability of the financial markets
on the performance of the Group and of the Company, which are executed by the senior
management of the Company.
The Group does not have any major concentration of credit risk related to any individual
customer or counterparty.
At the reporting date, the Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk
is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in
the statements of financial position.

(a) Credit risk (cont'd.)
Amounts due from related companies, subsidiaries and other related parties
(b) Interest rate risk
Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower, with all
other variables held constant, the Group's profit net of tax would have been
RM5,326,000 (2022: RM5,386,000) lower/higher, arising mainly as a result of
higher/lower interest income on deposits with licensed banks and interest expenses on
borrowings.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower, with all
other variables held constant, the Company's profit net of tax would have been
RM144,000 (2022: RM146,000) lower/higher, arising mainly as a result of higher/lower
interest income on deposit with licensed banks and interest expenses on borrowings
and amount due from a subsidiary company.
There is minimal risk of default as these related companies holds substantial amount of
properties, while the other related parties and subsidiary company are prospectively
profitable. The credit standing of these related companies are periodically monitored
and reviewed.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and
the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates.
The interest bearing assets made up of deposits with licensed banks. The Group and
the Company manage the interest rate risk of their deposits with licensed banks by
placing them at the most competitive interest rates obtainable, which yield better
returns than cash at bank.
Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group and the Company to cash flow interest
rate risk. Borrowings obtained at fixed rate expose the Group and the Company to fair
value interest rate risk. The Group and the Company manage their interest rate
exposure by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.

assets and liabilities. The Group's and the Company's objective is to maintain a
balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit
facilities.
The Group actively manages its operating cash flows and the availability of funding so
as to ensure that all funding needs are met. As part of its overall prudent liquidity
management, the Group maintains the availability of funding through adequate amount
of committed credit facilities.
