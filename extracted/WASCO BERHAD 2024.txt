OFFICER’S STATEMENT
DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,
Navigating a Challenging Energy Landscape
The year 2024 was one of significant momentum 
for Wasco. Despite a global economy expanding 
by just 3.2% 1 — slightly below historical trends 
and the energy industry in a transition mode, our 
performance stood out, driven by focused strategy 
and a deep commitment to long-term value creation. 
While trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties 
persisted, they catalysed structural shifts, opening 
new corridors of opportunity in new markets.
The energy sector remained a core pillar of global 
infrastructure development. More than 233,000 km 2 
of new trunk oil and gas pipelines are forecast to 
come online by 2030, ensuring continued demand 
for one of our core services: pipeline coatings. 
Concurrently, the clean energy transition is moving 
ahead, with annual investments expected to reach 
USD4 trillion 3 by decade’s end. These parallel 
forces—conventional energy expansion and the 
shift toward low-carbon alternatives—form the 
foundation of Wasco’s strategic direction.
In Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe, 
pipeline projects are surging. Southeast Asia’s GDP 
growth of 5.2% 4 bolstered demand for sustainable 
solutions, including waste-to-energy systems and 
biomass boilers. We were well-positioned to capture 
these tailwinds, owing to deliberate investments in 
capacity, innovation, and market presence.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
DATO’ SERI ROBERT TAN CHUNG MENG
Chairman
Raising the Bar: A Year of Transformation
Against this backdrop, 2024 was a 
breakthrough year for Wasco. We delivered 
our strongest financial performance to date, 
with total revenue of RM3.2 billion. Adjusted 
revenue excluding trading business grew 
by 11.9% to RM2.9 billion, and PATMI 
increasing 41.2% to RM153.0 million. These 
outcomes reflect our focus on disciplined 
execution, operational excellence, and a 
firm commitment to advancing our strategic 
priorities while delivering sustained value 
for shareholders.
In 2024, we coated over 1,000 km of 
pipelines, supporting strategic global energy 
projects such as Qatar’s critical North Field 
Expansion—one of the world’s largest gas 
developments, Rosmari Marjoram—one of 
the largest offshore pipeline and Petronas’ 
flagship Kasawari CCS Project, marking a 
significant milestone toward Malaysia’s 
decarbonisation goals. Our Engineering 
& Fabrication Services team achieved 
important milestones this year, successfully 
completing our 300th module delivery,  
which included early completion of the 
Angola FPSO project and securing our 
largest-ever engineering and fabrication 
contract, valued at USD150.0 million, 
reaffirming the industry confidence in our 
capability to deliver complex, high-value 
projects.
In the United Kingdom, in addition to 
our existing anti-corrosion facilities, our 
new concrete coating plant is now fully 
operational and strategically positions us for 
future pipeline coating projects in the region, 
including those related to carbon capture.
Expanding our global impact, we also made 
substantial progress at our key fabrication 
hubs in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
In Batam, we continued to expand  
fabrication facilities to complement our 
EPC capabilities with the expansion of 
our quayside infrastructure — effectively 
doubling our loadout capacity to 10,000 
metric tonnes to support the delivery of 
larger, more complex modules for both 
offshore and onshore energy developments. 
Spanning 36.7 hectares, the facility is 
equipped with over 19,000 m² of fabrication 
shops, a 2,160 m² exotic alloy pipe workshop, 
and 4,100 m² of covered blasting and painting 
space, reinforcing its role as a key execution 
hub within our global operations.
To increase the value proposition to our 
clients, we are investing in a 100-metre 
jetty extension (targeted for completion 
by Q2 2025), robotic cutting technology  
(Q4 2025), and a utility upgrade to 
increase power supply from 4MW to 8MW  
(Q3 2025). Strategically located within a  
Free Trade Zone (“FTZ”) and just  
40 kilometres from the nearest international 
airport, the Batam yard offers operational 
agility and cost efficiency, positioning us 
to capture emerging opportunities across 
regional and global energy markets.

---- Page 16 ----

Our facility in Dubai, located in the Jebel Ali Free 
Zone North—one of the region’s most strategic 
logistics hubs—complements our Southeast 
Asian operations. Spanning 25,000 m 2, with  
8,177 m2 of covered area, the facility is equipped 
with multiple fabrication bays, a multipurpose 
covered workshop, blasting and painting sheds, 
and ample open space for assembly. The yard is 
capable of delivering up to 10,000 metric tonnes 
of modular fabrication and pressure vessel 
manufacturing annually. Its proximity to the 
Jebel Ali Seaport, combined with its FTZ status, 
offers logistical and cost advantages, particularly 
for heavy loadouts destined for regional and 
international projects. The facility reflects our 
continued investment in operational excellence 
and our readiness to serve the growing demand 
for modular solutions across the Middle East and 
beyond.
Our Bioenergy Services division ended 2024 with 
a strong backlog of RM259.2 million—one of the 
highest order book levels to date. This significant 
pipeline reflects robust market demand and 
enhanced revenue visibility, driven by global 
momentum toward decarbonisation and 
sustainable energy solutions. With increasing 
demand for biomass boilers and waste-to-
energy systems that support Scope 1 emissions 
reduction, the division is well-positioned to scale 
and capture emerging opportunities across the 
region.
Backed by a proven track record and growing 
market relevance, our Bioenergy business has 
reached a level of maturity that supports strategic 
optionality, including potential capital market 
access. This aligns with our broader ambition to 
unlock long-term value and position the division 
as a leading player in the renewable energy 
sector.
Strengthening Market Visibility and Industry 
Engagement
Our visibility in the broader energy market 
significantly grew through active participation at 
major industry events, including the Abu Dhabi 
International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference 
(“ADIPEC”) 2024 and Offshore Technology 
Conference (“OTC”) Asia 2024. Such platforms 
have reinforced Wasco’s global brand presence, 
facilitated valuable industry dialogue, and 
opened new opportunities for partnerships and 
project engagements worldwide.
Rewarding Shareholders and Strengthening 
Investor Relations
To reward shareholders for their continued 
confidence, on 28 February 2025, we declared 
a 2 sen dividend per share—the first since 
2020. This dividend reflects prudent financial 
management during uncertain times, enabling 
strategic reinvestments to secure sustainable 
growth in future. We plan to retain adequate 
resources for the future growth of the Group 
while at the same time, reward our shareholders 
for their support through dividend payments. We 
will aim at achieving a good balance between 
efficient capital management and appropriate 
shareholders’ participation in the success of the 
Group through dividends.
Our active Investor Relations strategy further 
underscores our commitment to transparency 
and stakeholder engagement. In June, we 
successfully hosted our inaugural Investor Day, 
themed “Navigating the Future of Energy,” 
attracting over 100 investors and analysts. 
This event, which we intend to hold biennially, 
complements our ongoing participation in 
dedicated investor conferences, ensuring 
consistent communication, market visibility, and 
sustained investor confidence.

Our Bioenergy Services division ended 2024 with 
a strong backlog of RM259.2 million—one of the 
highest order book levels to date. 
This significant pipeline reflects robust market 
demand and enhanced revenue visibility, driven 
by global momentum toward decarbonisation and 
sustainable energy solutions. 
Strategic Clarity for the Future
The past year cemented Wasco’s 
transformation from a diversified group 
into a dedicated energy infrastructure 
specialist. Recognising our historical 
reliance on the oil and gas sector as a key 
challenge, we intensified efforts to diversify 
within the broader energy industry, 
proactively expanding our presence in 
energy transition and renewable solutions. 
This strategic direction, anchored in 
pipeline coatings, modular fabrication, 
and bioenergy, ensures resilience amid 
industry shifts.
Our order book stood at RM2.5 billion at 
year-end, supported by robust demand 
and improved visibility across our business 
units. Our regional presence in Southeast 
Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa 
further reinforces this resilience.
Significant progress was achieved in 
digital transformation, with enhancements 
to our Health, Safety and Environment 
(“HSE”) and ESG dashboards, Industry 
4.0 adoption, and embedding analytics 
into core systems. Long-term investments 
in Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) 
systems, automation, and advanced 
business applications laid a robust 
foundation for integrating sustainability, 
governance, and social responsibility 
throughout our organisation.
CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR/
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
While we remain consciously optimistic 
about the energy sector we are serving, the 
geopolitical and geoeconomic implications 
of ongoing tariffs and counter-tariffs 
remain uncertain. At the time of writing, the 
global business environment is becoming 
increasingly unpredictable. In light of this, 
we are committed to staying vigilant and 
ready to adapt swiftly to any changes that

We believe that one of the key goals of our 
transformation strategy—to strengthen 
our balance sheet and reinforce financial 
discipline—has positioned Wasco more 
robustly to withstand adverse market 
conditions and unexpected business shifts.

Sustainability as a Strategic Driver
Our position in the energy transition strengthened 
significantly through the launch of ASEAN’s first 
Sustainable & Transition Finance Framework (“STFF”) 
and securing a USD25.0 million sustainability-linked 
loan. These achievements align with our commitment 
to responsible financing and sustainable business 
growth.
Our approach remains grounded in globally 
recognised principles—underscoring our alignment 
with all 17 United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (“UNSDGs”) and our commitment to ethical 
governance. In December, we voluntarily joined the 
United Nations Global Compact Network Malaysia 
& Brunei (“UNGCMYB”), and have since begun

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT
embedding the Ten Principles into our operations. This 
strategic step reinforces our governance framework 
and reflects our focus on long-term, sustainable value 
creation for our shareholders.
Our ESG performance continued to gain recognition. 
We maintained our inclusion in the FTSE4Good Bursa 
Malaysia and FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia Syariah 
indices, affirming our progress in transparency and 
sustainability standards. At The Edge ESG Awards 
2024, we were honoured with two silver accolades 
—for Best Performer in the Energy Sector and Most  
Improved ESG Performance Over the Past Three Years 
(RM800 Million - RM5 Billion Market Capitalisation 
Category). Our inclusion in the 2024 Fortune 500 
Southeast Asia list further validated our strategic focus 
and growing investor confidence globally.

CHIEF FINANCIAL  
OFFICER’S REVIEW
It is an honour to connect with you as we reflect 
on Wasco’s continued financial resilience and 
robustness in the evolving energy sector. Over the 
past few years, we have focused on strengthening 
our balance sheet, ensuring financial stability, 
and enhancing our ability to navigate industry 
shifts. Through prudent capital management, cost 
optimisation, disciplined investment decisions 
and strategic divestments, we have built a solid 
foundation that positions us well for sustainable 
growth. 
Embracing Change: Innovation and Sustainable 
Growth 
The energy industry is undergoing a profound 
transformation, driven by technological 
advancements, regulatory shifts, and an increasing 
commitment to sustainability. As the sector adapts 
to these changes, Wasco remains proactive in 
seizing new opportunities, refining our strategies, 
and leveraging innovation to enhance resilience. 
Our focus on financial strength, operational 
efficiency, and strategic investments enables us 
to capitalise on emerging trends while ensuring 
long-term profitability. We continue to embrace 
digitalisation and energy transition initiatives to 
drive efficiency and expand our market presence. 
Through these efforts, we are committed to 
delivering sustainable value for our stakeholders, 
reinforcing our role as a trusted leader in the energy 
sector.
Robust Profitability
We are thrilled to have delivered a stellar 
performance in FY2024, with the Group comfortably 
surpassing our FY2023 results and exceeding 
analysts’ consensus.
Our Profit After Tax and Minority Interest (“PATMI”) 
surged by 41.2% in 2024 to RM153.0 million, 
despite recognising net one-off charges amounting 
to RM29.1 million, a record high for the Group. 
This outstanding achievement was primarily driven 
by higher revenue contributions with improved 
margins, alongside profit contributions from joint 
ventures. The successful execution of high-value 
projects across the energy and renewable energy 
sectors further solidified our position as a leader in 
sustainable and value-driven solutions.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Our core profits stood at RM182.1 million, 
markedly exceeding the full-year consensus 
of RM144.0 million, and we improved both 
our Return on Equity and Return on Capital 
Employed, reinforcing our dedication to 
sustainable growth and shareholder value 
creation. 
In light of the achievements above, for the 
fiscal year 2024, the Group announced and 
distributed dividends of 2 sen per share, 
amounting to a total of approximately RM15.5 
million. It is noteworthy that the previous 
dividend payment occurred in fiscal year 
2020, subsequently, we concentrated on 
strengthening our financial foundations. 
Strategic Revenue Growth & Business 
Restructuring
In FY2024, our revenue recorded a high 
of RM3.2 billion, including approximately 
RM269.9 million from our trading business 
(previously categorised as “Asset Held for 
Sale”). After eliminating the contribution 
from our trading business, our adjusted 
revenue of RM2.9 billion was a respectable 
11.9% higher compared to FY2023. This 
increase was primarily driven by a surge in 
project execution activities during the year, 
despite both domestic and global economic 
uncertainties and industry challenges.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Exit of Trading Business
In line with the Group’s business 
rationalisation strategy, the Group had 
decided to exit the trading business. This 
involved the divestment of WDG Resources 
Sdn. Bhd. (“WDG”) and Syn Tai Hung 
Trading Sdn. Bhd. (“STHT”), with active 
efforts to secure buyers for both entities. 
By 30 June 2024, the Group entered into 
an agreement for the disposal of WDG 
through the sale of 1,200,000 ordinary 
shares and 4,800,000 redeemable 
preference shares, representing 60% 
and 80% ownership, respectively, for 
a total consideration of approximately 
RM731,000. This disposal resulted in WDG 
and its subsidiaries ceasing to be part of 
the Group’s operations. 
WDG remained classified under 
discontinued operations in the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss of 
the Group for part of the year. 
For STHT, despite efforts to identify a 
suitable buyer, no viable offers were 
received. Consequently, in November 
2024, the Group opted to proceed with the 
liquidation of STHT instead of disposal. 
Therefore, for the financial year ended 31 
December 2024, STHT was reclassified 
under continuing operations.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Over the five-year period, the Group’s profitability 
also underwent a significant turnaround. In FY2024, 
the Group recorded a Profit Before Taxation (“PBT”) 
and PATMI of RM221.1 million and RM153.0 million, 
respectively, a testament to our resilience and effective 
business strategies, as we increased our exposure into 
other areas within the energy sector. 
Energy Services
Our Energy Services division achieved strong growth, 
with revenue increasing 12.6% to RM2.6 billion from 
RM2.3 billion in FY2023, driven by a surge in project 
activities. Key milestones for our Pipeline Services unit 
include the completion of 570 kilometres of pipeline 
coating for Qatar’s North Field Expansion Project and 139 
kilometres of coated pipelines for Malaysia’s Kasawari 
CCS Project, supporting national decarbonisation 
efforts. Additionally, 220 kilometres of pipelines were 
coated for the Rosmari-Marjoram Project, enhancing 
regional gas production. 
Our Engineering & Fabrication Services unit reached 
a significant milestone with the 300 th  module loadout  
from Batam, successfully delivering ahead of schedule  
for the Angola FPSO project. Additionally, some notable 
projects secured by our Engineering & Fabrication 
Services unit include a substation project in the 
Middle East, Engineering, Procurement, Construction 
and Commissioning (“EPCC”) for power generation 
assets in Australia, and EPCC and maintenance of 
gas compression units in Indonesia. All of this further 
bolster the Group’s market expansion strategy and 
strengthens its position as a trusted industry leader. 
Bioenergy Services
Our Bioenergy Services division recorded revenue of 
RM276.7 million, a slight decline from the previous year 
due to softer demand. This is in line with the natural 
plantation cycle, which had followed an exceptional 
year in 2023. Despite this, the division remains resilient, 
with contributions from after-sales services growing 
from 28% to 34% in 2024. To date, it has successfully 
sold a total of 1,764 turbine units, unlocking significant 
opportunities for growth through its expanding after-
sales services.
Additionally, it is worth noting that the division is also 
looking to strategically invest in the growing industrial 
boiler segment to support corporate decarbonisation 
efforts and capitalise on the industrial sector’s gradual 
transition toward cleaner energy solutions.
Cost Management & Financial Efficiency
As mentioned, the Group had recorded, excluding the 
trading business, an adjusted revenue of RM2.9 billion 
in FY2024, an increase of 11.9% from the prior year. 
Nonetheless, the increase in revenue did not directly 
align with the percentage increase in PBT, largely due 
to the net one-off charges totalling approximately 
RM29.1 million for the fiscal year. Excluding these, the 
Group would have reported a PBT of RM250.2 million 
for FY2024, reflecting robust growth of 14.6%, which 
was higher compared to the Group’s adjusted revenue.
Finance costs saw a more modest decline of only 10.4%, 
despite total debt reduction by 25.2%. This disparity 
is primarily attributed to two key factors. Firstly, a 
significant portion of the Group’s loans are denominated 
in USD, which carries a higher interest rate. Secondly, 
loan repayments were made progressively throughout 
the year. Consequently, the reduction in the Group’s 
total debt did not translate into a proportional decrease 
in finance costs.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation
The Group achieved a notable reduction in total debt attributed to our 
strong operating cash flow. The Group repaid net debt of approximately 
RM221.9 million over the year. This reduced the Group’s net gearing to 
RM173.0 million as of December 2024, improving our net gearing ratio 
significantly from 0.48x in 2023 to 0.21x. Naturally, our cash and bank 
balances decreased to RM352.5 million as of FY2024, from RM410.3 
million in the prior year.
This proactive capital management approach aims to lower interest 
expenses and provide greater financial flexibility for our future needs. 
Additionally, it mitigates the risk of financial strain under adverse 
economic conditions, enhancing our financial resilience. As a result, the 
Group now enjoys stronger financial control, strength, and flexibility. 
Capital Expenditure (“CAPEX”) for FY2024 saw the Group maintain a 
similar level of spending compared to the previous year. CAPEX was 
incurred primarily for the upgrading of our Engineering and Fabrication 
yard in Batam, Indonesia, and the acquisition of additional plant and 
machinery assets for our Qatar and UK plants. Looking ahead, the Group 
does not expect CAPEX for 2025 to deviate significantly vis-à-vis 2024. 
Equity Market 
In 2024, despite global headwinds such as potential US trade tariffs and policies that raised fears of supply chain 
disruptions negatively impacting emerging market equities, the Malaysian capital market remained resilient and 
orderly without any observed systemic stability concerns. The Securities Commission reported that the Malaysian 
capital market hit an all-time high of RM4.2 trillion in 2024 (2023: RM3.8 trillion), driven by the growth in stock 
market capitalisation and bonds and sukuk outstanding. 1

Economic Outlook
At the point of writing, global economic growth is 
expected to stay below pre-pandemic trends, despite 
showing remarkable resilience, with growth projected 
at 2.8% in 2025, the same as in 2024. According to Bank 
Negara Malaysia, Malaysia capped off a positive year 
with the economy recording 5.1% growth in 2024, well 
ahead of 3.7% growth attained in 2023. This growth 
momentum is expected to be sustained in the near 
term, with growth projected at 4.7% in 2025. 4
In conclusion, as the global economy continues its 
recovery, 2025 is expected to bring moderate growth,  
supported by easing inflationary pressures. However, the 
business landscape will require careful navigation amid 
ongoing recalibrations across geopolitical, economic, 
and technological fronts. In this dynamic environment,  
the Group remains committed to executing its strategic 
initiatives that drive long-term value creation. 
Ramanathan Singaram
Chief Financial Officer
Wasco Berhad
Wasco’s share price was actively traded and rallied 
during the second quarter to a high of RM1.57 from 
RM1.00 at the beginning of the year. We believe that 
this has coincided with the series of commendable 
result announcements for Q4 FY2023 and Q1 FY2024. 
However, the second half of the year had seen our 
share price shedding the gains, suffering a similar fate 
with other energy counters on Bursa Malaysia, closing 
the year at RM1.02.
Wasco’s stock is covered by 6 research houses, and 
as at 3 March 2025, we have 5 BUY calls and 1 HOLD

CHIEF STRATEGY 
OFFICER’S STATEMENT
Dear Valued Stakeholders,
At Wasco, sustainability is more than an operational imperative—it guides our strategic decisions, 
operational priorities, and how we deliver lasting value. As we reflect on 2024, I am pleased to 
present our Sustainability Report (“SR”), which captures the commitment, transparency, progress, 
and tangible impact delivered by our dedicated teams across Wasco.
PROGRESSING TOWARD NET ZERO AMID  
INCREASED ACTIVITIES 
Throughout 2024, we continued to advance steadily toward 
our goal of achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
2026. While heightened operational activities—particularly 
at our Qatar facility—led to an increase in total emissions 
this year, amounting to 44,780 tCO 2e of Scope 1 and 2 
emissions, we responded proactively by strengthening 
our emissions management strategies and preparing for 
renewable energy expansion.
In 2025, we plan to install new solar infrastructure at key 
sites, including Kuantan, Shah Alam, Kota Kinabalu, and 
Batam. 
Our renewable energy reliance remained steady at 27%, 
supported by ongoing solar power generation exceeding 
1,120 MWh and our continued subscription to Tenaga 
Nasional’s Green Electricity Tariff.
RAISING THE BAR IN ESG 
In 2024, we significantly raised the bar in our ESG 
commitments, reinforcing our accountability and 
credibility across key sustainability areas. With the launch 
of the National Sustainability Reporting Framework 
(“NSRF”), we conducted a gap analysis of our SR against 
the NSRF requirements. Where possible, we have begun 
incorporating these requirements in our current SR.
GOVERNANCE
Through rigorous internal reviews, audits and independent 
third-party assurances, we strengthened the accuracy 
and transparency of our critical ESG metrics, including 
renewable energy usage, greenhouse gas emissions 
(Scope 1 and 2), water management, energy consumption, 
and occupational safety.
Our Board Sustainability Committee provided diligent 
oversight throughout the year, reviewing our ESG 
strategies and ensuring their alignment with IFRS S2 
climate-related disclosure standards, further enhancing 
our overall sustainability accountability.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
ADVANCING 
SUSTAINABILITY 
WITH PURPOSE AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY
SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION FINANCE 
FRAMEWORK 
In a pioneering move, Wasco introduced 
ASEAN’s first Sustainable Transition  
Finance Framework, strategically integrating 
our financial and sustainability objectives. 
Under this innovative framework, we secured 
a USD25.0 million sustainability-linked 
loan, with an initial drawdown of USD10.0 
million specifically supporting sustainability-
driven infrastructure improvements at our 
Batam yard. This groundbreaking initiative 
reinforces our accountability, positioning 
Wasco as a regional frontrunner in sustainable finance.
CIRCULARITY MOVEMENT 
We accelerated our circular economy efforts in 2024, 
achieving significant waste reduction through impactful 
recycling initiatives. Notably, we transformed polyethylene 
and polypropylene waste from our coating processes 
into reusable resin, slashing purging material costs by 
81.0%. Additionally, our active participation in community 
recycling programmes saw us transforming plastic bottle 
waste into textiles and collecting over 205 kg of electronic 
waste, underscoring our commitment to responsible 
resource use and waste reduction.
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND SAFETY EXCELLENCE
We continued fostering strong community engagement, 
investing approximately RM0.8 million in impactful 
initiatives that benefited nearly to 12,000 individuals across 
Southeast Asia and East Africa. These activities received 
the active support of our employees, who collectively 
contributed approximately 11,800 volunteer man-hours.
Safety remained paramount as we achieved an 
exceptional Lost Time Incident Rate of 0.05, significantly  
outperforming industry benchmarks for the year.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
Female representation in our senior leadership remained 
steady at 14%, with an aspirational target of 30%. To 
support this goal, we have ongoing initiatives to further 
advance diversity and inclusion across our organisation, 
including key events planned in 2025.
REFORESTATION PROJECT 
In 2024, we closely monitored the growth and health 
of Wasco Forest – our first reforestation project – and 
conducted an extensive soil carbon stock study to 
accurately quantify carbon sequestration. We are pleased 
to report that the 160,000 trees planted in 2022 are  
thriving. Building on these insights, we are preparing 
the next phase of our reforestation programme on newly 
designated land awarded to us by the Pahang Forestry 
Department for this initiative. Our target is to plant  
110,000 trees in 2025, advancing toward our ultimate goal 
of replanting 1 million trees.
These focused actions contribute meaningfully towards 
global sustainability goals, especially SDG 12 (Responsible 
Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), 
and SDG 15 (Life on Land).
INDUSTRY RECOGNITION AND ESG ACHIEVEMENTS 
Our continuous ESG advancements received external 
validation through two prestigious silver awards at The 
Edge Malaysia ESG Awards 2024: Best in Energy Sector 
and Most Improved ESG Performance Over the Past Three 
Years (RM800 Million - RM5 Billion Market Capitalisation 
Category). Additionally, our FTSE ESG rating improved 
from 4.0 to 4.1, reaffirming our commitment to globally 
recognised sustainability standards while strengthening 
stakeholder confidence, investor trust, and our corporate 
reputation.
LOOKING AHEAD: FROM STRATEGY TO STEWARDSHIP
As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, we are determined 
to continue deepening our sustainability efforts. We will 
further enhance our transparency through expanding our 
Scope 3 emissions disclosures, providing greater insight 
into our overall environmental footprint. We will also embed 
more circular economy practices into our operations to 
promote resource efficiency and responsible consumption. 
In addition, we will continue to strengthen our sustainable 
procurement engagements, fostering ethical sourcing 
and responsible partnerships across our value chain. 
We will concurrently undertake our first comprehensive 
double materiality assessment to strategically align our 
sustainability priorities with long-term business resilience. 
This initiative will ensure that our approach effectively 
addresses both stakeholder expectations and core business 
imperatives.
We also intend to expand our decarbonisation partnerships 
beyond our core infrastructure services. With the successful 
pilot initiative with Hydra Energy in 2024, we will continue 
to evaluate the potential to scale this model, a key step in 
expanding our role in the low-carbon mobility ecosystem. 
Diversity and inclusion remain integral to our mission. 
We are strengthening our focus on gender equality and 
inclusive leadership with the formalisation of the Wasco 
Women Action Network, which will serve to drive visibility, 
advancement, and advocacy for women across Wasco. 
Related to this is our commitment to human rights, which 
we will continue to reinforce through enhanced risk 
mapping, supplier due diligence, and targeted awareness 
programmes, ensuring our global footprint upholds the 
highest ethical standards at all times. 
Last but not least, to elevate transparency and investor 
confidence, we will incorporate climate-change scenario 
analyses into our climate-related disclosures, thereby 
aligning ourselves with emerging global expectations 
under IFRS S2. As we embed these commitments into our 
strategic roadmap, we reaffirm our dedication to leading 
with purpose, accountability and long-term vision. 
At Wasco, sustainability is not a one-time ambition, but a 
continuous journey of listening, learning, and leading with 
purpose. Through strategic clarity and collective resolve, 
we will continue to create a meaningful impact within our 
business and beyond.
Thank you for your continued trust and partnership.

Sustainability Policy
At Wasco, sustainability is about delivering value 
for all our stakeholders in a responsible manner, 
balancing short and long-term interests that 
integrates economic, environment and social 
considerations into our business strategy. Wherever 
possible, we will implement and maintain accredited 
management systems for corporate sustainability to 
drive performance and improvement by focusing on 
our business processes, our culture, and our digital
agenda – all underpinned by a strong governance 
structure.
To achieve these goals, we will:
• Ensure that our safety values remain a top priority, 
ensuring that nobody gets hurt, no damage to 
property and no harm to the environment.
• Generate financial gains aligned to the needs of 
our stakeholders.
• Employ a diverse workforce and provide a work 
environment where everyone is treated fairly, with 
respect, avoid excessive working hours, given the 
right to a minimum wage and can realise their full 
potential.
• Implement actions within our own business and 
other stakeholders to accelerate the transition to 
net-zero emissions to reduce the impact of climate 
change.
• Manage our businesses efficiently through 
embracing digitalisation and innovation.
• Conduct our business in an ethical and transparent 
manner.
• Safeguard human rights within our sphere of 
influence, opposing all forms of child labour and 
forced labour.
• Support employment of underprivileged groups 
and youth.
• Contribute to the well-being of local communities 
wherever we operate.
• Periodically review our performance and 
implement appropriate actions for continuous 
improvement.
In implementing this Policy, we will support 
and advance the United Nation’s Sustainable 
Development Goals focusing our efforts on those 
that align with our aims in order to make the most 
impactful contribution.
We will engage with our employees, contractors, 
suppliers, customers, and business partners in 
sharing responsibility for meeting these goals.
Sustainability considerations are embedded in 
our corporate strategy to ensure long-term value 
creation and sustainable business growth. We 
regularly review our sustainability approach 
and priorities to meet evolving stakeholder  
expectations and enhance our value creation 
efforts.
Our Sustainability Framework reflects our 
commitment to integrating sustainability into the 
core of our business. This aligns with the growing 
call for corporate organisations to take a more 
active role in advancing sustainability and to look 
beyond short-term profitability.
Guided by our purpose, the Sustainability 
Framework was developed by taking into 
consideration the varying maturity levels across 
Wasco. The process involved assessing existing 
sustainability programmes, aligning with 
changing in regulatory requirements, and setting 
measurable targets and goals to track our impact.
The following factors were taken into consideration:
1. Material matters identified through a robust 
materiality assessment involving our Board 
of Directors, Senior Leadership Team, and key 
stakeholders.
2. Ongoing engagement with BUs on pertinent 
sustainability issues.
3. Internal assessments and benchmarking 
against industry peers.
4. Monitoring and evaluation of key performance 
indicators.
Additionally, our Framework aligns with the global 
sustainable development agenda, particularly the 
UN SDGs, supporting a shared vision for a better 
and more inclusive future that leaves no one 
behind.

GS leads the development of the overarching 
strategy and framework to drive sustainability 
initiatives and programmes across Wasco 
in a structured and cohesive manner. Their 
responsibilities include monitoring and managing 
business sustainability practices and targets, 
keeping abreast of the evolving sustainability 
landscape, and ensuring the assessment and 
measurement of Wasco’s sustainability risks 
and opportunities. The team also provides 
advisory support and capacity building for the 
sustainability teams across all BUs and regularly 
receives sustainability progress updates.
Board Level
Wasco’s Board holds ultimate responsibility for Wasco’s sustainability agenda, overseeing the integration 
of sustainability matters into the corporate strategy with the aim of balancing stakeholder interests while 
ensuring that we grow responsibly and create long-term value.
Board Sustainability Committee (“BSC”)
The BSC (formerly known as Governance, Compliance and Risk Committee) was established in 2023 to 
strengthen Board oversight on sustainability issues across Wasco. This initiative underscores our top-down 
approach and reinforces our commitment to making sustainability a Wasco-wide priority. The BSC also 
oversees climate-related matters, including risks and opportunities.
The BSC comprises a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director and two Independent Non-Executive 
Directors, with the Committee being chaired by an Independent Non-Executive Director.
The BSC met four times in the year under review to discuss various matters, including:
• Reviewing Wasco’s sustainability performance and activities.
• Recommending enhancements to the SR.
• Discussing the Transition Finance Framework.
• Evaluating the requirements and adoption of IFRS S1 and S2.
Management Level
The overall management responsibility and 
oversight of sustainability-related matters lies 
with our Managing Director/Group CEO. The 
Managing Director/Group CEO is supported by the 
Group Chief Strategy Officer, who oversees GS, 
along with other Senior Management members 
responsible for their respective areas.
To ensure accountability, sustainability-related 
KPIs are integrated into the annual remuneration-
linked KPIs of our Managing Director/Group CEO 
as well as BUs’ Senior Leadership Teams. The 
CEOs of all BUs are also authorised to sign off on 
sustainability-related governance matters as part 
of our internal control assurance process.
Sustainability Steering Committee (“SSC”)
Chaired by the Managing Director/Group 
Chief Executive Officer, the SSC consists of 
representatives from GS and selected Heads or 
nominees from key corporate functions. The SSC 
is responsible for supporting the management of 
sustainability matters and ensuring collaboration 
to streamline Wasco’s approach, and promoting 
the sharing of best practices across the 
organisation.

ensure their 
continued

MANAGING OUR MATERIAL MATTERS
Materiality assessments are integral to our sustainability journey, as they enable us to evaluate the sustainability 
issues that affect our business and our stakeholders. We conduct a materiality assessment once every two years to 
ensure that our focus remains relevant and aligned with evolving sustainability trends, industry developments and 
regulatory shifts. It also allows us to identify opportunities and mitigate risks associated with each material matter.
In 2023, we re-evaluated our material sustainability issues following the consolidation of BUs under Wasco. This 
reassessment ensures that our material matters reflect current priorities and continue to inform our business 
strategy and long-term value creation for stakeholders. Importantly, we undertake this review even in the absence 
of significant internal or external changes, reaffirming our commitment to industry best practices.
The following infographic outlines the key steps in our materiality assessment process.

Stakeholder Groups Participating in the Survey
Shareholders & Investors
Employees
Media
Customers
Vendors & Suppliers
Regulators & Authorities
The survey invited stakeholder representatives to rate the importance of 18 sustainability topics.
Respondents evaluated each area using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘very unimportant’ (1) to ‘very important’ 
(5), with (3) representing the neutral midpoint. The survey yielded 298 responses from both internal and external 
stakeholders.
As expected, there was a natural skew in representation, with the highest number of responses from employees, 
and fewer from Regulators & Authorities and the Media.
To address this imbalance, we calculated the average score for each topic within individual stakeholder groups, 
and subsequently derived an overall average rating across all eight stakeholder groups.
Members of our Senior Leadership Team and Board also participated in the survey, with their responses representing 
Wasco’s perspective.
Materiality Matrix
To interpret the results, we considered scores above 3 as indicating medium to high importance. Stakeholder 
scores ranged from 4.06 to 4.74, while Wasco’s scores ranged from 3.69 to 4.77, indicating that all identified issues 
were considered material to some degree. Based on this, we adopted a “material to very material” scale for our 
matrix, which is presented in the following diagram.
Health, Safety and Environment remained the top material matter for both Wasco and our stakeholders. In addition, 
stakeholders highlighted other key priorities, including Product Quality, Labour Practices, Human Rights, Waste 
Management, Training & Development, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion—all of which will require Wasco’s 
focused attention.
Building on our current progress, we will evolve our materiality assessment in 2025 by fully integrating double 
materiality principles, strengthening our proactive and adaptive sustainability approach. Our next steps include 
deepening stakeholder engagement, refining our sustainability priorities in response to emerging trends, and 
strengthening our reporting frameworks to enhance transparency and accountability. By doing so, we aim to drive 
long-term resilience and sustainable growth across our operations.

At Wasco, we acknowledge the growing impact of sustainability-related risks on our operations, supply chains, 
and stakeholders. Our Risk Management Strategy is crafted to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate these risks, 
safeguarding business resilience and fostering long-term sustainability.
The strategy follows a structured five-step risk management process, aligned with ISO 31000:2018 as depicted 
below:
At present, sustainability represents one of five risk categories at Wasco. Within this category, there are four areas 
of focus: Economic, Environmental, Social, and Governance.

Sustainability-related risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and managed using Wasco’s Risk 
Management Framework, in alignment with how all other risks are addressed. The Board and Senior Management 
actively consider, review, and monitor these risks and opportunities as part of our strategic planning, investment 
decisions, and regular financial and operational performance reviews throughout the year.
Key Risks Key Opportunities
By proactively addressing sustainability risks and capitalisng on emerging opportunities, we can enhance our 
resilience, drive innovation, and strengthen stakeholder trust, ultimately securing long-term success. Hence, by 
integrating sustainability into our business strategies, we can navigate uncertainties, enhance our competitiveness, 
and contribute to a more sustainable future.
Environmental: Climate change, resource scarcity, 
and stricter regulations can disrupt operations and 
increase costs.
Environmental: Investing in renewable energy, 
sustainable sourcing, and circular economy practices 
can reduce costs, mitigate risks, and strengthen 
brand value.
Social: Workplace safety concerns changing 
consumer expectations, and lack of diversity can 
harm reputation and employee engagement.
Social: Strong labour practices, ethical sourcing, and 
inclusive branding can improve employee retention 
and customer loyalty.
Governance: Evolving regulations require adaptive 
approaches. ESG non-compliance, unethical 
conduct, and cybersecurity threats can lead to legal 
and financial consequences.
Governance: Transparent reporting, ethical business 
conduct, and data-driven decision-making can attract 
investors, enhance governance credibility, and 
ensure regulatory compliance.
Financial: Rising compliance costs, investor 
divestment, and supply chain disruptions can impact 
profitability.
Financial: Access to green financing, efficiency 
improvements, and long-term value creation 
through sustainability initiatives can boost financial 
performance.
Market: Changing consumer demand for low-carbon 
products can lead to stranded assets and increased 
business risks.
Market: Sustainability-driven innovation and 
transition initiatives open new market and job 
opportunities in the green economy.
Technology: High upfront costs of low-carbon 
technologies pose transition challenges for carbon-
intensive operations.
Stakeholder: Collaborating with business partners 
and leveraging Wasco’s sustainability leadership 
enhances project execution and emission reduction 
efforts.

G GOVERNANCE (INTEGRITY, COMPLIANCE, ASSURANCE 
AND REPORTING CONCERNS) 
Wasco’s commitment in ensuring that integrity and compliance are observed in the day-to- day business  
operations, are pillars to a sustainable foundation of our culture and a business priority. We set high expectations  
to all our employees as outlined in our Principles of Business Conduct. These vital values of integrity and  
compliance are the fundamentals to good governance.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption
Wasco’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”) and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Management 
System (“ABMS”) together with its 24 Standard Operating Procedures (“24 SOPs”) established on 1 June 2020 
and 1 December 2020 respectively are testimony of the Company’s initiatives and commitment towards an 
organisation that are integrity and compliant oriented. These fundamentals have been deeply rooted into the 
business perspective and in its corporate culture. Wasco adopted a zero-tolerance approach against all forms 
of bribery and corruption, such as fraud and illegal kickbacks. Wasco’s ABC Policy sets the tone and standards 
on anti-bribery and corruption across the Group while the ABMS together with its 24 SOPs communicate its 
comprehensive approaches and processes in deterring, mitigating and addressing corruption risks including 
bribery, fraud and corrupt acts. Wasco’s ABMS and its 24 SOPS are aligned to SIRIM ISO 37001:2016 standards 
and are the best practices as prescribed under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009  
(Amendment 2018) (“MACC Act”). Wasco’s ABC Policy fulfils the provisions of the Guidelines on Adequate 
Procedures pursuant to Section 17A (5) of the MACC Act.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
The ABC Policy applies to the Board of Directors and 
employees within Wasco. Majority of the employee 
completed the necessary initial training on anti-bribery 
and corruption as well as yearly awareness or refresher 
trainings pertaining to the same.
The Board of Directors oversees our compliance with 
ABC Policy and the ABMS together with its 24 SOPS via 
the Governance, Compliance and Risk Committee and 
the Integrity Committee accordingly. Every employee is 
responsible for preventing and reporting instances of 
corruption, bribery, suspicious activity or wrongdoing 
which may lead to bribery and corruption using our 
established whistleblowing channels.
Wasco recorded zero case related to bribery and 
corruption and received no (RM0) penalties due to 
ethical conduct breaches such as corruption during the 
year under review.
A keen understanding of corruption risk exposure is the 
foundation of an effective anti-corruption compliance 
programme. Corruption risks, including bribery, are 
important elements in the BUs risk register.
This keen understanding helps the Company design 
effective mitigation strategies and strategically deploy 
resources to combat potential bribery, corruption and 
fraud, especially for high-risk operations.
Contractors, subcontractors and third parties are 
subject to corruption and bribery risk assessments and 
must declare they are not involved in any misconduct 
or corrupt, unethical and illegal behaviour. Wasco 
communicates its anti-corruption policy clearly to these 
intermediaries.
Communicating our Company’s position on anti-bribery 
and corruption to all stakeholders:
• Employees are given an introduction to our anti-
bribery and corruption policy upon joining the 
Company.
• Each employee must sign the ABC Personnel 
Declaration and return to the Human Resources 
Department.
• Employees are reminded of our Company’s 
opposition to corruption during regular engagement 
sessions and training via iLearn
• The anti-corruption policy is also communicated to 
suppliers, contractors, subcontractors, agents, joint 
venture companies and third parties.
Wasco also screens new and existing business partners 
for corruption and bribery, which is part of due diligence 
in Wasco’s compliance requirements.
Business books and records reflect all business dealings 
accurately and transparently. Wasco introduced 
monitoring and enforcement procedures to ensure 
compliance with anti-corruption laws in Malaysia. 
Wasco did not make any political contributions in 2024 
(RM0).
No major disciplinary cases were reported for corrupt 
practices that resulted in employees’ dismissal. There 
were no instances of corruption-related violations with 
our business associates. We have received zero fines 
and penalties from the authorities during the recent 
years and reporting period, which demonstrates the 
effectiveness of our stringent anti-corruption policies 
and practices.
Anti-Money Laundering
The Anti-Money Laundering Policy was established on 
28 November 2024. This indicates another milestone 
of Wasco’s commitment in adhering to high ethical 
standards of business conduct in order to combat money 
laundering and terrorism financing within Wasco.
This policy complements and to be read in conjunction 
with the ABC Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy 
amongst other relevant policies.
Whistleblowing
Wasco’s whistleblowing policy applies to all employees 
and external parties who have business relationships 
with the Group. Our Whistleblowing Policy is aligned 
with the ISO 37001:2016 Clause 8.9 Raising Concern. 
Individuals raising concerns or reporting possible 
violations of the Code of Conduct in good faith are:
• Protected from any forms of retaliation; and
• Treated with the utmost confidentiality.
Whistle-blowers are encouraged to raise their concerns 
and report to the Managing Director/Group Chief 
Executive Officer, Gian Carlo Maccagno or to the 
Chairman of Audit Committee, Datin Wan Daneena Liza 
Binti Wan Abdul Rahman, confidentially. Senior officers 
have been trained to handle these reports, corruption, 
harassment, bribery, financial irregularity and other 
offences.

recognises its critical role in powering both global and 
local economies. We take this responsibility seriously, 
knowing that the economic performance of businesses 
like ours significantly influences the well-being of 
communities and the broader economy.
As a key player in the global energy infrastructure, 
we are committed to breaking down barriers to clean, 
affordable energy, making it accessible to everyone, 
everywhere. Through our diverse business activities, 
we not only fuel industries and economies, but also 
generate meaningful, long-term positive impact.
Through our business activities, we drive economic 
growth and generate positive impacts. This influence is 
seen in various ways: 
• creating job opportunities that enhance livelihoods
• contributing taxes that support infrastructure and 
public services
• providing products and services that benefit 
communities.
We fully recognise the wide-ranging economic 
benefits of our actions and their significant 
impact on stakeholders and sectors within our 
community. By highlighting these outcomes, we 
aim to showcase the diverse value created by our 
initiatives:
1. Value Delivered to Shareholders: Delivering 
strong financial returns and growth 
opportunities for investors.
2. Value through Products and Services to the 
Nation: Contributing to national economic 
development through essential goods and 
services.
3. Competitive Compensation for Employees: 
Offering attractive salaries and benefits that 
support employee well-being and retention.
4. Fulfillment of Obligations to Suppliers and

stakeholders.
5. Investment Benefits for Local Communities: 
Driving community growth and development

6. Meeting Customer Needs: Exceeding 
customer expectations to foster long-term 
satisfaction and loyalty.
In 2024, we generated a direct economic value of 
RM3.2 billion in revenue (with RM2.9 billion in adjusted 
revenue). Our economic impact also extends to our role 
as a global employer. At the end of 2024, we employed 
approximately 5,854 employees and offered fair and 
competitive wages and benefits. Wasco recorded a 
Profit after Tax, Minority Interest (“PATMI”) of RM153.0 
million for the financial year ended 31 December 
2024 (FY2024), an 41.2% increase from the RM108.4 
million reported in the previous financial year ended 
31 December 2023 (FY2023). The growth in PATMI is 
attributed to higher operating revenue by 11.9% to 
RM2.9 billion from RM2.6 billion in FY2023. 
At Wasco, we comply with tax regulations in the 
countries where we operate. We believe that this is our 
responsibility to our stakeholders in upholding good 
tax practices. 
At Wasco, we provide our stakeholders with a

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
To uphold these principles, we conduct both quantitative 
and qualitative annual assessments of all suppliers 
listed on our Approved Vendor List (“AVL”). Suppliers 
are categorised into Major and Minor Vendors, and their 
performance is systematically reviewed to identify risks 
and drive improvements.
Suppliers that do not meet our standards are formally 
notified and required to implement corrective actions. 
Failure to comply or improve may result in suspension 
or removal from the AVL. We also update our Supplier 
Audit Matrix annually to reflect the outcomes of these 
assessments and ensure ongoing alignment with our 
procurement goals.
Expanding Scope 3 Emissions Tracking
In line with our environmental commitments and efforts 
to track Scope 3 GHG emissions, Wasco launched a pilot 
programme with selected vendors. The initiative aimed 
to raise awareness and build capacity on emissions 
management within our supply chain.
During the programme, vendors received briefings on 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions tracking methodologies and 
were guided on managing their own direct and indirect 
GHG emissions. Together, we developed emission factors 
specific to the products and services supplied to Wasco, 
establishing a foundation for more accurate Scope 3 
assessments.
Looking ahead, we aim to:
• Enhance the accuracy and consistency of our vendors’ 
emissions data;
• Encourage our vendors’ emissions reduction initiatives; 
and
• Expand the engagement programme to include more 
vendors.
Sustainability-Linked Loan
Wasco has established a Sustainable & Transition 
Finance Framework, the first of its kind in ASEAN,  
and successfully executed its inaugural 
Sustainability-Linked Loan (“SLL”), of USD25.0 
million under this Framework. Wasco has drawn 
down USD10.0 million as at 31 December 2024 to 
finance capital expenditures for our yard expansion 
in Batam, Indonesia.

E
Given the urgent global imperative to address climate change, it is crucial to take proactive measures to mitigate 
its effects and prevent irreversible damage to both the environment and humanity. The widespread consequences 
of climate change—such as extreme weather, resource shortages, and shifting regulations—pose significant risks 
to supply chains and can drive up operational costs. These challenges threaten Wasco’s ability to create long-
term value for our business and stakeholders, impacting our performance, reputation, supply chain resilience, and 
overall sustainability. As such, integrating climate considerations into our decision-making processes is not just a 
necessity, but a fundamental priority.
Wasco is committed to 
providing high-quality 
services that protect 
and improve the 
environment. 
60% 
of our Environmental 
Management System is 
ISO14001 certified  
as of 2024.
Failing to address climate change exposes us to a host of potential risks,  
including stranded assets, short-sighted business strategies, operational 
disruptions, and reputational harm. Additionally, the growing trend of financial 
institutions incorporating climate-related criteria into their lending and 
investment decisions may limit our access to capital, leading to higher financing 
costs. The rise of carbon pricing mechanisms, with calls for a global carbon 
price, further highlights the importance of adapting our business models to 
avoid significant financial repercussions. Proactively addressing climate change 
is therefore essential—not only for mitigating environmental risks, but also for 
safeguarding our financial resilience, strengthening our competitive edge, and 
ensuring long-term success.
Wasco’s commitment to practising environmental sustainability is a continuous 
process. We align our environmental policy and practices with environmental 
laws and legislations, including strategies to prevent pollution, minimise waste 
and conserve natural resources where we operate. We received no environmental 
fines and penalties during the year. 
Our Approach
Environmental 
Assessment
Conduct a comprehensive assessment of environmental issues directly related to 
our operations. This evaluation will identify key areas where our activities impact the 
environment, such as resource consumption, emissions, water consumption and waste 
generation.
Data-Driven 
Tracking and 
Monitoring
Establish robust tracking and monitoring routines to collect relevant data. This 
information will serve as the foundation for developing measurable targets. By tracking 
our environmental performance consistently, we can make timely and informed 
decisions and measure our progress effectively.
Strategic Planning 
for Impact 
Reduction
Develop data-driven strategies and action plans aimed at minimising our environmental 
footprint. These strategies address critical aspects like energy efficiency, emission 
reduction, waste reduction and sustainable sourcing. By aligning our efforts with 
empirical data, we can achieve maximum impact in our sustainability initiatives.
Transparent 
Reporting to 
Leadership
Regularly report our progress to Senior Management and the Board. These reports 
highlight the implementation of our strategies, their effectiveness, and any adjustments 
made based on data insights. Transparency ensures accountability and encourages 
continuous improvement.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Progressively, we will regularly review, and where necessary, update roles and responsibilities to support the 
ongoing integration of climate risks and opportunities into our business strategies and financial planning. To 
further strengthen Wasco’s climate governance, we are committed to continuously enhancing the monitoring and 
reporting mechanisms aligned with the implementation of the climate-related financial disclosures framework. 
These efforts will be systematically embedded within our broader sustainability governance structure. Moving 
forward, the BUs will play a key role in monitoring and overseeing the risk assessment of climate change-related 
matters, ensuring alignment across the organisation.
Strategy 
Wasco is committed to producing in a manner that safeguards people, the environment, and the communities in 
which we operate - an approach that includes mitigating the risks associated with climate change. We recognise 
the severe short- and long-term business risks that climate change presents and are dedicated to addressing 
them by enhancing the efficiency of our operations. Our climate change strategy involves close collaboration with 
employees and supply chain partners to implement energy-saving processes and conduct comprehensive climate 
change risk assessments.
Wasco’s GHG inventory is tracked monthly through an internally developed dashboard. This tool provides insights 
into key metrics such as emission intensity, primary GHG emission sources, and other indicators that guide our  
GHG reduction strategies. Through the SSC, our management team formulates approaches to reduce our 
environmental footprint. Senior Management, together with the respective Heads of BUs, reviews GHG data 
monthly to ensure the effective implementation of reduction initiatives. The Board also receives quarterly updates 
on Wasco’s climate performance and progress.
To support our business planning, we categorise climate-related risks across distinct time horizons, which help in 
identifying and addressing risks more effectively.
Short-Term (2020-2026)
In the short-term (2020-2026), our primary focus will be on continuing efforts to reduce GHG emissions, 
ensuring high-quality climate reporting, and conducting a comprehensive climate risk assessment. These 
efforts will serve as the foundation for informed decision-making, strategy development, and setting clear 
climate-related targets. 
Wasco is also committed to gradually adopting the IFRS S1 & S2 standards by initially incorporating the 
four content pillars and 11 recommendations of the TCFD reporting framework into our climate disclosures. 
This phased approach will enable us to build robust strategic plans and more effectively assess the potential 
business implications of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
We remain sure and steadfast in our ambition to achieve Net Zero emissions for Scope 1 and 2 by 2026.  
In line with this, management will prioritise establishing clear climate strategies, roles, and responsibilities 
to support our medium- and long-term goals.
Medium-Term
(2027-2030)
Long-Term
(2031-2050)
• Develop a GHG reduction 
strategy and conduct 
climate risk assessments 
to guide climate strategy 
and target setting.
• Achieve Net Zero for

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Medium-Term (2027-2030)
In the medium-term, from 2027 to 2030, 
Wasco aims to continue advancing our 
climate strategy in alignment with national 
targets and in line with a 1.5°C pathway. 
Our focus will be on enhancing business 
resilience to climate risks while mitigating 
transition risks. A key part of this strategy 
will involve fully adopting the IFRS S1 & 
S2 standards, ensuring that climate-related 
risks, operations, and considerations are 
seamlessly integrated into our business 
strategy and financial reporting. These 
efforts will direct our ongoing investments 
in low-carbon solutions throughout our 
operations and supply chain.
We are also committed to strengthening 
leadership and management accountability 
in climate governance, with a clear focus 
on addressing climate risks, opportunities, 
strategies, and targets. In tandem with 
this, we plan to implement an internal 
carbon pricing mechanism in preparation 
for the introduction of carbon taxes by the 
government. Where feasible, we aim to 
begin implementing some of these initiatives 
ahead of schedule.
Furthermore, we will carefully consider 
capital expenditures and operational 
planning, including the development of 
new technologies that have the potential to 
reduce our customers’ GHG emissions.
Long-Term (2031-2050)
In the long-term (2031-2050), we will continue enhancing 
our existing GHG emissions reduction strategies as 
we anticipate the development of more commercially 
available green technologies and systemic solutions in 
line with Malaysia’s Net Zero commitment. Our strategy 
will include partnering with suppliers and collaborating 
on cross-industry efforts to jointly address our shared 
GHG emissions across the value chain. 
We aspire to remain a climate leader, to be a first mover 
in the industry with adoption of climate resilience 
strategies in business and being a preferred brand 
offering climate-friendly products and services to our 
customers.
Climate-related risks and opportunities will continue to 
be identified, assessed, and managed using Wasco’s 
Risk Management Framework in the same way as all 
other risks. The Board and Senior Management will 
consider, review and monitor climate-related risks 
and opportunities as part of our strategic planning, 
investment decisions, and ongoing financial and 
operational performance reviews throughout the year.
While climate change poses physical and transition 
risks, it also presents opportunities. Physical risks are 
driven by climate change and can either be acute (event-
driven) or chronic (long-term shifts in climate patterns). 
These risks could have financial implications, such 
as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from 
supply chain disruptions. On the other hand transition 
risks arise during an organisation’s transition to a low-
carbon economy. They consist of policy and legal risks, 
technology risks, market risks, and reputational risks.
The risks and opportunities, along with examples of their potential impacts, are outlined below:

Key Actions to Achieve Net Zero
• Assessing Grid Connectivity Feasibility: 
– Conducting a technical and infrastructure 
assessment to determine the feasibility of 
connecting WCME Qatar to the national grid.
– Engaging with local energy providers 
and regulatory bodies to understand grid 
availability, connection requirements, and 
potential renewable energy options.
• Transitioning to Renewable Energy: 
– We are actively shifting from fossil fuel-
based power sources to grid electricity, with 
a strong emphasis on integrating renewable 
energy into our operations. 
– This includes expanding solar energy 
adoption across key facilities, such as: 
– WCM Kuantan
– PTWEI Batam
– WPS Kota Kinabalu
– Wasco Thermal Shah Alam
– WPE Teluk Panglima Garang (with plans 
for further solar capacity expansion)
• Optimising Energy Efficiency: 
– We plan to actively implement diesel-to-
electric equipment conversions where 
feasible, replacing diesel-powered 
machinery with electrified or energy-efficient  
alternatives to minimise fuel consumption 
and emissions. This initiative has already 
been implemented during Quarter 4 2024 
at PTWEI Batam, and we are considering 
adopting a similar approach at WCME Qatar 
while transitioning to grid power.
– Additionally, we are enhancing fuel 
management and consumption tracking to 
optimise diesel usage during the transition 
phase.
– We are also integrating energy-saving 
technologies and best practices across our 
operations. 
• Enhancing Carbon Sequestration Through 
Wasco Forest Soil Carbon Stock:
– Reforestation through Wasco Forest plays 
a crucial role in Carbon Sequestration: 
Protecting and expanding forested areas 
within Wasco-managed sites to increase soil 
carbon storage capacity.
– Soil Carbon Assessment & Monitoring: 
Conducting regular soil carbon stock 
assessments to quantify and track our carbon 
sequestration progress.
Taking Collective Climate Action
Sustainability is a shared responsibility. By working together with industry partners, clients, and 
stakeholders, we can drive meaningful change and contribute to a net zero future. We encourage other 
businesses to take action and join the journey toward sustainability.
Wasco remains committed to leading by example, ensuring that our business growth aligns with 
environmental responsibility.
We will continue enhancing our climate strategy as part of our climate resilience development. Among 
the measures we plan to take include:
• Assessing climate risks based on factors such as useful life of assets and infrastructure, expected time 
of occurrence of climate impacts, internal strategies, as well as alignment with external commitments 
and regulatory frameworks.
• Conduct climate scenario analyses to evaluate potential impacts under two projected climate  
conditions and across different time horizons. These analyses help us assess the resilience of Wasco’s 
climate strategies against diverse climate scenarios and underlying assumptions.
• Conducting IFRS S1 & S2 quantitative analyses and using the relevant outcomes to formulate action 
plans. The action plans will be used to address climate matters that are aligned with Wasco’s Net Zero 
Carbon Roadmap and will be integrated into our corporate strategy and financial planning.

Risk Management
Within Wasco, climate risk evaluation is seamlessly woven into its strategic planning and business processes, 
aligning with the risk management process. For more details on the risk management process, please refer to 
our Sustainability Risk Management section from pages 58 to 59. Wasco is committed to incorporating climate 
risk considerations into our decision-making processes, strengthening adaptability, and ensuring the long-term 
sustainability of our business and the communities we serve. These considerations include:
Time Horizon and 
Effects
Climate-related risks and their associated impacts may emerge as a result of  
evolving drivers behind both physical and transition risks. These shifts can manifest 
over the short, medium, and long term, influencing business operations, market 
dynamics, and Wasco’s overall sustainability.
Geography and 
Activity Differences
The effects of climate change and associated risks will vary across regions, depending 
on geographical and operational factors. These variations can significantly influence 
business operations, market dynamics, and strategic priorities.
Complex Relationships 
and Systemic Effects
Climate change risks are intricately linked with socioeconomic structures, financial 
systems, and global supply chains. These complex interdependencies can amplify 
the overall impact, creating cascading effects that reverberate across industries and 
economies.
As part of our climate risk assessment, we undertook the 
following steps to assess the materiality of Wasco’s climate 
risks and opportunities for the shortlisted BUs which represent 
Wasco’s key business segments.
Macro Factors: Country-and Industry-Level View
In assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, we take 
into account country- and industry-specific perspectives 
relevant to the shortlisted BUs. Key factors for consideration 
include:
• The likelihood of natural disasters occurring or recurring in 
the region;
• Existing or upcoming climate-related regulations and 
policies; and
• Market dynamics and shifts in customer behaviour.
Micro Factors: Operation-Level View
We evaluated how each shortlisted BUs responds to climate 
risks and its exposure to climate-related opportunities. The 
assessment of vulnerability to climate risks was based on:
• The availability of control measures to manage and mitigate 
the impact of climate risks;
• Access to alternative resources or infrastructure to reduce 
dependency; and
• The level of preparedness, response, and recovery 
capabilities in managing natural disasters.
On the other hand, our exposure to climate opportunities was 
assessed based on:
• The potential for new revenue streams or cost savings;
• Opportunities for job creation, as well as upskilling and 
reskilling of the workforce; and
• The capital investment required to capitalise on these 
opportunities.
Moving forward, we will implement strategic 
measures to enhance the integration of climate-
related risks into Wasco’s risk management 
framework. This includes refining policy, 
procedures, risk appetite, risk tolerance, and 
overall risk management strategies. As part 
of this effort, we will adjust our risk appetite 
and tolerance levels to incorporate climate 
considerations and embed climate-related 
factors into Wasco’s existing risk assessment 
processes, such as the materiality assessment 
of climate risks and impact pathways. 
We may enhance our current risk taxonomy 
and risk profile by incorporating relevant 
physical and transition climate risks. When 
necessary, we will evaluate emerging climate 
risks and opportunities based on business 
segments and geography. Additionally, we 
are dedicated to standardising our global 
climate risk assessment process to maintain 
consistency and transparency.
We will actively communicate the process to 
all BUs, equipping them with a standardised 
approach to assess climate risks and 
opportunities. This will allow us to proactively 
manage climate risks and capitalise on 
potential opportunities. Future enhancements 
will include developing monitoring 
mechanisms to integrate climate risk into 
overall risk management practices, ensuring 
regular review by the Board.

Metrics and Targets
Metrics and targets are how an organisation measures and monitors its climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Organisations disclose metrics and targets to enable stakeholders to better assess an organisation’s potential risk-
adjusted returns, ability to meet financial obligations, general exposure to climate-related issues, and progress in 
managing or adapting to those issues.
These metrics, along with regular reporting, enable Wasco to effectively assess and manage climate-related risks 
and opportunities, ensuring alignment with its sustainability goals and long-term strategic objectives.
Wasco is committed to progressively minimising our operational emissions to align with the global goal of limiting 
temperature rise to 1.5°C. To support this commitment, we have established climate-related metrics to effectively 
measure and monitor key parameters, guiding our collective action plan in addressing climate-related challenges.
Scope 1, 2, and 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Wasco is dedicated to maintaining transparency and accountability in its climate performance. As part of this 
commitment, Wasco regularly discloses its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to ensure clear and comprehensive 
reporting on its environmental impact.
All emissions have been calculated using the methodologies outlined in the Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Protocol. The 
emission factors are derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (“IPCC”) Sixth Assessment 
Report (“AR6”) and with consultation with Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Centre (“MGTC”) 
for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. For Scope 3 emissions, calculations are based on data from the United Kingdom’s 
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) 2023. This updated methodology allows for a more 
detailed and comprehensive breakdown of GHG emissions.

Forests Alone Cannot Handle Carbon: Balancing Nature’s Role in Climate Change
During the past year, we continued maintenance activities 
for the 160,000 trees planted in Wasco Forest Phase One. 
Third-party consultants were engaged to track and monitor 
the growth of Wasco Forest. We also engaged the Forest 
Research Institute Malaysia to conduct a soil organic carbon 
assessment to determine the soil carbon pool at the site. We 
are pleased to share that our forest is healthy and growing 
well. This sentiment is shared by the Pahang Forestry 
Department, which has granted an additional 670 hectares 
of land in Maran for us to continue our reforestation efforts. 
In Phase Two of Wasco’s tree-planting programme, we will 
continue cultivating a diverse range of carbon-sequestering 
plants across 670 hectares, with the goal of eventually planting 
approximately 1 million trees.
FACTS: Nature has garnered 
significant attention for its 
remarkable ability to remove 
carbon dioxide (“CO 2”) from 
the atmosphere and sequester 
it within the biosphere. This 
natural process occurs through 
photosynthesis, involving soils, 
grasslands, trees, and mangroves. 
However, nature is not only a 
carbon sink; it also contributes to 
carbon dioxide emissions due to 
deforestation, land degradation, 
ecosystem disruption, and 
agricultural practices. Fortunately, 
strategic changes in land 
management practices can 
mitigate emissions and enhance 
carbon storage.
SOLUTIONS: The urgency of 
achieving net-zero emissions 
to safeguard our planet is 
undeniable. A pivotal strategy 
relies on tree-planting—the most 
impactful and cost-effective 
method to extract CO 2 from the 
atmosphere. Net-zero initiatives 
hinge on maximising the carbon 
uptake capacity of these trees 
beyond their existing absorption 
rates.
Wasco’s volunteers joined forces with local communities at the Pulau Buluh Clean-Up in Batam, Indonesia.

Pollution Prevention and Control
Wasco is committed to addressing pollution by 
taking the following measures to reduce and 
avoid pollution impacts. They include:
• Identifying resources and the generation of all 
types of waste;
• Avoiding their impact and improving efficiency;
• Reducing or eliminating pollution at its source; 
and
• Modifying production, maintenance, and 
facility processes through material substitution, 
conservation, recycling, and reuse wherever 
applicable.
Preserving Biodiversity
We strive to operate responsibly and protect 
biodiversity where we work worldwide. As part 
of our commitment to the SDGs, we commit to 
net positive biodiversity impact by exploring our 
impacts on biodiversity, protected areas and areas 
of significant biological value at our operational 
sites. We are focused on minimising biodiversity 
impact and our environmental footprint, 
preserving natural habitats and protecting and 
restoring ecosystems through nature-based 
projects.
We conduct formal biodiversity risk assessments on  
existing operations and potential new operations and 
projects. Before commencing a project, we perform a detailed 
Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) to study the 
potential impact of our operations on habitats and ecological 
functions. The EIA also helps us to formulate risk mitigation 
approaches. For example, biodiversity risks are continuously 
monitored at our new site in Tanzania.
Waste
Wasco is responsible for conducting business without any 
detrimental effects on the environment. We comply with all 
applicable and prevailing laws and industry standards on 
waste management, adopting products, systems, and work 
practices that minimise or reduce the impact of waste whilst 
improving efficiency by increasing the potential for reuse and 
recycling of resources.
The Wasco Waste Management Procedure sets out the 
following expectations:
• Promote efficient use of resources to reduce pollution 
impacts.
• Minimise waste generation at the source wherever feasible.
• Explore alternative disposal methods by adopting cleaner 
and more sustainable technologies.
• Ensure full compliance with all legal requirements related 
to waste handling and disposal.
Our waste handling process for every type of waste disposed of from our operations is presented below.
Sewage and 
Greywater
• Sewage and greywater are collected in designated tanks that are properly plumbed 
and connected to ablution and lunchroom facilities.
• Tanks are emptied regularly by an authorised contractor.
Scrap Metal • Scrap metal, including copper, is collected in a scrap metal skip.
• Scrap metal is collected or replaced by a contractor as appropriate.
General Waste • Scrap timber and large general waste items are collected in a general waste skip.
• Smaller or lighter general waste items, waste paper and food waste are collected in 
local, lined bins. Waste is fully contained and tied within suitable garbage bags upon 
emptying before being placed in the general waste skip to prevent it from being blown 
by the wind.
• The general waste skip is emptied by a contractor as required.
Recyclable 
Containers
• Aluminium cans and plastic bottles are deposited in a designated recycling bin for 
donation.
Waste Paint • Waste paint is allowed to fully harden in its original container and is then disposed of 
according to the Safety Data Sheet requirements, either as general waste or through 
an authorised contractor.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
Oily Rags • Oily rags are stored in a designated oily rag receptacle.
• Clients’ maintenance operations must implement a process for the proper disposal of 
oily rags.
Hydrotest Water • Hydrotest water is collected for proper disposal.
• The greywater system can handle untreated test water volumes of up to 100 litres. 
Operations ensure that the greywater system can manage the volume at the time of 
disposal. If the site cannot accommodate the additional volume, third parties may be 
engaged for disposal.
Waste Condensate • An authorised contractor collects condensate waste using suitable containers for safe 
transport and disposal.
• The client is responsible for providing a designated, bundled storage area for waste 
containers pending collection.
Waste Amine • An authorised contractor collects amine waste using suitable containers for safe 
transport and disposal.
• The client is responsible for providing a designated, bunded storage area for waste 
containers pending collection.
Soil/Spoil • A civil contractor removes soil and spoils from the site, transporting them for disposal 
at an authorised facility.
Waste Concrete • A civil contractor removes waste concrete from the site, transporting them for disposal 
at an authorised facility.
Contaminate Soil • Contaminated soil, when identified, is removed and stockpiled for disposal at a 
suitably licensed facility.
Noise Boundary Monitoring
Noise generated during the construction, operation, and decommissioning phases of large infrastructure projects 
can potentially affect nearby noise-sensitive receptors. In adherence to the Environmental Quality Act 1974, the 
Group conducts boundary noise monitoring at multiple points along the perimeter of its operations, in line with 
the approval conditions outlined in EIAs. In 2024, the average noise level remained within the permissible limit of 
65 decibels (dBA), as stipulated by the Department of Environment.
Conserving Water Resources
We actively manage our freshwater usage and the potential impacts of our operations on surrounding water 
resources. To reduce consumption and improve efficiency, we prioritise the use of alternatives such as recycled 
water. A range of internal processes help us assess and manage water-related risks, focusing on conservation, 
reuse, and recycling. Each site follows our HSE Management Plan, which includes a Water Management Procedure. 
This procedure sets out appropriate control and monitoring measures in line with local regulations and applicable 
legal requirements.
Some examples of site level water reduction measures include water recycling, rainwater harvesting and reusing 
process water used in plant operation where possible. There were no violations of water quality standards during 
this reporting period.

Circular Economy
Wasco is capitalising on its commitment to sustainability with a new initiative 
that recycles discarded polyethylene (“PE”) and polypropylene (“PP”) from 
its three layer anti-corrosion coating process. As part of its drive toward net 
zero carbon emissions by 2026, this effort reflects Wasco’s focus on reducing 
waste and boosting resource efficiency across its operations.
The initiative reprocesses used PE and PP into resin, which is then employed 
for purging die heads during material changeovers—a crucial maintenance 
step that keeps machinery clean and ready for production. By using recycled 
resin, Wasco conserves virgin material for coating applications, yielding both 
environmental and financial benefits.
The programme has already delivered significant savings, with recycled PE/
PP now constituting 7% of the total material purchased. The switch from 
virgin to recycled materials has resulted in an 81% reduction in purging 
costs, reflecting the initiative’s impact on both sustainability and operational 
efficiency.
Aligned with Wasco’s broader sustainability strategy, this initiative supports 
Wasco vision to deliver reliable, competitive energy solutions while  
advancing its net zero goals. By closing the loop on these materials,  
Wasco not only cuts its environmental footprint but also strengthens its 
competitive edge in a sustainability-driven market.

Healthcare
Project Nutrisi Sihat Wasco – Vaccination programme
Wasco, through its subsidiary in Kuantan, Shah Alam, Telok Panglima Garang, and Kota Kinabalu, launched the 
“Projek Nutrisi Sihat Wasco” programme to promote public health. In collaboration with Poliklinik Shaik and 
Medisinar, they provided flu and HPV vaccinations to 266 individuals.
This initiative aligned with Wasco’s sustainability goals and 
helped prevent flu-related complications. The flu vaccine reduced 
the risk of severe illness, while the HPV vaccine protected against 
infections that could cause cancers, including cervical, genital, 
throat, and anus cancers, as well as genital warts.
Wasco’s volunteers dedicated over 180 hours to the event, 
underscoring our commitment to Social Impact Projects. The event 
concluded with a tea, offering volunteers and children a chance to 
connect. 
Health Checkup at Bukit Gong, Chini
In collaboration with the dedicated medical team of Ivorymedic 
Clinic, Kuantan, Wasco embarked on a mission to bring healthcare 
directly to the vibrant Orang Asli community in Bukit Gong, Chini, 
Pahang, who often faced challenges in accessing medical services 
due to their rural location. We provided comprehensive health  
check-ups, including blood pressure, diabetes, and BMI assessments. 
The response was truly inspiring, with participants ranging from 
young children to seniors over 60 years old.
In addition to the check-ups, our team also conducted health 
awareness sessions, emphasising the importance of regular health 
check-ups and healthy living practices with the aim of educating the 
community on managing their health proactively. Understanding 
the essential needs of the community, we also distributed groceries 
and medicines to ensure they had adequate resources to maintain 
their health and well-being.

organised several blood donation 
campaigns in Batam, Kota Kinabalu, 
Kuantan, Qatar, Singapore, Shah

embodying the spirit of giving and 
compassion.
Each drop of blood donated was a 
testament to our collective effort, 
not only saving lives but also 
fostering a deep sense of communal 
solidarity. The resounding success of 
the campaign, with 930 volunteers 
and 466 pints of blood collected, 
exemplified the profound impact of 
collective action in fostering well-
being and resilience within our 
communities.

Maendeleo Programme
Through our operations in Tanzania, Wasco collaborated with the East African Crude Oil Pipeline Project team, 
construction contractor Basenet, and local carpenters Andrew and Zabron to complete three impactful community 
projects in Ilalo, Selemi, and Wella II villages.
These projects were part of the Maendeleo Programme, which aims to improve the socio-economic development 
of Igusule ward. The projects included revitalising the Ilalo village office, building two new classrooms in Selemi, 
and providing school supplies such as 108 desks, office cabinets, and chairs. All three projects were officially 
handed over to the village councils, accompanied by vibrant celebrations featuring traditional dances, songs,  
and feasts.

Project Nutrisi Sihat Wasco – Food Distribution
Wasco spread joy and compassion throughout the community with our “Project Nutrisi Sihat 2024” programme. 
More than just an initiative, this project embodied our commitment to creating a positive impact through kindness 
and generosity, extending warmth and goodwill to the communities within our network of operations.
Our team worked together to prepare, package and distribute food to the communities in Kuantan, Kota Kinabalu, 
Shah Alam, and Teluk Panglima Garang. These efforts, benefiting nearly 2,085 individuals, not only brought our 
team together but also provided an opportunity for us to connect with and support those in need.
At Wasco, philanthropy is at the core of our mission. Through these initiatives, we strive to exemplify our  
dedication to social responsibility and to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those around us.
School Infrastructure Upgrades
Wasco has become a catalyst for positive change in 
Batam’s local communities. A flagship programme was 
recently kickstarted, focused on the upgrading of school 
infrastructure, to create safe and enriching learning 
environments for the children in the area.
This comprehensive initiative includes key improvements 
such as constructing an art studio stage, concreting 
schoolyards, building new restrooms, renovating existing 
facilities, repairing classroom ceilings, and providing 
essential furniture for schools.
Four schools — SDN007, SDN006, SMPN38, and SDN011 — situated within a 5KM radius of Wasco’s base in Batam, 
with a combined student population of 4,000, will benefit from this transformative initiative.

Recycling PET Plastic Bottles, Batam
Wasco joined forces with local communities during the Pulau 
Buluh Clean-Up in Batam, Indonesia. Organised by Free the Sea, 
a non-profit focused on transforming ocean-bound plastic waste 
into valuable resources, the event was part of a broader effort to 
promote sustainability in the Riau Islands. 
Eleven Wasco volunteers joined 260 participants from schools, 
businesses, and community groups, collecting 1,472.7 kg of 
waste—including 683.6 kg of clothing, 657.1 kg of general plastic, 
and 132 kg of PET plastic. Beyond improving living conditions for 
nearly 3,000 residents, this initiative demonstrated the power of 
collective action in driving meaningful and lasting environmental 
change. 
Clean UAE
Wasco proudly partnered with the Emirates Environmental Group in 
their impactful annual campaign, “Clean UAE,” held on 7 December 
2024. 
This nationwide initiative served as a powerful platform for WEIL 
employees to actively support environmental stewardship by helping 
preserve natural habitats, advocating for recycling, and promoting the 
use of recyclable materials across local industries.

Circular Economy
For 2024, the central theme of our social impact project 
is the Circular Economy. In addition to various projects 
supporting our three core impact pillars of environment, 
healthcare, and humanity, all sites conducted projects 
supporting circularity. These projects focused on 
repurposing everyday waste materials such as plastic 
bottles, paper, and cardboard. For example, plastic 
materials collected were transformed into threads 
and textiles, which were then used to create products 
like clothing and blankets. By giving new life to these 
materials, the project not only reduced waste but 
also helped lower environmental impact and carbon 
footprint, contributing to a more sustainable and 
resource-efficient future.
Additionally, Wasco made incredible progress in 
e-waste recycling. We collected 205 kg of e-waste, 
including laptops, monitors, printers, phones, office 
phones, home appliances, small consumer electronic 
devices, and small electronic peripherals and 
components. Beyond the numbers, this drive embodied 
Wasco’s collective commitment to sustainability and 
responsible recycling.

Learning and Development: Empowering Growth and 
Innovation
In the past year, Wasco has reaffirmed its commitment 
to fostering a culture of continuous learning and 
professional growth. Recognising that our employees 
are the cornerstone of our success, we have prioritised 
learning and development (“L&D”) initiatives to 
drive engagement, adaptability, and long-term 
competitiveness in an ever-evolving landscape.
Our L&D strategy is closely aligned with Wasco’s 
innovation, operational excellence, and customer-
centricity objectives. By equipping our teams with 
future-ready skills and leadership capabilities, we 
are directly supporting Wasco’s strategic priorities. 
Hence, we offer a vast range of learning programmes 
and interventions to fulfil the diverse learning needs 
identified by our employees and their supervisors.
We firmly believe that investing in our people is 
investing in our future. By nurturing a resilient, skilled, 
and motivated workforce, we are poised to navigate 
challenges and seize opportunities in the years ahead. 
Our L&D initiatives will continue to evolve, ensuring 
alignment with both employee aspirations and the 
dynamic needs of our industry.
Fostering Young Talent
At Wasco, we understand that investing in young 
talent is essential to shaping a sustainable and 
innovative future. Our dedication to fostering the next 
generation of professionals is demonstrated through 
our comprehensive talent development programmes, 
valuable internship opportunities, and mentorship 
initiatives. These offerings are designed to equip young 
individuals with the skills, knowledge, and hands-on 
experiences they need to succeed and excel in the 
industry.

Employee engagement plays a vital role in boosting our 
employees’ motivation and morale. Wasco prioritises 
open communication through regular dialogues 
physically and virtually to update employees on group 
developments. Close-knit engagement activities at the 
departmental level help strengthen team cohesion and 
address human resource matters in a more focused and 
supportive environment.
Wasco also leverages a variety of engagement 
platforms, including workplace meetings, employee 
briefings, intranet updates, bulletins, and LinkedIn, to 
promote open and transparent communication across 
the organisation. Key topics such as equal opportunities, 
diversity, career progression and rewards are regularly 
addressed through these channel.

Occupational Health and Safety
In a world where health, safety and environmental 
(HSE) stewardship has become more critical than ever, 
Wasco stands as a beacon of excellence, setting new 
standards in HSE performance. Our journey towards 
achieving Target Zero (Nobody gets hurt, No damage 
to property, and No harm to the environment) is not just 
about compliance, but a testament to our commitment 
to fostering a culture of safety, sustainability, and 
continuous improvement.
With more than 30 years of experience in coating pipes, 
Wasco’s commitment to safety excellence is ingrained 
in its culture, setting it apart as an industry leader with 
an engaged and proactive workforce having a renewed 
sense of vulnerability to risk. In 2024, Wasco achieved 
notable HSE success, including the accomplishment 
of 39 million LTI-free man-hours, underpinned by 
strong management commitment and support, as 
well as the organisation’s robust capabilities in safety  
management. These key elements provided the 
foundation for driving a culture of safety excellence.
Wasco’s HSE Policy applies to all contractors, 
employees, and stakeholders operating within its 
premises. We are dedicated to fostering a culture 
of continuous improvement, risk mitigation, and 
regulatory compliance. Wasco remains fully committed 
to adhering to the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
(OHSA) 2024, the Environmental Quality Act (EQA) 
1974, and all other relevant laws, regulations, orders, 
industry standards, and best practices to which it 
subscribes wherever we operate. 
We are pleased to report zero fatalities in 2024—a 
testament to the strength of our health and safety 
practices. However, we did record one LTI, resulting 
in a Lost Time Incident Frequency of 0.05, significantly 
below the industry average of 0.24. Our Total Recordable 
Incident Frequency stood at 1.15, compared to the 
industry benchmark of 0.94, as published in the IOGP 
Safety Performance 2023 report by the International 
Association of Oil & Gas Producers.
All incidents—including near misses—are reported 
promptly. Comprehensive investigations are conducted 
to determine root causes, and corrective as well 
as preventive actions are implemented to prevent 
recurrence. Lessons learnt from each incident are 
shared across the organisation to foster continuous 
improvement.
The success achieved in 2024 has had a significant 
impact on Wasco’s HSE management practices and 
performance. Employees have embraced safety as a 
core value instead of just being regarded as a priority. 
We remain committed to continuous improvement, 
proactive risk management and fostering a strong 
safety culture to protect the health and well-being 
of our workforce earning the respect of clients. This 
shift in mind-set towards safety has elevated Wasco’s 
reputation as a trusted industry leader committed to 
maintaining a safe and secure working environment.
Our journey toward safety excellence is anchored in a culture that prioritises care, accountability, and 
continuous improvement. Key focus areas in 2024 included:

2024 Highlights
To ensure continuous improvement and proactive HSE 
risk management, Wasco utilises two key initiatives:
• Wasco CARE Plus Programme
 This programme tracks 15 leading indicators, which 
are monitored monthly to identify early warning 
signs of potential issues. The data collected allows 
Wasco to detect trends in performance, empowering 
management to allocate the necessary resources and 
implement timely interventions to address concerns.
• Wasco CARE Card System
 Embracing digital technology, Wasco introduced 
the Wasco CARE Card system, an online platform 
designed for reporting Unsafe Conditions or Unsafe 
Acts (UCUAs). This system streamlines the process 
of reporting safety concerns and provides an efficient 
mechanism for follow-up and corrective actions. The 
transition from manual to digital reporting has made 
it easier for workers, subcontractors, visitors, and 
clients to share safety feedback, further strengthening 
Wasco’s commitment to safety across its operations.
Looking ahead to FY2025, we will reinforce our safety 
initiatives, strengthen preventive measures, and 
enhance employee engagement to achieve our ultimate 
goal: ZERO injuries across all operations.
Emergency Response Team
Wasco’s Emergency Response Team is responsible 
for directing evacuation procedures with the aid of fire 
wardens, subcontractors, suppliers and emergency 
services.
Assessing Safety Risks and Compliance
Health hazard, accident and injury prevention are 
integral parts of the sustainable strategy and business 
risk management processes. Wasco’s due diligence 
includes a health and safety risk assessment for 
existing and potential new operations or projects. 
Wasco benchmarks performance monitoring results 
and trends against its targets and industry standards.

Our Current Safety Culture
Wasco embarked on a transformative journey to 
cultivate a robust safety culture, recognising its pivotal 
role in achieving Target Zero. Leveraging the expertise  
of DuPont Sustainable Solutions, a comprehensive 
safety culture transformation programme was initiated  
across Wasco in May 2021. Through this ongoing 
programme, two safety perception surveys were 
conducted to gauge our safety culture, providing 
invaluable insights into areas of strength and 
opportunities for improvement.
Promotion of Operational Discipline
Operational discipline is promoted through a 
multifaceted approach that includes daily pre-start 
briefings for all employees, providing a comprehensive 
understanding of job-specific HSE requirements. 
Mentoring, on-the-job training, and re-coaching are 
utilised to ensure that employees meet expectations 
and address behaviours that are below standards.  
This proactive approach fosters a culture of 
accountability and continuous improvement, driving 
Wasco towards its goal of safety excellence.
HSE Certification
Our ISO 45001:2018 certification covers 67% of Wasco’s 
operations, ensuring compliance with Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System standards.
Safety Governance
Wasco’s Group HSE Committee plays a vital role 
in enhancing workplace safety, improving working 
conditions, and providing a platform for employees and 
management to address health and safety challenges 
collaboratively.
This participatory initiative is led by MD/GCEO Gian 
Carlo Maccagno, and consists of a chairman and 
key management representatives. The committee is 
responsible for reviewing safety concerns, assessing 
performance and risks, and ensuring continuous 
improvement in HSE practices. Additionally, it provides 
regular reports on Wasco’s safety performance to the 
Board, reinforcing Wasco’s commitment to a safe and 
healthy work environment for all.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
In 2024, we enhanced our human rights practices by formalising Wasco’s Human Rights Policy. This policy was 
reviewed by the Sustainability Steering Committee and approved by the Board, before its distribution to employees.
Wasco aligns its business conduct with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
To ensure effective implementation, the day-to-day responsibilities for monitoring and ensuring human rights 
compliance are embedded within relevant departments across the organisation. This integrated approach enables 
proactive oversight and reinforces our commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.
We respect human rights by:
• Proactively assessing our human rights impacts on an ongoing basis as part of Wasco’s core business  
processes;
• Evaluating the effects of the business and setting targets to drive continuous improvement;
• Avoiding, preventing and mitigating human rights issues;
• Communicating expectations to all stakeholders, including business partners; and
• Implementing human rights screening, training, and monitoring of internal operations and supply chain  
partners.
Wasco adheres to all applicable employment and human rights regulations in the countries where we operate. 
Suppliers are expected to do the same and abide by Wasco’s Principles of Business Conduct and Human Rights 
Policy at a minimum. To ensure supplier compliance, our procurement process includes a requirement for vendors 
to sign our Corporate Social Responsibility (Labour) Declaration.
Wasco ensures compliance to all relevant labour laws and our internal Principles of Business Conduct cover  
human rights issues, including non-discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining, and the 
prevention of child labour, forced and compulsory labour.
Our Approach to the Human Rights Issues Affecting the Industry
Forced Labour We do not tolerate forced labour or any forms of modern slavery, including bonded 
labour and human trafficking. All employees willingly accept the offers extended  
by Wasco.
Child Labour We strictly adhere to international child labour laws and observe the minimum legal 
working age in every country where we operate.
Discrimination We prohibit all forms of discrimination based on race, creed, sex, social status, 
religion, nationality, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, physical or mental 
disability, or any other grounds.
Harassment and 
Inhumane Treatment
Harassment in any form - whether physical, mental, sexual, or power harassment - is 
strictly not tolerated.
Working Hours  
and Wages
We monitor employee working hours, holidays, and leaves of absence to comply 
with applicable laws and regulations.
Grievance Transparency and respectful engagement are cornerstones of our sustainability 
performance, allowing our business to evolve successfully and respectfully. 
We consider a robust grievance mechanism essential to protecting the people, 
communities, and environments affected by our operations.

Non-Discrimination
Wasco is committed to a workforce free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.

were no reported cases of discrimination related to equality and diversity in 2024.
Equality in Recruitment
Wasco adheres to local labour laws during recruitment, with a strong preference for hiring locally. Hiring from 
local communities enhances our ability to understand local needs and strengthens our operational capabilities on 
the ground. However, diverse talent and expertise are vital as we serve an ever-expanding international customer 
base. Wasco sources these talents and expertise internationally when unavailable locally.
We are committed to equal opportunity and non-discrimination throughout the hiring process, assessing  
candidates solely based on their qualifications and suitability for the role. Wasco ensures that our hiring practices 
are inclusive, welcoming candidates from underprivileged groups, deprived backgrounds, and people with 
disabilities. While we strive to create an inclusive workplace, at the end of FY2024, we had no employees with 
disabilities. We are actively exploring partnerships with organisations and initiatives to enhance accessibility 
and provide more opportunities for individuals with disabilities in the future. Our goal is to ensure that Wasco  
remains an organisation where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. 
In 2024, Wasco recorded an overall voluntary turnover rate of 9.3%. Females represented 11% of our total  
workforce, and female representation at the Senior Leadership Team level remained steady at 14%.
Speak up
Wasco complies with all relevant laws by continuously monitoring internal processes, such as hiring and promotion. 
We actively encourage employees to speak up if they believe that any actions have violated the Principles of 
Business Conduct or labour laws. We take all reports seriously, investigate each rigorously, we hold both our 
internal teams and external partners such as suppliers accountable to the highest ethical standards.

Salient Human Rights Issues
Wasco assessed potential adverse human rights impacts and identified salient human rights issues. Engaging  
with stakeholders helped to pinpoint potential human rights impacts affecting operations.
Rights to: Freedom of association and engagement Just and favourable conditions of work
An adequate standard of living Health
Social security and social insurance
Wasco supports the amendments to the Workers’ Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990.  
All contractors working on our projects must provide worker facilities that adhere to the International Labour 
Organisation’s guidelines.
Employees’ wages are in full compliance with all applicable Malaysian laws, such as working hours, minimum 
living wages, overtime compensation, and legally mandated benefits. In compliance with Malaysian law, we pay 
workers for overtime at rates above the stated regular hourly rates. Docking wages as a disciplinary measure is not 
permitted. We also aim to mitigate excessive working hours by limiting them wherever possible.
Product Responsibility
As a provider of cutting-edge technical services and licensed technologies, Wasco possesses the capabilities to 
deliver reliable and competitive products, premium solutions, and unrivalled services.
Premium Solutions, Flawless Deliveries
Wasco’s quality management system (“QMS”) employs a process approach, enabling us to plan processes 
and interactions efficiently. We are committed to enhancing customer satisfaction by delivering products and  
services that meet all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
Our QMS aligns with the latest ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 standards. Additionally, our laboratories are 
certified under ISO/IEC 17025, which sets the general requirements for the competence of testing and calibration 
laboratories published by the ISO.
We ensure all company and project-level QMS processes operate effectively to improve customer satisfaction,  
as outlined in Wasco’s Quality Policy.
The installation of an Improved Pipe Tracking System has enhanced our quality delivery by allowing us to track 
individual pipeline movement and status throughout the coating process. The system ensures accurate tracking of 
the pipes’ current position, including repairs and rejections, which improves traceability. The use of the powerful 
Welds Tracking System further boosts efficiency by effectively managing our welders’ status, reducing wasted 
resources and improving overall performance.
Wasco also encourages anonymous customer feedback and monitors the results regularly. Maintaining close 
customer engagement at various project stages helps us understand their needs and exceed their expectations.

5.4 Conflict of Interest Policy
 The Conflict of Interest Policy was established and approved by the Board of Directors on 27 February 
2024 in line with Bursa Malaysia’s focus on enhancing the MMLR to address issues associated with 
conflict of interest involving Directors and Key Senior Management of the WB Group. The Conflict of 
Interest Policy was last reviewed by the Board on 29 August 2024.
 The objective of the policy is to ensure that actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest are 
identified and managed effectively as it provides guidance on how to deal with conflict of interest 
situations as they arise and to protect the Group’s interest, while assisting the Directors and employees 
to perform with high integrity and ethical standards. 
 The policy applies to all Directors and employees of the WB Group (including employees on contract 
terms, temporary staff and those on internship). The policy applies when an individual recognises, or 
should reasonably recognise, that a conflict of interest may arise from their current or future activities. 
The policy guides the individual on how to identify and declare all conflict of interest, guides the Group 
on how to develop, implement and monitor actions to appropriately manage the conflict, and how to 
deal with breaches of the policy. The scope of the policy is relatively wide in coverage of the activities 
that may give rise to conflicts of interest. 
 The Conflict of Interest Policy is available on the Company’s website at www.wascoenergy.com.

by the Company and its subsidiaries within its fold.
 The External Auditors are invited to attend the AC Meetings where the Group’s annual financial results 
are considered, to review and discuss the Group’s audit findings, internal controls and accounting 
policies and as and when the need arises.
 For the financial year under review, the AC had two (2) meetings with the External Auditors without the

opinions/dialogue between both parties.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
 The AC obtains written confirmation from the External Auditors on their independence throughout 
their terms of engagement for the financial year in compliance with the requirements of the relevant 
professional and regulatory bodies and/or authorities.
 The Board also reviews the External Auditors’ annual audit plan and scope of work for each of the financial 
years and the External Auditors’ audit review on the financial statements for each of the financial years 
together with their audit report.
 The Annual Assessment Form for External Auditors is established to assess the annual performance 
of the External Auditors by the AC. During the financial year under review, the AC had reviewed the 
independence of the External Auditors by taking into consideration among other factors, the following:-
• rotation of the External Audit Partner-in-charge once in every five years in accordance with the 
relevant laws and requirements; and
• the professionalism, openness in communication and interaction with the External Auditors 
through private discussions which had demonstrated their independence.
 The AC also assessed the suitability, objectivity and independence of the External Auditors by taking into 
consideration among other factors, the following:-
• size, sufficiency of the allocated resources and geographical coverage of the external audits being 
conducted;
• calibre, competency, requisite skills and expertise, including industry knowledge of the audit team 
to effectively audit the Company and the Group that meet the requirements;
• adequacy of audit scope and plan to address the accounting risks, audit risk and financial reporting 
risks faced by the Company and the Group;
• quality and effectiveness of the audit services provided by the External Auditors;
• the External Auditors met their performance targets as expected of them; and
• the information presented in the External Auditors’ Annual Transparency Report.
 Based on the results of the Annual Assessment of External Auditors carried out during the financial year 
under review, the AC was satisfied with the independence and suitability of the External Auditors and 
hence had recommended the re-appointment of the External Auditors for the Board’s consideration.
 The Board, upon the recommendation of the AC, concurred on the suitability and independence of the 
External Auditors and had therefore agreed to table the resolution for the re-appointment of the External 
Auditors to the Shareholders at the forthcoming Twenty-Fifth AGM for their approval.
 Further information on the role of the AC with the External Auditors is stated in the AC Report on pages 
126 to 131 of this Annual Report.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT  
AND INTERNAL CONTROL
BOARD’S RESPONSIBILITIES
The Board of Directors (“Board”) recognizes the importance of sound risk management and internal control 
practices for good corporate governance. 
The Board plays a crucial role in providing direction and oversight of risk management across the organization. The 
Group is guided by ISO 31000:2018 to support the organization at different stages of risk maturity. This involves a 
regular review of the adequacy of processes for identifying, evaluating, and managing significant risks through a 
risk management process, which includes a reporting structure. 
The Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate risks appropriately, rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure in achieving business objectives. Given the inherent limitations of all control systems, they can 
only provide reasonable assurance, not absolute certainty.
The Board, through the Board Sustainability Committee (“BSC”), has received reports from the Risk Management 
Committee (“RMC”) confirming that the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are operating 
adequately and effectively in all material aspects, based on the existing frameworks in place for the financial year 
2024 (“FY 2024”).
Based on the reports received from the RMC through the BSC and the reports from various sources (including both 
internal and external auditors), the Board is of the view that the risk management and internal control system in 
place for FY 2024 and up to the date of approval of this statement is adequate and effective in safeguarding the 
Group’s assets, interests of shareholders, customers, regulators and employees.
In evaluating the adequacy of risk management, the Board is supported by the BSC and RMC to ensure that the risk 
management framework functions effectively.
RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
The RMC, a sub-committee of the BSC, was established by the Board to ensure that a robust risk management 
framework is embedded in the Group’s culture, processes, and structures. The RMC oversees the effectiveness of 
the Group’s policies and processes for identifying, evaluating, and managing risks.
To support this, the RMC meets quarterly to review identified risks and ensure they are managed within acceptable 
levels.
The RMC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and comprises members of the Senior Management Team from 
the Group’s major business segments. 
The RMC key management responsibilities includes amongst others; 
• Reviewing the Group Risk Management Framework, as needed, for approval by the BSC and Board;
• Ensuring that the processes for identifying, assessing, treating, monitoring and reporting of all material 
business risks are operating as intended;
• Maintaining and reviewing the Group’s top risks and segmental/business unit risk profiles with support from 
the Group Risk Management;
• Providing guidance and direction to the Business Units on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal 
control system in identifying and mitigating material business risks; and
• Undertaking any other risk management tasks delegated to the committee by the BSC/Board.
KEY ELEMENTS AND PROCESSES ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS
The key elements and processes established for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management 
and internal control system include the following:-

RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group Risk Management Framework, which is embedded in the management system of the Group, clearly 
defines the authority and accountability in implementing the risk management process and internal control system. 
The Management via RMC assists the Board in implementing the process of identifying, evaluating, and managing 
significant risks applicable to their respective areas of business and in formulating suitable internal controls to 
mitigate and control these risks.
The Management also provides reasonable assurance that the Group’s risks and internal control systems are 
effective. 
All business segments and major departments within the Group conducted risk assessments to identify risks 
relevant to their areas of responsibility. They analyzed the likelihood of these risks occurring, assessed their 
potential impact, evaluated the risk levels, and identified existing controls and actions needed to manage these 
risks to an acceptable level. The resulting risk profiles are documented in risk registers, with each business or 
operational area maintaining its own register. This process is facilitated by the Group Risk Management.
The risk assessment report is submitted to the RMC on a quarterly basis. During the quarterly RMC meetings, the 
significant risk identified by the business units are presented for deliberation. The RMC reports to the BSC on the 
significant risk affecting the Group as well as any substantial changes in the business and external environment 
that may impact the key risks identified. 
Through the BSC, the Board has approved the Risk Management Framework, which outlines the governance structure 
and assigns responsibilities across various levels of management and operations. The ultimate responsibility for 
implementing the framework rests with top management and members of the Wasco Berhad Group Management. 
This implementation is evidenced by the integration of effective risk management practices into relevant business 
processes, supporting decision making to achieve the Group’s objectives. 
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The RMC primarily develops, executes, and manages the risk management system to ensure that the Group’s 
corporate objectives and strategies are achieved within its acceptable risk appetite. It reviews, addresses, and 
responses to significant identified risks, including non-compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules, and 
guidelines, as well as changes to internal controls and management information systems. Additionally, the reviews 
encompass outputs from monitoring processes and ongoing evaluations of identified risks and the effectiveness of 
mitigation strategies and controls.

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION
The internal audit engagements are performed by the Group Internal Audit (“GIA”), where their primary 
responsibility is to provide independent and objective assurance in assisting the Group to accomplish its objectives 
by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, 
control and governance. The Head of GIA reports functionally to the AC and administratively to the Managing 
Director/Group Chief Executive Officer.
The audit engagements were carried out based on the approved annual Internal Audit Plan. In FY 2024, the GIA had 
completed 5 risk-based audit reviews which were presented to the AC. The audit scope included project management 
and performance review, Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”), business strategies, human rights, and 
foreign subcontract workers management at entities level. High impact audit findings pertaining to risk, control, 
compliance and governance with recommendation for further improvements were escalated to the attention 
and scrutiny of the senior management and subsequently tabled to the AC quarterly. Follow-up reviews of audit 
engagements were also conducted every quarter to ensure proper and effective remedial actions have been taken 
by the management to close control gaps highlighted by the GIA. All the internal audit activities and processes 
performed in FY 2024 were guided by the Internal Audit Charter and the GIA Standard Operating Procedure. The 
GIA is in conformance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.
OTHER KEY ELEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
Internal control processes, which are embedded for effective Group’s operations include:-
• A clearly defined organisational structure and financial authorisation limits;
• Group policies, including Principles of Business Conduct and Whistleblowing Policy and Standard Operating 
Procedures to ensure compliance with internal controls, relevant laws, and regulations;
• Annual business plans of all Business Units are reviewed and approved by the Group Senior Management 
Team;
• Group budgets are reviewed and approved by the Board;
• Regular operational meetings at Business Units are held to review the operational and key performance 
indicators against the approved budget;
• Utilisation of contract tendering and evaluation process for large projects; and
• Weekly report on Group’s cash position is monitored by Group Treasury.
Periodic site visits to operating units are undertaken by Group Senior Management Team and/or the members of 
the Board whenever deemed appropriate.
The Group’s system of risk management and internal control applies principally to Wasco Berhad and its subsidiaries. 
Associate companies and joint ventures are excluded because the Group does not have full management control 
and/or majority Board representation.
This statement is duly approved by the Board at the Board of Directors’ meeting held on 28 February 2025.
REVIEW OF THIS STATEMENT
As required by Paragraph 15.23, Chapter 15 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities 
Berhad, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control. Their limited 
assurance review was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guides (“AAPG”) 3 issued by 
the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to form an opinion on the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Group.

(a) Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable 
steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making 
of provision for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off 
and that adequate provision had been made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) to ensure that any current assets, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business 
including the values of current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the 
Company had been written down to an amount which the current assets might be expected so to realise.
(b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful 
debts inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company misleading; or
(iii) which have arisen which would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or 
liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate.
(c) At the date of this report:
(i) there are no charges on the assets of the Group and of the Company which have arisen since the end of 
the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; and
(ii) there are no contingent liabilities in the Group and in the Company which have arisen since the end of 
the financial year.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF WASCO BERHAD
(Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No. 199901020946 (495846-A)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements of Wasco Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give 
a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their 
financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of 
financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of comprehensive 
income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the 
financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policies, as set out 
on pages 179 to 300.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards 
on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for 
the audit of the financial statements” section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, 
Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards 
Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Our audit approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in 
the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors 
made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed 
the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether 
there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting 
processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

(Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No. 199901020946 (495846-A)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
1.0 Impairment assessment for goodwill of CGU A and CGU B 
Refer to Note 6 - Goodwill and other Intangible Assets 
to the financial statements.
As at 31 December 2024, the Group’s goodwill totalled 
RM154.3 million which is allocated to the following 
cash generating units (“CGU”):
• Specialised Pipe Coating and Corrosion Protection 
Services (CGU A); and
• EPC, Fabrication and Rental of Gas Compressors 
and Process Equipment (CGU B).
We focused on this area due to the size of goodwill 
and because the recoverable amounts of CGUs are 
determined based on value in use (“VIU”) calculations 
which involve significant judgements in determining 
key assumptions on future cash flows generated 
from these CGUs.
Audit procedures performed over this key audit 
matter were as follows:
• Involved our valuation specialist to assess the 
appropriateness of the valuation methodology 
used by management;
• Involved our valuation specialist to evaluate 
the appropriateness of the discount rates used 
for CGU A and CGU B. In addition to this, our 
valuation specialist benchmarked discount rates 
used by management to comparable peers in 
similar industries, adjusted for business risk and 
marketability to ascertain reasonableness of 
discount rates used;
• Tested mathematical accuracy of VIU calculations 
prepared by management;
• Compared forecasted revenues to past performance 
results, market outlook and management’s 
expectation of market developments;
• Compared terminal growth rates to external 
macroeconomic sources of data and industry 
specific trends;
• Assessed reasonableness of probabilities of 
occurrence assigned to best, base and worst case 
scenarios for CGU A; and
• Assessed reasonableness of probabilities of 
occurrence assigned to base and worst case 
scenarios for CGU B; 
• We also considered the adequacy of disclosures in 
the financial statements of key assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis for the CGU.
Based on procedures performed, no material 
exception was noted.

(Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No. 199901020946 (495846-A)
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the 
Directors’ Report, Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control and other sections of Annual Report 2024, 
but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and 
we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to 
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, 
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also 
responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing 
the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the 
Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ 
report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an 
audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error 
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Group’s and of the Company’s internal control. 
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates 
and related disclosures made by the Directors. 
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based 
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that 
may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the 
related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease 
to continue as a going concern. 
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
(f) Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the Group 
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed 
for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our 
audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought 
to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in 
the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore 
the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to 
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

 Recognition and measurement
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any.
 Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an indefinite life. Capital work-in-progress and assets under 
construction included in plant and equipment are not depreciated until these assets are ready for their 
intended use.
 Depreciation is calculated to write off the depreciable amount on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful lives. The depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value from cost. The estimated 
useful lives of the property, plant and equipment are as follows:
 Buildings 10 - 50 years
 Plant, machinery, tools and equipment 2 - 25 years
 Electrical installations, computer and office equipment, furniture and fittings 3 - 10 years
 Motor vehicles 3 - 5 years
 Renovation, yard development and store extension 2 - 50 years
 The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the 
end of each financial year.

 Key estimates
 The determination of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods involves estimates and 
assumptions and is reviewed annually. Any changes to useful lives or any other estimates or assumptions, 
including the expected impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, may affect 
prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values.
 Impairment assessment
 The Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset with its recoverable amount. 
Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell for that asset and its value-
in-use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there 
are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
groups of assets (cash-generating units).
 For certain plant and equipment, fair value less cost to sell is determined based on estimates prepared by 
an independent expert. The fair value is estimated based on comparison of market transacted price for 
similar plant and equipment, and where necessary, adjusted for age, usage and conditions of the plant and 
equipment and expectation of future market outlook of the industry due to the uncertainty of the future 
economic condition.
 During the financial year ended 31 December 2024, there was a demobilisation of an idle plant and machinery 
located in Europe. As the assets were not expected to generate future economic benefits to the Group, the 
Group has decided to fully impair the idle assets, amounting to RM25,215,000. Accordingly, impairment 
charge of RM25,215,000 (2023: RM1,847,000) was recognised in the profit or loss.
 Derecognition
 Property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are 
expected from their use. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying 
amounts and are included in the profit or loss in the financial year the asset is derecognised.

 Recognition and measurement
 The Group leases various offices, yards and motor vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed 
periods of 2 to 13 years (2023: 2 to 14 years), but may have extension options. Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, comprising the following: 
• the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, 
• any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, 
• any initial direct costs, and 
• restoration costs.

4 LEASES (CONTINUED)
(a) Right-of-use assets (continued)
 Recognition and measurement (continued)
 Contracts might contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in 
the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, 
for leases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate lease and 
non-lease components, and it accounts for these instead as a single lease component. Lease terms are 
negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease 
agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are 
held by the lessor. Leased assets cannot be used as security for borrowing purposes.
 Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the remaining period of the respective leases ranging from 1 to 
90 years (2023:1 to 91 years).
 Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term 
on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use 
asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. 
 Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles, and all leases of low-value 
assets, are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are 
leases with a lease term of 12 months or less without a purchase option. Low-value assets comprise IT 
equipment and small items of office furniture.
 The title deeds to certain leasehold land of the Group with the carrying amount of approximately 
RM17,768,000 (2023: RM18,015,000) have yet to be issued by the relevant authorities.

4 LEASES (CONTINUED)
(b)  Lease liabilities (continued)
 Recognition and measurement
 Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid 
at that date. The lease payments are discounted using interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate 
cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. Subsequent to the initial 
recognition, the Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend 
on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments 
to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is remeasured and adjusted 
against the right-of-use assets. 
 The maturity analysis of the lease liabilities as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 43.
(c)  Leases as a lessor
 Minimum lease receivables on investment properties and equipment are as follows:

 Recognition and measurement
 The Group and the Company lease its investment properties under operating leases to non-related 
parties. The Group also leases its plant and equipment under operating leases to an associate.
 Leases of investment properties and equipment, where the Group and the Company retain substantially 
all risks and rewards incidental to ownership, are classified as operating leases. Rental income from 
operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
 For the financial year, operating lease income from lease contracts in which the Group and the Company 
act as a lessor totalled RM3,700,000 (2023: RM23,761,000) and RM963,000 (2023: RM1,592,000) 
respectively.

 Recognition and measurement
 Investment properties are properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both rather 
than for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, or sale in the 
ordinary course of business.
 Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, 
if any. Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and leasehold buildings are depreciated over the shorter of 
their estimated useful lives of 50 years or lease term.
 The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the 
end of each financial year.

 Impairment assessment
 The Group assesses whether there is any indication that the investment properties are impaired at the end 
of each reporting period. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset with its 
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell for that 
asset and its value-in-use. 
 During the financial year, there was RM Nil (2023: RM19,000) impairment loss recognised by the Group. 
 Fair value of investment properties is categorised as follows:

 Valuation processes
 The fair values of the investment properties above were estimated based on valuation by independent qualified 
valuers. The Group engages external, independent, and qualified valuers to determine the fair value of the 
Group’s investment properties and for other land and buildings at least every three years. The last external 
independent valuation of these land and buildings was performed on 28 March 2023. The fair value of the 
investment properties was determined by Hartamas Valuation & Consultancy Sdn. Bhd. As at 31 December 
2024, the Group has determined that there was no significant change to the fair value of these properties.
 The basis of the valuation adopted was based on the market comparison approach. The key inputs under this 
approach are the market evidence of transacted prices per square feet for similar properties in the area in 
which the values have been adjusted for key attributes such as property size, location and date of transaction. 
All resulting fair value estimates for properties are included in level 3. There was no significant change to the 
fair value of these properties.

6 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)
 Recognition and measurement
 
a) Goodwill
 Goodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment annually, or 
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried 
at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for 
the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of 
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill 
arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for 
internal management purposes, being the operating segments.
 Impairment assessment
 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. For the purposes of assessing impairment, goodwill is 
allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. 
 The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. These 
calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management 
covering a period of 5 years (2023: 5 years) based on past performance and their expectations of the 
market development. Terminal value is estimated at the end of the 5-year period.
 Value-in-use was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the CGUs based on 
certain key assumptions on the premise that there will be no material changes in the Group’s principal 
activities. The discount rates used reflect the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks 
associated with the CGUs of the Group.
 Due to the uncertainty of the future economic condition, management developed the best case, base 
case and worst case scenarios of cash flow projections. Probabilities of occurrence were assigned to each 
scenario to arrive at a single set of cash flow projection. The assumptions used in all three scenarios and 
the probabilities of occurrence assigned required management’s judgement.

 Recognition and measurement (continued)
b) Trademarks, technical know-how & intellectual property
 Separately acquired trademarks are shown at historical cost. Trademarks acquired in a business 
combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks have an infinite useful life 
and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment.
 Separately acquired technical know-how is shown at historical costs. Technical know-how acquired in a 
business combination is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Technical know-how has a finite 
useful life and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight line method to allocate the cost of technical know-how over its estimated useful lives of 5 years.
 Expenditure on acquired intellectual property is capitalised and amortised using the straight line method 
over their estimated useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years.
 Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGU”) identified according to operating divisions. 
The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the respective CGUs are as follows:
Group
2024
RM’000
2023
RM’000
Cash-generating units
Specialised Pipe Coating and Corrosion Protection  
Services (CGU A) 82,846 84,612
EPC, Fabrication and Rental of Gas Compressors and  
Process Equipment (CGU B) 71,466 73,168
154,312 157,780
 Significant estimates: Key assumptions used for value in use calculations
 The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections for CGU A under the best, base and worst case 
scenarios and CGU B under the base and worst case scenarios are as follows:
CGU A
(a) The revenue forecast for CGU A is supported by management’s forecasted projects, which is in line 
with past performance records, future market outlook and management’s expectation of market 
developments;
(b) Pre-tax discount rate of 18.3% (2023: 19.2%) was applied for all three scenarios, benchmarked against 
comparable companies at the date of assessment; and
(c) A terminal growth rate of nil (2023: 1.5%) was applied to the best and base case scenario (2023: base 
case scenario) while no terminal growth was applied to the worst case scenario.

 Significant estimates: Key assumptions used for value in use calculations (continued)
CGU B
(a) The revenue forecast for CGU B is supported by management’s expected projects, which is in line with past 
performance records, future market outlook and management’s expectation of market developments; 
(b) Pre-tax discount rate of 19.1% (2023: 17.5%) was applied for both scenarios, benchmarked against 
comparable companies at the date of assessment; and
(c) No terminal growth rate was applied to both scenarios. 
 Sensitivity
 CGU A and CGU B
 Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the 
carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount. 
7 DEFERRED TAX ASSETS/(LIABILITIES)
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and intends 
to settle either on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The following 
amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the statements of financial position:

 Recognition and measurement
 Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and other 
deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against 
which the tax losses, capital allowances and other deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Significant 
judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the 
likely timing and level of future taxable profits. Assumptions about generation of future taxable profits depend 
on the Group’s estimate of projected future cash flows. These judgements and assumptions are subject 
to risks and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, 
which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets recognised in the statements of financial position and 
the amount of unused tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and unutilised temporary differences that 
remain unrecognised. 
 Key estimates
 The Group concluded that the deferred tax assets will be recoverable using the estimated future taxable 
income of the subsidiaries of the Company. It is estimated that the secured project and unsecured project with 
high probabilities of successful award which will contribute to the future taxable income at the subsidiaries.

 Recognition and measurement
 In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is 
assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount.
 Subsidiaries acquired from other companies within Wasco Berhad Group as part of the group reorganisation 
is accounted for under the “Predecessor Accounting” method as these were entities under common control. 
Under the predecessor method of accounting, the subsidiaries are consolidated as if the subsidiaries have 
always been part of Wasco Berhad Group. Assets and liabilities acquired are not restated to their respective 
fair values and are recognised as the carrying amounts. The difference between any consideration given 
and the aggregate carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recognised as an 
adjustment to equity. No additional goodwill is recognised.
 Other subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method 
of accounting, subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group 
and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair 
value of the assets given, equity interests issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to profit or loss as and when incurred.
 The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, 
measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired at the date of acquisition is reflected 
as goodwill in the statement of financial position. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the 
Group’s share of identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the 
profit or loss.
 If a business combination achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured 
to its fair value on the date it becomes a subsidiary and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
 All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of 
the asset transferred. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with 
the Group’s accounting policies.

 Recognition and measurement (continued)
 Non-controlling interests represent that portion of the profit or loss, other comprehensive income and 
net assets of a subsidiary attributable to equity interests that are not owned, directly or indirectly through 
subsidiaries, by the Company. It is measured at the non-controlling’s share of the fair value of the subsidiaries’ 
identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition and the non-controlling’s share of changes in the 
subsidiaries’ equity since that date.
 Impairment assessment
 For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, due to the uncertainty of the future economic condition, the 
investment in certain subsidiaries of the Company was not expected to be recovered. The Group reviewed the 
recoverable amount of its investment by assessing the individual subsidiary, each of which is a single CGU by 
itself. 
 The recoverable amount was RM717,000 (2023: RM771,000) which is determined based on the net assets 
approach. The investment in certain subsidiaries are reduced to its recoverable amount. As a result, an 
impairment loss of RM35,054,000 (2023: RM3,789,000) was recognised in the profit and loss. 
 The movements in the allowance for impairment losses of investment in subsidiaries during the financial year 
are as follows:

 Recognition and measurement
 Investment in associates is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method 
of accounting. Equity accounting is discontinued when the carrying amount of the investment in an associate 
diminishes by virtue of losses to zero, unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes 
recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised.
 Impairment assessment
 The carrying amount of investments in associates are compared to their recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount was determined using their value-in-use. The value-in-use is the net present value of the projected 
future cash flows to be derived from that asset. Projected future cash flows are calculated based on historical 
sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, changes in technology and other 
available information. Due to the uncertainty of the future economic condition, management developed 
the best case, base case and worst case scenario of cash flow projections. Probabilities of occurrence were 
assigned to each scenario to arrive at a single set of cash flow projection. The assumptions used in all three 
scenarios and the probabilities of occurrence assigned required management’s judgement. 
(a) Quoted shares – Petra Energy Berhad
 As at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023, the fair values of the Group’s investment in quoted 
shares were based on Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
 The market value of the Group’s interest in quoted shares, representing its fair value as at 31 December 
2024, was approximately RM114,246,000 (2023: RM82,223,000). This fair value is approximately 
RM8,082,000 (2023: RM30,331,000) below the carrying value, giving rise to an impairment indicator on 
the carrying value of the investment of RM122,328,000 (2023: RM112,554,000).

(a)  Quoted shares – Petra Energy Berhad (continued) 
 As the fair value less costs of disposal is lower than the value-in-use of the investment, the Group 
has determined the recoverable amount of the investment using discounted cash flows expected to be 
generated from the investment. The calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial 
budgets approved by the Group covering a period of 5 years (2023: 5 years) based on past performance 
and management’s expectations of market development. Terminal value is estimated at the end of the 
5-year period.
 Due to the uncertainty of the future economic condition, management developed the best, base case and 
worst case scenario of cash flow projections. Probabilities of occurrence were assigned to each scenario 
to arrive at a single set of cash flow projection. The assumptions used in all three scenarios and the 
probabilities of occurrence assigned required management’s judgement.
 The key assumptions used in the cash flow projections to determine the recoverable amount for the 
investment under the best, base case and worst case scenarios are as follows:
(i) The revenue forecast is supported by management’s expected projects, which is in line with 
past performance records, future market outlook and management’s expectation of market 
developments;
(ii) Pre-tax discount rate of 14.5% (2023: 18.5%) was applied for all three scenarios, benchmarked 
against comparable companies at the date of assessment; and 
(iii) A terminal growth rate of nil (2023: Nil) was applied across all three scenarios. 
 The value-in-use is above the carrying value of the Group’s investment in quoted shares. As such, no 
impairment loss is deemed necessary to be recognised in the financial year ended 31 December 2024 
(2023: RM Nil).
 Sensitivity
 As at 31 December 2024, an increase of 0.6% in pre-tax discount rate, with all other inputs remaining 
constant, the estimated recoverable amount will be equal to the carrying value.
(b) Impairment of investment in associates

 Credit risk concentration profile
 The Group determines concentration of credit risk by monitoring the business segment of its trade receivables 
on an ongoing basis. The credit risk concentration profile of the Group’s trade receivables at the reporting 
date is as follows:
Group

Bioenergy Services 38,463 35,233
Trading 43,367 -
Total 530,039 444,041
 Concentration of credit risk is low within the Energy Services segment which primarily trade with oil majors. 
However, the Group considers the risk of default by these oil majors to be minimal given their relative size 
and financial strength. There is no concentration of credit risk within the Bioenergy Services and Trading as 
the balances are distributed over a large number of customers.

 The Company did not hold any derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2024 (2023: Nil).
 Recognition and measurement
 A derivative financial instrument is initially recognised at its fair value on the date the contract is entered into 
and is subsequently carried at its fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. 
Gains or losses on derivatives that are not designated as a hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss 
within ‘other gains/(losses) - net’. The Group and the Company currently do not hedge any of its derivative 
financial instruments.
 Forward currency contracts
 The Group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to protect the Group from movements in exchange 
rates by establishing the rate at which a foreign currency asset or liability will be settled. Forward currency 
contracts are mainly used to hedge certain trade receivables and trade payables denominated in United 
States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Ringgit Malaysia, and Indonesian Rupiah for which firm commitments existed 
at the reporting date, extending to June 2026.
 Gains or losses arising from fair value changes of its financial assets and financial liabilities
 During the financial year, the Group recognised a loss of RM9,976,000 (2023: RM1,374,000) in the profit or loss 
arising from fair value changes of its derivative financial assets and liabilities. The method and assumptions 
applied in determining the fair value of derivatives are disclosed in Note 44.

cancelled are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from equity attributable to owners 
of the Company. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of 
treasury shares. When treasury shares are reissued by resale, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable 
to owners of the Company. An amount equivalent to the original purchase cost of the treasury shares will be 
deducted from retained earnings upon the distribution of any treasury shares as share dividends.

25 LOANS AND BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)
 Recognition and measurement
 Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the 
activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditure and borrowing 
costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended or ceased when substantially all the 
activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are interrupted or completed.
 All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method in the period they 
are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group and the Company incurred in 
connection with the borrowing of funds.

 Recognition and measurement
 The Group recognises the estimated liability to repair or replace products when the underlying products or 
services are sold. The provision is calculated based on historical warranty data and specific circumstances 
related to products or services sold, after considering the various possible outcomes against their associated 
probabilities. It is expected that most of these costs will be incurred over the warranty period which extends 
up to 4 years (2023: 4 years).

(i) Contract revenue 
 Contract revenue with customers include contracts relating to pipe coating and manufacturing of 
boilers as well as engineering and fabrication services. 
 These contracts may include multiple performance obligations as they are not highly integrated. 
Hence, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the 
standalone selling price. 
 Where the contracts are highly integrated, they are recognised as a single performance obligation. 
Revenue is recognised progressively based on the progress towards complete satisfaction of the 
performance obligation.

27 GROSS REVENUE (CONTINUED)
(a) Revenue from contracts with customer (continued)
(i) Contract revenue (continued)
 Revenue are recognised over time when control of the asset is transferred over time when the 
Group’s performance: 
• creates and enhances an asset that the customer controls as the services are being performed; 
or 
• does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable 
right to payment for performance completed to date. 
 The progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured based 
on one of the following methods that best reflect the Group’s performance in satisfying the 
performance obligation: 
• direct measurements of the value transferred by the Group to the customer (eg. surveys of 
performance completed to date); or
• the Group’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation (eg. by reference 
to cost incurred up to the end of the reporting period as a percentage of total estimated costs 
for complete satisfaction of the contract).
 Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress, based on 
the extent of contract costs incurred. Significant judgement is required in the estimation of the 
progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation based on the extent of contract 
costs incurred over the estimated budget cost and the recoverability of the construction contracts. 
The estimated contract costs to completion is based on estimated and approved budgets, which 
require assessment and judgements to be made on changes in, for example, work scope, costs and

 Recognition and measurement
 Current tax expense is determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group and the 
Company operate and include all taxes based upon the taxable profits after taking into consideration available 
tax incentives.
 Current taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised 
outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
 The numerical reconciliation between the tax expense and the product of accounting profit multiplied by the 
statutory tax rate is as follows:

33 EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OWNERS OF THE COMPANY
 The basic earnings per share for the financial year was calculated by dividing the Group’s profit attributable 
to owners of the Company for the financial year of RM153,045,000 (2023: RM108,402,000) by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue, after adjusting for the effects of treasury shares during the 
financial year.

Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 774,311 774,311
Basic/diluted earnings per ordinary share (sen) 19.77 14.00 
 The effects of (loss)/profit from discontinued operation have no significant impact to the basic/diluted earnings 
per ordinary share attributable to the owners of the Company. 
 There are no potential ordinary shares issued by the Company, thus there is no dilution in earnings per share.
34 DIVIDENDS
 On 28 February 2025, the Directors declared a first interim single tier cash dividend of 2.00 sen per share 
amounting to approximately RM15,498,000 for the financial year ended 31 December 2024. The entitlement 
date was on 20 March 2025 and was paid on 3 April 2025. This dividend will be accounted for in equity as an 
appropriation of retained earnings in the financial year ending 31 December 2025.
 The Directors did not declare any dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. 
 Recognition and measurement
 Dividend distribution to owners of the Company is debited directly to equity and the corresponding liability 
is recognised in the period in which the dividends are approved. Liability is recognised for the amount of any 
dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Group, on or before 
the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

 Included within staff costs are remuneration of Executive Directors of the Group and the Company (Note 39).
 Recognition and measurement
(a) Short term benefits
 Salaries, wages, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as an expense in the financial 
year in which the services are rendered by employees. Short term accumulating compensated absences 
such as paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees that increase their 
entitlements to future compensated absences, and short term non-accumulating compensated absences 
such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occur. Non-monetary benefits such as medical 
care, housing and other staff related expenses are charged to the profit or loss as and when incurred.
(b) Post-employment benefits
 The Group has post-employment benefit schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in 
the countries in which it operates. These post-employment benefit schemes are defined contribution 
plans.
 A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a 
separate entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions  
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee services in 
the current and prior periods.
 As required by law, the Company and its subsidiaries in Malaysia make contributions to the Employees 
Provident Fund (“EPF”) which is a defined contribution plan, whereas subsidiaries in other countries 
make their respective local contributions, if required by law.
 Such contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss in the financial year to which they 
relate.

41 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS 
 For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their products and services. 
 The Group’s operating segments comprise:
(a) Energy services division: Pipe coating, pipe manufacturing for the oil and gas industry, building and 
operating offshore/onshore field development facilities and the provision of highly specialised equipment 
and services to the power generation, oleochemical and petrochemical industries.
(b) Bioenergy services division: Supplier and manufacturer of specialised equipment for biomass power 
plants; such as industrial fans, boilers and turbines that run primarily on biomass fuels.
(c) Trading division: Trading and distribution of building materials and the manufacturing and trading of 
industrial pipes for the construction industry. The Group had decided to divest its Trading businesses 
in the financial year ended 31 December 2023. During the financial year, the Trading business was 
classified as continuing operations as disclosed in Note 21(a). 
(d) Others: All other units within the Group that do not constitute a separately reportable segment.
 Management monitors the operating results of its divisions separately for the purpose of making decisions 
about resource allocation and performance assessment. Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The Group Chief 
Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker as he is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the Group’s operating segments. Segment performance is evaluated 
based on revenue and profitability measures as shown in the table below. 
 Transactions between segments were entered into in the normal course of business and were established on 
agreed terms. The effects of such inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
 The assets are allocated based on the operations of the respective segments. The amounts provided to the 
Group Chief Executive Officer with respect to total assets are measured in a manner consistent with the 
disclosure of segment assets below.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024
42 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY (CONTINUED)
(a) Financial assets
 Classification
 The Group and the Company classify its financial assets as fair value through profit or loss and at 
amortised cost. The classification depends on the nature of the entity’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
 The Group and the Company reclassify debt investments when and only when its business model for 
managing those assets changes. 
 Recognition and initial measurement
 Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction cost that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition of the financial assets except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. 
Transaction costs for financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised 
immediately as expenses within profit or loss.
 Subsequent measurement
(i) Debt instruments at amortised cost
 After initial recognition, financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where 
those cash flows represent solely payment of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly 
in profit or loss. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 
(ii) Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss
 Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or 
fair value through other comprehensive income are measured at fair value through profit or loss. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss within ‘other 
gains/(losses) – net’. Exchange differences, interest and dividend income on financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are recognised separately in profit or loss.
(iii) Equity instruments
 The Group and the Company subsequently measure all equity investments at fair value. Where 
the Group’s and the Company’s management have elected to present fair value gains and losses 
on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of 
fair value gains or losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends 
from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the 
Group’s and the Company’s right to receive payments is established. Changes in the fair value 
of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss within ‘other  
gains/(losses) – net’.

(a) Financial assets (continued)
 Impairment of financial assets
 Impairment of financial assets are as disclosed in Note 43.
 De-recognition
 Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership. 
(b) Financial liabilities
 Classification
 Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability.
(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading 
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities held for trading include derivatives entered into by the Group and the Company 
that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria. Liabilities in this category are classified within 
current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be settled within 12 months 
after the reporting date. Otherwise, they are classified as non-current.
(ii) Other financial liabilities
 The Group’s and the Company’s other financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables, 
intercompany payables, dividend payable and loans and borrowings. Loans and borrowings are 
classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to 
defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
 Recognition and de-recognition
 A financial liability is recognised when, and only when, the Group or the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
 A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or 
the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated 
as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

42 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY (CONTINUED)
(b) Financial liabilities (continued)
 Initial and subsequent measurement
 Derivative financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value and subsequently stated at fair value, 
with any resulting gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. Net gains or losses on the derivatives 
include exchange differences.
 Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value net off directly attributable transaction 
costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
 Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
 For other financial liabilities, gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are de-
recognised. 
(c) Offsetting financial instruments
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of 
financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
The legally enforceable rights must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the 
normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
43 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
 The Group’s and the Company’s overall financial risk management objectives and policies are to ensure 
that the Group and the Company create value and maximise returns for its shareholders. Financial risk 
management is carried out through risk review, internal control systems, benchmarking to the industry’s best 
practices and adherence to the Group’s financial risk management policies.
 The main risks arising from the financial instruments of the Group and the Company are credit risk, market 
risk, and liquidity risk. Management monitors the Group’s and the Company’s financial position closely with 
the objective to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and of the 
Company. 
 The following sections provide details regarding the Group’s and the Company’s exposure to the above 
mentioned financial risks and the objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks.
 Credit risk
 Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial 
loss to the Group and the Company.
 At the reporting date, the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the 
carrying amounts of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position, including 
derivative financial instruments with positive fair values.

43 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 Credit risk (continued)
(a) Receivables
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group 
and the Company have credit policies in place to manage the credit risk exposure. The risk is managed 
through the application of the Group’s and the Company’s credit management procedures which include 
the application of credit evaluations or approvals and follow up procedures.
 The Group and the Company actively monitor the utilisation of credit limits to manage the risk of any 
material loss from the non-performance of its counterparties.
 Simplified approach for finance lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets (including 
intercompany trade balances)
 The Group and the Company apply simplified approach to providing for expected credit loss (“ECL”) 
prescribed by MFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all finance lease 
receivables, trade receivables and contract assets. The Group and the Company account for its credit 
risk by appropriately providing for ECL on timely basis. In calculating credit loss rate, the finance lease 
receivables, trade receivables and contract assets have been assessed based on credit risk categories 
and the days past due and adjust for forward-looking information.
 Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor 
failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group and the Company. The Group and the Company 
categorise a receivable for write off when a debtor fails to make contractual payments and the 
recoverability of the receivables is remote. Where receivables have been written off, the Group and the 
Company continue to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where 
recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss. 
 General 3-stage approach for other debt instruments financial assets
 ECL for other debt instruments financial assets at amortised costs, which include other receivables, non-
trade intercompany balances including amounts owing by subsidiaries, amounts owing by associates 
and amounts owing by joint ventures, time deposits and cash and bank balances are considered to have 
low credit risk, as there were low risks of defaults and historically there were minimal instances where 
contractual cash flow obligations have not been met.

43 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 Credit risk (continued)
(a) Receivables (continued)
 General 3-stage approach for other debt instruments financial assets (continued) 
 The Group and the Company use three categories to reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowance 
is determined for each of those categories. A summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group’s 
and the Company’s ECL model is as follows:
Category Group’s and Company’s definition of category
Basis for  
recognising ECL
Performing Debtors have a low risk of default and a strong capacity 
to meet contractual cash flows.
12 month ECL
Underperforming Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit 
risk or significant increase in credit risk is presumed 
if the forward-looking information and indicators 
available signify impairment to debtors’ ability to repay.
Lifetime ECL
Not performing Debtors’ ability to repay or likelihood of repayment 
is determined as fully impaired when it meets one of 
more of the credit-impaired indicators.
Lifetime ECL (credit 
impaired)
 Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL, by considering 
the likelihood that the debtor would not be able to repay during the contractual period, the percentage 
of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens and the outstanding amount that 
is exposed to default risk. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were made 
during the reporting period. 
 There is no loss allowance for other financial asset at amortised cost as at 31 December 2024 and 31 
December 2023, except for trade and other receivables, amounts owing by subsidiaries, amounts owing 
by associates and amounts owing by joint ventures. 
 For movement of allowance for impairment of trade and other receivables, amounts owing by 
subsidiaries, amounts owing by associates and amounts owing by joint ventures, refer to Note 13, 14(a), 
15 and 16(a) respectively.
(b) Intercompany balances
 The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the 
results of its subsidiaries regularly.
 As at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by

 Credit risk (continued)
(b) Intercompany balances (continued)
 Management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the recoverability of intercompany receivables 
are high. As at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023, the amounts owing by subsidiaries were 
considered performing, except for certain subsidiaries. For movement of allowance for impairment of 
amount owing by subsidiaries, refer to Note 14(a).
 Advances to subsidiaries that are repayable on demand and interest-free are classified as amortised cost 
in the Company’s financial statements because the Company’s business model is to hold and collect 
the contractual cash flows and those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. 
The Company applied 12 month ECL for these advances to subsidiaries. There is no loss allowance 
recognised on these advances to subsidiaries as all strategies indicate that the Company could fully 
recover the outstanding balance of the advances to subsidiaries. 
 Advances to subsidiaries in the Company’s separate financial statements are assessed on individual 
basis for ECL measurement, as credit risk information is obtained and monitored based on each advances 
to subsidiary. 
(c)  Derivative financial instruments
 Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with approved financial institutions and 
reputable banks.
 As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from derivatives 
financial assets is represented by the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position.
 In view of the counterparties being reputable licensed financial institutions, management does not 
expect any of the counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
(d) Financial guarantees
 The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted 
to certain subsidiaries. The Company monitors on an ongoing basis the results of the subsidiaries and 
repayment made by the subsidiaries.
 The maximum exposure to credit risk amounts to RM297,397,000 (2023: RM368,960,000) representing 
banking facilities utilised by the subsidiaries as at the end of the financial year.
 Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with the 
ECL model under MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and the amount initially recognised less cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers’, where appropriate.

43 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 Credit risk (continued)
(d) Financial guarantees (continued)
 As at 31 December 2024 and 31 December 2023, there was no indication that any subsidiary would 
default on repayment. All of the financial guarantee contracts are considered to be performing, have low 
risks of default and historically there were no instances where these financial guarantee contracts were 
called upon by the parties of which the financial guarantee contracts were issued to. Accordingly, no loss 
allowance was identified based on 12 months ECL.
 Financial guarantees have not been recognised since the fair value on initial recognition was not material 
as the probability of the subsidiaries defaulting on its banking facilities is remote.
(e) Time deposits and cash and bank balances
 Time deposits and cash and bank balances are placed with approved financial institutions and reputable 
banks. The likelihood of non-performance by these financial institutions is remote based on their high 
credit ratings.
 Market risk
 Market risk refers to the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and 
prices will affect the Group’s and the Company’s financial position and cash flows.
(a) Foreign currency risk
 Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will 
fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
 The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales and purchases that are denominated 
in a currency other than the functional currencies of the Group entities. The foreign currency in relation 
to these transactions is mainly denominated in United States Dollar.
 The Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by maintaining receivables and payables in 
matching foreign currencies. Foreign exchange exposures in transactional currencies other than the 
functional currencies of the operating entities are kept to an acceptable level.
 The Group also uses forward currency contracts to minimise exposure on currency fluctuations for 
which receipts or payments are anticipated more than one month after the Group has entered into a firm 
commitment for a sale or purchase. The forward currency contracts entered are in the same currency 
as the hedged item. It is the Group’s policy to negotiate the terms of the forward currency contracts to 
match the terms of the hedged item to maximise its effectiveness.

 Market risk (continued)
(a) Foreign currency risk (continued)
 At the reporting date, the Group is mainly exposed to fluctuation in the United States Dollar exchange 
rate against the respective functional currencies of the Group entities. The Group considers a 5% 
strengthening or weakening of the United States Dollar as a possible change. 
 A 5% strengthening or weakening of the United States Dollar would result in profit or loss after tax and 
equity being approximately RM4,785,000 and RM10,000 (2023: RM3,124,000 and RM11,000) higher or 
lower for the Group and the Company accordingly. 
 The Group and the Company consider that the foreign currency risk attributable to currencies other than 
the United States Dollar to be insignificant.
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to foreign currency (a currency which is other than the 
functional currency of the Group entities and the Company) risk, based on carrying amounts as at the

43 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)
 Market risk (continued)
(b) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks
 Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in market interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a 
financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to interest rate risks relates primarily to the Group’s and the 
Company’s time deposits and interest bearing borrowings. 
 Surplus funds are placed with licensed financial institutions to earn interest income based on prevailing 
market rates. The Group and the Company manage its interest rate risks by placing such funds on short 
tenures of 12 months or less.
 The Group and the Company generally borrow principally on a floating rate basis and ensure that interest 
rates obtained are competitive. 
 The interest rate profile of the Group’s and the Company’s significant interest-bearing financial 
instrument have been presented in Notes 14, 16, 18 and 25.
 Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments
 The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss, and the Group does not designate derivatives as a fair value hedge. Therefore, a change in 
interest rates for these financial instruments at the end of the reporting period would not affect profit or 
loss.
 Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
 At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points lower/higher, with all other variables 
held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss after tax and equity would have been 
approximately RM2,534,000 and RM Nil (2023: RM3,335,000 and RM225,000) higher/lower, arising mainly 
as a result of lower/higher interest expense on floating rate borrowings. The assumed movement in basis 
points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment.
 Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as 
they fall due. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its trade and 
other payables and loans and borrowings. The Group and the Company maintain a level of cash and cash 
equivalents and bank facilities deemed adequate by the management to ensure, as far as possible, that it will 
have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due.
 As at 31 December 2024, there are sufficient facilities available that can be used to refinance borrowings, 
capital expenditure and general working capital requirements of the Group and the Company. Details of 
liquidity risk are disclosed in Note 25 to the financial statements.

44 FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities classified within current assets and current liabilities 
respectively approximate their fair values due to the relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.
 The fair values of forward exchange contracts are estimated by discounting the difference between the 
contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-
free interest rate.
 Fair values of non-derivative financial liabilities are calculated based on the present value of future principal 
and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.
 The carrying amount of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost approximates their respective fair 
values.
 Fair value hierarchy
 The table below summarises all financial instruments carried at fair value as at 31 December 2024 and 
31 December 2023, based on a hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in measuring its 
respective fair values. The levels are defined as follows:
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 
Level 3: Inputs for the financial asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs).

45 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
 The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating 
and healthy capital structure in order to continue supporting its businesses, maximise shareholders’ value 
and sustain future development of businesses within the Group. The Group strives to monitor and maintain 
an optimal gearing ratio. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as loans and borrowings less time deposits, cash and bank balances. Total capital includes paid-up 
share capital and reserves attributable to owners of the Company. The Group’s net gearing ratio is 0.21 times 
(2023: 0.48 times).
 Under the terms of the major bank loans and borrowings, the Group is required to comply with certain 
financial covenants throughout the tenure of the bank loans and borrowings. The key financial covenants are 
consolidated gearing ratio, consolidated finance service cover ratio, debt to EBITDA ratio and net tangible net 
worth. The Group has complied with these financial covenants during the financial year and up to the date of 
this report.

 The authority to issue shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Companies Act, 2016 will provide flexibility 
and expediency to the Company for any possible fund raising involving the issuance or placement of shares to 
facilitate business expansion or strategic merger and acquisition opportunities involving equity deals or part 
equity or to fund future investment project(s) or for working capital and operational requirements, which the 
Directors of the Company consider to be in the best interest of the Company.
 As such, any additional cost to be incurred or delay arising from the need to convene a general meeting to 
approve such issuance of shares could be eliminated.
2. Proposed Renewal of Authority to Buy-Back its Own Shares by the Company
 The Ordinary Resolution 9, if passed, will allow the Directors of the Company to exercise the power of the 
Company to purchase and/or hold not more than 10% (ten per centum) of the total number of issued shares of 
the Company for the time being. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
unless earlier revoked or varied by ordinary resolution passed by shareholders at a general meeting.
 Please refer to Part A of the Share Buy-Back Statement dated 29 April 2025, which is accessible online on the 
Company’s website at www.wascoenergy.com, for information pertaining to Ordinary Resolution 9.
3.  Proposed Renewal of Shareholders’ Mandate for the Existing Recurrent Related Party Transactions and 
Provision of Financial Assistance
 The Ordinary Resolutions 10 and 11, if passed, will allow the Company to enter into recurrent related party 
transactions of a revenue or trading nature with the related parties and the provision of financial assistance 
in the ordinary course of business which are necessary for the day-to-day operations based on terms which 
are not more favourable to the related parties than those generally available to the public and are not to the 
detriment of the minority shareholders of the Company.
 Please refer to Part B of the Circular to Shareholders dated 29 April 2025, which is accessible online on the 
Company’s website at www.wascoenergy.com, for information pertaining to Ordinary Resolutions 10 and 11.
