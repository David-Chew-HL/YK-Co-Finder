TAN SRI (SIR) FRANCIS YEOH SOCK PING
PSM, KBE
Executive Chairman
The 2024 financial year saw another exceptional 
set of results for our Group, with revenue and 
profits continuing to hit new highs. 
Our dividend track record remained unbroken, 
with the 27 th consecutive year since listing on 
the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange in 1997. We 
declared two interim dividends amounting to 7.0 
sen per share in respect of the 2024 financial 
year, a 17% increase over last year. 
In keeping with our long-proven growth and 
expansion strategy,  our Group acquired a 53.19% 
stake in Ranhill Utilities this year. Ranhill Utilities 
is mainly involved in the water and power sectors 
in Malaysia, in addition to providing multi-disciplinary 
engineering services, synergistic with our Group’s 
existing areas of expertise. 
In terms of organic growth, YTL PowerSeraya 
was awarded the right to build, own and operate 
a 600-megawatt hydrogen-ready combined cycle 
gas turbine unit. The new plant will be at least 
30% volume hydrogen-ready, with the ability to 
be retrofitted to become 100% hydrogen-ready 
operationally. 
In line with this ongoing and critical pursuit of 
low carbon energy solutions, YTL PowerSeraya 
will also invest more than S$5 million to expand 
the amount of solar power generated at Pulau 
Seraya Power Station to 5 MWp, up from the 
existing 1 MWp. The increased capacity, which 
can produce a monthly average of 417 MWh under 
optimal conditions, would support more than 
1,000 four-room Housing Board flats monthly.
Operationally, the year under review continued 
to see challenging times for the UK water sector. 
The need for environmental performance and 
resilience is increasing as cost-of-living pressures 
continue to squeeze household budgets.

STRATEGIC & PERFORMANCE REVIEW
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

---- Page 9 ----
Economic Review
The Malaysian economy demonstrated resilience in 2023, 
achieving a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.7% despite 
a challenging external environment. This performance was 
supported by robust domestic demand, a recovery in tourism 
and improved labour market conditions. In 2024, growth 
accelerated to 4.2% in the first quarter and 5.9% in the second 
quarter, driven by improvements in domestic demand and exports 
(sources: Bank Negara Malaysia updates & reports) .
In the other major economies where the Group operates, the 
UK recorded modest GDP growth of 0.1% for the 2023 calendar 
year. The UK economy improved in 2024, expanding by 0.3% 
in the first quarter and 0.9% in the second quarter on a year-
on-year basis. Meanwhile, Singapore’s economy grew by 1.1% 
in 2023, with growth rising to 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively, in 
the first and second quarters of 2024 (sources: Singapore Ministry 
of Trade & Industry, UK Office for National Statistics updates & 
reports).
Meanwhile, global warming is associated with more extreme 
weather and, in the UK, will lead to drier summers and wetter 
winters. It is essential that we provide resilient water and 
wastewater services throughout these changes. We are proud 
to play our part in taking these challenges on.
River health is a priority and we are taking action to improve 
our performance. In common with other English water companies, 
every storm overflow on the Wessex Water network is now 
monitored – a world-leading position for the English water 
industry – and we are using AI to survey our sewerage network. 
These technologies are providing better visibility, data and alerts 
which will enable faster responses, allow for preventative action 
and guide our capital investment choices.
This dovetails with exciting new developments at home in 
Malaysia, with our formation this year of YTL AI Cloud, a key 
component of our digital transformation business, centered on 
the development and deployment of accelerated supercomputing 
power. This brings vast potential to fast-track Malaysia’s adoption 
and development of technological advances spurred by AI 
capabilities. 
The opportunities are virtually unlimited, from the creation of high-value, high-income job opportunities for Malaysians, to the 
development of our country as a leading AI and data center hub for the entire region and beyond, with a significant role to play 
in the global technology landscape.
Our Group achieved another strong year across all fronts, underscoring the effectiveness of our commitment to long-term strategies 
that ensure we can continue to create and deliver enduring, sustainable value. 
As we embark on a new year, the outlook for our Group remains robust and we will continue to pursue our growth and expansion 
targets whilst remaining focused on improving operational efficiencies, responsibly managing our carbon footprint and advancing 
new pathways for innovation.

STRATEGIC & PERFORMANCE REVIEW
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

---- Page 10 ----
COMMITMENT TO OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
YTL PowerSeraya sold 10,644 GWh of electricity for the financial year 
under review, an increase of 6% over last year. Demand and prices 
have stabilised in Singapore’s wholesale electricity market save for 
hotter months, which saw a surge in electricity supply commitments. 
Our retail business, Geneco, was also officially announced by the EMA 
as Singapore’s leading electricity retailer in the Open Electricity Market, 
holding a 28.5% market share as at 30 June 2024.
In the UK, the pattern of extreme weather continued over the last 
year and is likely to persist into the future. Within this context, 
exceptional rainfall impacted Wessex Water’s storm overflow discharge 
performance, resulting in a rise in minor pollutions. All storm overflows 
are now monitored and the data will inform ongoing work to eliminate 
spills, with AI technology being used to detect defects along many 
miles of sewer network to help speed response times and build more 
resilience into the system.
Wessex Water performed highly on environmental and leakage 
reduction, and has achieved the highest rating of four stars in the 
Environmental Performance Assessment from the UK Environment 
Agency this year, having responded with urgency to every potential 
pollution incident by doing its utmost to prevent such incidents from 
becoming serious.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Our Group achieved outstanding results for the year, with 
a 68% increase in profit after tax to RM3.41 billion and 
revenue rising to RM22.28 billion. Returns to shareholders 
rose during the financial year under review, with total 
dividends declared increasing 17% to 7.0 sen per share. 
Our power generation segment in Singapore registered 
another strong year due to healthier margins and lower 
interest expenses following early loan repayments. The 
water and sewerage segment in the UK turned in better 
revenue, driven mainly by newly secured contracts in the 
non-household retail market and the price increase allowed 
by the industry regulator.
We continue to generate about 96% of our revenue from 
overseas, from our key operations in the UK and Singapore, 
as well as investments in other countries.
DATO’ SERI YEOH SEOK HONG
Managing Director
STRATEGIC GROWTH & EXPANSION
During the financial year under review, our Group acquired a 
collective stake of 53.19% in Ranhill Utilities, which provides 
water services for the state of Johor and power generation via 
natural gas-fired and solar power stations in Sabah and Perak, 
as well as other utility businesses. This was a strategic 
opportunity to invest in a mature business operating in 
segments closely correlated with our Group’s existing core 
competencies, and complements our utilities portfolio 
geographically and operationally.
Across the causeway, in January this year, YTL PowerSeraya 
won the first Request for Proposal (RFP) under the Energy 
Market Authority’s (EMA) new Centralised Process framework 
to develop a hydrogen-ready combined cycle gas turbine plant. 
The new plant is targeted to be completed by the end of 2027 
and will be at least 30% volume hydrogen-ready, with the 
ability to be retrofitted to become operationally 100% 
hydrogen-ready in the future, aiding in emissions reduction. 
This is fully in keeping with our commitment to invest for the 
long term in low carbon technologies, infrastructure and 
advanced energy solutions, enabling us to continue to provide 
the best outcomes for our customers and communities where 
we operate. We are gratified by the faith and confidence placed 
in YTL PowerSeraya to build for the future and deliver this 
pioneering project in Singapore.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REVIEW

---- Page 11 ----
Wessex Water continues to exemplify the safe haven protection 
that regulated assets add to our Group. This year, Wessex Water’s 
regulated asset base (RAB) value increased 5% to £4.3 billion 
(RM25.8 billion) from £4.1 billion (RM24.4 billion) last year. 
DIGITAL ACCELERATION
In our digital transformation business, we continued to make good 
progress on the YTL Green Data Center Park in Kulai, Johor, with 
the first phase commencing operations in May 2024. We are 
progressing well with subsequent phases, which will be delivered 
in stages in accordance with our agreed commitments.  
The YTL Green Data Center Park will be the first data center 
campus in Malaysia to be co-powered by on-site renewable 
energy and we are developing the solar power generation facility 
of up to 500 MW to support the Park’s energy needs. 
As a cornerstone of our digital strategy, YTL Communications was 
recognised as a Malaysia Digital status company this year by the 
Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), affirming our 
commitment to digital transformation and innovation. We have 
continued to conceptualise and launch innovative plans and 
products to cater to subscriber needs. 
YTL Communications also formalised its role as a digital partner for 
the Geran Digital PMKS Madani initiative through Yes, aimed at 
supporting the digital transformation of MSMEs and SMEs by 
providing advanced digital solutions and connectivity options, with 
5G allowing businesses to digitalise their operations.
 
We continued to make good progress on our digital bank this year. 
We were awarded a digital banking licence from Bank Negara 
Malaysia in consortium with Sea Limited in April 2022, and expect 
to launch in the fourth quarter this year.
In December 2023, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA 
Corporation to build AI infrastructure at a meeting between  
Mr Jensen Huang, founder and Chief Executive Officer of NVIDIA, 
and Prime Minister of Malaysia, YAB Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim. 
Subsequently, in March this year, we formed YTL AI Cloud, a 
specialised provider of massive-scale GPU-based accelerated 
computing. We will also deploy and manage one of the world’s 
most advanced supercomputers on NVIDIA’s Grace Blackwell-
powered DGX Cloud – an AI supercomputer for accelerating the 
development of generative AI.
YTL Power is among the first companies to adopt NVIDIA GB200 
NVL72, which is a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system 
with fifth-generation NVLink. The supercomputer will be 
interconnected by NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand networking 
platform, which is designed for the most compute-intensive 
workloads. The YTL AI Supercomputer will surpass more than 300 
exaflops of AI compute, making it one of the fastest supercomputers 
in the world.
We are excited to bring this supercomputing power to the Asia 
Pacific region, which has been home to many of the fastest-
growing cloud regions and the most innovative users of AI in the 
world. The YTL AI Supercomputer will be located at the YTL Green 
Data Center Campus, placing it within 50 km from some of the 
world’s densest network interconnection points in neighbouring 
Singapore.
The development of a world-class accelerated computing platform 
has the potential to drive scientific research, innovation and 
economic growth, elevating Malaysia’s attractiveness as a hub for 
digital investment and ability to play a significant role in the global 
technology landscape. It also creates vital new opportunities for 
the development of sovereign AI cloud services and other critical 
digital infrastructure.
We are encouraged by the excellent strides made across our 
Group this year to bolster our resilience and adaptability, coupled 
with an ongoing drive to deliver innovative solutions and create 
lasting value for all our stakeholders. Looking ahead, the  strength 
of the foundations of our Group will continue to generate new 
avenues and opportunities to drive our future growth.

GROUP OVERVIEW
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS
OBJECTIVES & STRATEGIES
The YTL Power Group pursues the geographic diversification and 
expansion of its revenue base through greenfield developments 
and strategic acquisitions both domestically and overseas, focusing 
on regulated and other utility assets, and businesses correlated 
to its core competencies, with the goal of maximising stakeholder 
value and building and operating strong businesses that are viable 
and sustainable on a long-term basis.
The YTL Power Group derives the bulk of its revenue from operating 
various regulated assets under long-term concessions and/or 
licences and other utility assets, enabling the Group to achieve 
stable earnings and mitigate the downside risks arising from 
economic uncertainties or changing operating conditions, both in 
Malaysia and globally. 
The principal components of the YTL Power Group’s strategy 
comprise:
• Diversification and expansion of the Group’s revenue 
base through both greenfield projects and strategic 
acquisitions in Malaysia and overseas, particularly in 
the area of regulated utilities 
The YTL Power Group pursues a strategy of acquiring regulated 
assets operating under long-term concessions. The Group’s 
existing overseas operations in this area continue to generate 
steady returns and its overseas acquisitions diversify income 
streams, enabling the Group to mitigate single-country and 
single-industry risks. 
• Growth and enhancement of the YTL Power Group’s 
core businesses with a focus on renewable & sustainable 
energy solutions
The Group’s strategy to continue to grow its businesses is to 
leverage its expertise in its core competencies, particularly in 
the areas of power generation, water and sewerage services, 
merchant multi-utilities and telecommunications. 
This includes investing in more sustainable renewable energy 
solutions. In implementing its strategy, the Group focuses 
strongly on governance, compliance and managing the economic, 
environmental and social impacts of its businesses to ensure 
the long-term sustainability and viability of its operations.
• Development of superior asset quality with increasing 
regulatory asset value over time 
The YTL Power Group’s regulated assets demonstrate ongoing 
growth, with the regulated asset value of these assets increasing 
over time. Wessex Water’s regulatory capital value, for example, 
has grown from GBP1.3 billion (approximately RM7.7 billion) 
when it was acquired by YTL Power in 2002 to GBP4.3 billion 
(approximately RM25.8 billion) as at 30 June 2024. 
• Ongoing optimisation of the Group’s capital structure  
The YTL Power Group maintains a balanced financial structure 
by optimising the use of debt and equity financing and ensuring 
the availability of internally generated funds and external 
financing to capitalise on acquisition opportunities. A key 
component of the Group’s growth strategy is its practice of 
funding the debt component of its acquisitions and greenfield 
projects largely through non-recourse financing which has 
ensured that the Group only invests in projects that are 
commercially viable on a stand-alone basis.  
• Enhancement of operational efficiencies to maximise 
returns from the Group’s businesses and deliver high-
quality services to its customer base 
The Group believes that its utility assets on average operate 
within the highest efficiency levels of their industries and 
further enhances operational efficiencies where possible through 
the application of new technologies, production techniques 
and information technology, to deliver efficient, high-quality 
services to its customer base.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
(a) Power Generation
The Power Generation segment recorded lower revenue of 
RM15,241.2 million for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 
compared to RM16,217.0 million for the previous financial 
year ended 30 June 2023, mainly due to lower pool prices 
and partially offset by the strengthening of the Singapore 
Dollar.
Profit before taxation increased to RM3,686.7 million this 
year compared to RM2,464.0 million last year mainly due to 
better margins, lower interest expenses following early loan 
repayments and the strengthening of the Singapore Dollar.
(b) Water & Sewerage 
The Water & Sewerage segment recorded higher revenue of 
RM5,213.7 million for the financial year under review over 
RM4,265.8 million last year, mainly due to new contracts 
within the non-household retail market and an increase in 
price as allowed by the regulator, coupled with the strengthening 
of the Sterling. 
The increase in loss before taxation was mainly due to higher 
interest expenses. 
(c) Telecommunications
The Telecommunications segment recorded higher revenue 
of RM741.3 million for the financial year under review compared 
to RM600.6 million last year, mainly due to higher project 
revenue recorded.
The increase in loss before taxation was mainly due to higher 
operating costs.
(d) Investment Holding Activities
The Investment Holding Activities segment recorded higher 
revenue of RM1,088.1 million this year compared to RM807.1 
million last year, primarily attributable to higher interest 
income. 
Profit before taxation increased to RM755.4 million in the 
current financial year as compared to RM348.9 million last 
year mainly due to higher interest income as well as a fair 
value gain arising from the acquisition of shares in Ranhill, 
partially offset by a lower share of profits of investments 
accounted for using the equity method.

The dividends paid by the Company since the end of the last 
financial year are as follows:

The total dividend declared for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 amounted to 7.0 sen per ordinary share. 
The Board did not recommend a final dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2024.
Dividend Policy
The Board has not adopted a set dividend policy. It is the present intention of the Directors to continue to propose the payment of cash 
dividends on an annual basis, subject to future earnings and the financial condition of YTL Power and other factors, including the profit 
and cash flow position of the YTL Power Group, restrictions imposed by law or under credit facilities on the payment of dividends by 
members of the YTL Power Group and the availability of funds. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT & LIQUIDITY
The Group’s objectives when managing its capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are external debt covenants, such as gearing and debt service coverage ratios applicable to the Group, which are not onerous and 
these obligations can be fulfilled. As part of its capital management, the Group rigorously monitors compliance with these covenants. 
In addition, consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as 
net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings, as shown in the 
Statement of Financial Position) less cash and bank balances. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the Statement of Financial 
Position, plus net debt.

Statements in this Annual Report. 
Under Practice Note 17 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities, the Company is required to maintain consolidated 
shareholders’ equity equal to or not less than the 25 percent of the issued and paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) and such 
shareholders’ equity must not be less than RM40 million. The Company has complied with this requirement with total consolidated equity 
attributable to owners of the parent as at 30 June 2024 of RM20.1 billion. 
The Group maintains a level of cash reserves and bank facilities deemed adequate by management to ensure, as far as possible, that it 
will have sufficient liquidity to fund its business requirements and pay dividends to its shareholders. As at 30 June 2024, the Group’s 
cash reserves stood at RM9.8 billion (2023: RM10.2 billion).

SEGMENT OVERVIEW
YTL Power owns a 100% equity interest in YTL PowerSeraya, a 
Singapore-based energy company with a total licensed generation 
capacity of 3,100 MW, consisting of combined-cycle and co-
generation combined-cycle plants. As at 30 June 2024, YTL 
PowerSeraya’s registered generating capacity with Singapore’s 
Energy Market Authority (“EMA”) was about 2,650 MW.
Situated on Jurong Island, Singapore’s oil, gas and petrochemicals 
hub, YTL PowerSeraya is a diversified energy company with a core 
business centered on the generation and retailing of electricity, in 
addition to operating other multi-utility businesses comprising 
utilities supply (steam, natural gas and water), oil storage tank 
leasing and oil trading and bunkering. 
The Group is also undertaking the development of a solar power 
facility with a generation capacity of up to 500 MW in Johor, 
Malaysia. 
The Group acquired a collective stake of 53.19% in Ranhill towards 
the end of the financial year under review. The power generation 
activities of Ranhill and its subsidiaries (“Ranhill Group”) comprise 
two 190 MW CCGT plants in Rugading and Teluk Salut in Sabah 
and a 50 MW large-scale solar plant in Bidor, Perak.
POWER GENERATION
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
In Singapore, the Group sold 10,644 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of 
electricity for the financial year under review, increasing 6% from 
the previous financial year. Generation market share based on 
scheduled generation stood at 19.9% in 2023. The electricity market 
has stabilised which led to low volatility of prices in the Singapore 
wholesale electricity market except for hotter months, which saw 
a surge in electricity supply commitments.
The Group’s commitment to maintaining plant reliability has been 
demonstrated through the timely completion of both major and 
minor maintenance inspections on its combined cycle and co-
generation power plant units. Over the past few years, several key 
measures have been progressively implemented to significantly 
enhance plant reliability. These key measures include the conduct 
of Failure Mode Effect Analysis, Master Trip Logic Reviews and 
Single Point of Failure Analysis to minimise vulnerabilities and 
prevent forced outages, Root Cause Analysis to prevent recurrence 
of outages, and an Operational ‘Near-Miss’ Incident Framework for 
early detection and rectification of plant abnormalities.
The importance of maintaining high standards in quality, environmental, 
energy, health and safety, as well as cyber security management 
systems remains a key priority, and certifications have been attained 
in ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001, ISO45001, BizSafe Star and SS 
651, as well as audit compliance with the ISO50001 standard under 
Singapore’s National Environmental Agency’s Energy Management 
System (EnMS) requirement during the year. 
The Group’s continuous efforts in maintenance, sustainability, 
digitalisation and compliance underscore its commitment to 
operational excellence and sustainable growth, to achieve long-
term reliability, efficiency and safety in its operations while 
contributing to a greener future.
To support its digital transformation agenda, the division focused 
on three areas during the year under review. Application modernisation 
initiatives completed during the year included software upgrades, 
cloud migrations and re-platforming projects, which led to significant 
improvements in system performance and efficiency, increased 
scalability and enhanced overall security and compliance. Digitalisation 
and automation initiatives aimed at enhancing business capabilities, 
such as improved systems monitoring, contract management, and 
energy and trading risk management, were also undertaken, whilst 
data capabilities initiatives focused on establishing a comprehensive 
Data Governance Framework.

Retail
The Group’s retail brand, Geneco, held a total market share of 
13.4% (based on retail volume as a percentage of total system 
demand) for the financial year under review in the electricity retail 
market, comprising customers from the residential, commercial and 
industrial segments. Correspondingly, sales volume was 7,530 GWh. 
In the residential segment, Geneco has been officially announced 
by the EMA as Singapore’s leading electricity retailer in the Open 
Electricity Market, holding a 28.5% market share and serving 
170,355 active residential customers as at 30 June 2024.
For commercial and industry segments, the Small & Medium Business 
(“SMB”) Online platform, which enables SMB customers with single 
premises and load size of less than 20 MWh per month to sign up 
online seamlessly, saw an increase of 147 new SMB customers, 
bringing the total SMB Online customers to 270 as at 30 June 
2024. As part of this digitalisation journey, Geneco is also looking 
to expand its SMB online offerings to target single premises 
customers with energy consumption of up to 100 MWh per month, 
enhancing its reach to meet the needs of this segment.
In continuation of its eco journey with Power Eco Add-on – Singapore’s 
First-And-Only customisable green add-on (Renewable Energy 
Certificate or Carbon Credits) for an electricity plan – Geneco celebrated 
its sixth anniversary this year by offering complimentary first 6 months 
of the innovative green add-on to both new and existing Geneco 
residential customers who opt-in or upgrade to Power Eco Add-on. 
As at 30 June 2024, Geneco had 3,711 customers opting for Power 
Eco Add-on, with an increase of 303 customers during the year, 
contributing to an overall target of 6,800 customers by 2030. 
Fuel Management
The Group’s fuel management arm continued its journey towards 
becoming a Smart Oil Storage Terminal, marked by strategic initiatives 
that have contributed to a commendable performance this year. 
The focus on automating and digitalising operational processes, 
coupled with the current ongoing phased implementation of a 
Storage Terminal Management System, has enabled the use of data 
to enhance decision-making processes. This transformation aligns 
with the strategic imperative of achieving operational excellence.
These efforts saw the efficient management of 10.31 million metric 
tonnes of fuel oil and diesel, a significant increase from 8.24 million 
metric tonnes last year. The terminal also experienced an increase 
in berthing for bunkering and cargo vessels, with 969 vessels 
compared to 837 last year, and maintained an average berth utilisation 
rate of 52.97%, reflecting a commitment to optimal resource 
utilisation. Additionally, the division has ensured sufficient operational 
fuel and reserves for its power generation needs.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS
SEGMENT OVERVIEW
In the UK, YTL Power owns a 100% equity interest in Wessex Water, 
a regional water and sewerage business serving 2.9 million customers 
across a geographic area of approximately 10,000 square kilometres 
in the south west of England, including Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, 
most of Wiltshire and parts of Gloucestershire and Hampshire.
Wessex Water is regulated by the Water Services Regulation Authority 
(known as Ofwat), the economic regulator for the UK water industry, 
and holds a licence from the UK government under an instrument of 
appointment to supply clean water and treat and dispose of waste 
water from its operating region in the south west of England.
In Malaysia, the Group’s water supply operations comprise the 
activities of the Ranhill Group, which carries out water supply for 
the state of Johor. The Ranhill Group also has stakes in other 
water-related businesses.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
In the Group’s UK operations, the cost of living remained high 
throughout 2023 and many customers continued to experience 
economic hardship. Wessex Water responded by making support 
packages for vulnerable customers and those struggling to pay 
their bills more visible and easier to access. This included auto-
enrolling just under 5,000 eligible customers on to its schemes 
through data shares with the UK government. 
On affordability, Wessex Water remains committed to its pledge 
to end water poverty by 2030 despite the increasingly difficult 
economic context. Throughout the year, the division focused on 
boosting access to the wide range of financial support provided 
under its tailored assistance programme (tap) to ensure even 
more customers get the help they need.  
This ongoing focus on delivering great customer service resulted in 
Wessex Water remaining a leading performer in the range of relevant 
customer service metrics, including being the top water and sewerage 
company on Ofwat’s measure of customer experience, C-MeX. 
According to the latest data from the Consumer Council for Water, 
Wessex Water has the lowest rate of complaints in the water and 
sewerage industry, at 21.57 per 10,000 connections. This was 
significantly better than the next best performer (29.91) and 
vastly better than the worst performer (227.52).

STRATEGIC & PERFORMANCE REVIEW

---- Page 25 ----
Water quality improved across all relevant metrics for the regulatory 
year from an already high base and is expected to be industry-leading 
among water and sewerage companies on the Compliance Risk Index 
(CRI) – one of two measures used by the UK Drinking Water 
Inspectorate (DWI) to measure drinking water quality compliance.
Water discharge compliance from the division’s 18 water treatment 
and 290 water recycling centers remained very high at 99%.
With more extreme weather over the last year and such weather 
likely to be a feature of the future, Wessex Water is now using AI 
technology to detect defects, such as collapses and obstructions 
caused by wet wipes, along its many miles of sewer network to help 
speed response times and build more resilience into the system.
The past year has seen the demands of the public, media and 
politicians for healthier water courses  grow stronger. Within 
this context, exceptional rainfall impacted the division’s storm 
overflow discharge performance, resulting in a rise in minor 
pollutions. All storm overflows are now monitored and the data 
will inform ongoing work to eliminate spills, with tackling frequent 
spillers being the immediate priority.
Wessex Water continued to perform highly on environmental and 
leakage reduction, and achieved the highest rating of four stars in 
the Environmental Performance Assessment by the Environment 
Agency this year, having responded with urgency to every potential 
pollution incident by doing its utmost to prevent such incidents from 
becoming serious. Annual average leakage levels have been reduced

length that can be surveyed at any given time. The Marketplace and 
other ongoing activities, such as expanding use of nutrient markets, 
demonstrate Wessex Water’s commitment to competition, facilitating 
new ideas and working collaboratively on innovative solutions.
Wessex Water remains committed to delivering record levels of 
investment and working towards a future where rivers are 
healthier and no longer blighted by regular storm overflow spills 
and excess nutrients; where everyone is confident water supplies 
remain safe, clean and sustainable.

SEGMENT OVERVIEW
YTL Power owns a 60% stake in YTL Comms, which provides 
high-speed 4G and 5G services in Malaysia under the Yes brand. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
YTL Comms is steadfast in its mission to bring affordable and 
reliable Internet connectivity to all Malaysians. With a series of 
strategic initiatives and launches designed to empower consumers 
and enterprises across the nation, the company expanded its 
product offerings, forged new partnerships and introduced innovative 
solutions, further solidifying its position as a leader of 5G in Malaysia.
In January, Yes introduced Yes Power 35 , an industry-leading 
postpaid plan that sets a benchmark for affordability with the 
highest data quota in the price tier in the country - with 150GB 
of full-speed 5G and 4G data for only RM35 per month, making it 
the most economical choice in the market. It also comes with 
unlimited calls to all networks in Malaysia and the flexibility to use 
the data quota for both standard usage and hotspot sharing. Yes 
Power 35 quickly became a popular choice among users seeking 
affordable connectivity options. 
Additionally, the launch of the Yes Network Test Drive  gave 
potential customers a risk-free opportunity to experience the 
superior speed and coverage of Yes 5G for 30 days at no cost or 
commitment. This initiative was designed to build trust in Yes 5G’s 
network capabilities, featuring an innovative activation process 
aimed at converting trial users into long-term subscribers.
In conjunction with Chinese New Year, Yes celebrated with a special 
iPhone promotion , offering the most affordable iPhone plan 
that included uncapped 5G data for RM129 per month. This limited-
time offer also provided additional perks, with a choice of a 
complimentary 20W USB-C Apple Power Adapter or a discount of 
RM235 on the first bill for selected iPhone plans. Yes launched a 
new iPhone promotion in May 2024, allowing customers to save 
RM750 on the purchase of an iPhone 15 without contract obligations. 
The offer included a 30GB 5G prepaid plan, with 0% installment 
plans available through major banks.

For its business segment, Yes formed a strategic partnership with 
NetExperience and Actiontec Electronics to implement Malaysia’s first 
OpenWiFi deployment. This collaboration introduced advanced 
enterprise-grade WiFi architecture to empower SMEs and enterprise 
customers. 
Leveraging Actiontec’s class-leading hardware and NetExperience’s

performance, cost-effective WiFi solutions with features such as 
zero-touch provisioning and cloud-based management.
March saw the introduction of the innovative Nothing Phone 
(2a) through a range of postpaid plans tailored to meet the diverse 
needs of Malaysian consumers. The Yes Infinite+ Premium Plan 
offered the Nothing Phone (2a) at no additional cost with a 
subscription of RM118 per month, while the Yes Infinite+ Standard 
Plan provided the device for just RM10 per month with uncapped 
5G data, unlimited calls, and generous hotspot data allowances. 
An exclusive pre-order campaign with special gifts for customers 
who signed up by 8 March 2024.
YTL Comms was recognised as a Malaysia Digital status company 
by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), affirming its 
commitment to digital transformation and innovation in Malaysia.
April marked the launch of the SuperJimat Plan  which provided 
consumers access to the latest 5G smartphones starting from just 
RM35 per month. This package included 150GB of high-speed 5G 
data and unlimited calls, featuring popular brands like HONOR, 
OPPO, realme, vivo, and ZTE, available through a 24-month 5G 
contract. Yes also introduced the Gembiraya campaign in celebration 
of Hari Raya, offering customers a special reward of 44GB of free 
5G data, redeemable via the MyYes app. This reinforces the mission 
to make 5G affordable for Malaysians.
In a groundbreaking development, Yes unveiled Malaysia’s first AI 
and robotics-based advanced manufacturing deployment  
at Clarion Malaysia, powered by the Yes 5G Private Network. In 
collaboration with Cnergenz, this tailor-made solution harnessed 
robotics and AI to enhance production efficiency and quality, setting 
a new standard for operational excellence in the manufacturing 
and automation sectors. The initiative received strong support 
from Government and industry leaders, including Malaysia’s Minister 
of Digital, Gobind Singh Deo.
This year also saw the launch of the ASEAN Plus Roaming 
service, allowing customers to enjoy unlimited data roaming across 
11 Southeast Asian destinations with flexible passes starting from 
RM10. Customers could pre-book up to 30 days in advance and 
benefit from free cancellation up to 24 hours before activation. 
In July this year, Yes formalised its role as a digital partner for the 
Geran Digital PMKS Madani  initiative, aimed at supporting the 
digital transformation of MSMEs and SMEs by providing advanced 
digital solutions and connectivity options with 5G.
Yes also launched affordable 5G plans  for Samsung’s Galaxy Z 
Fold6 and Flip6 devices, further enhancing its consumer product 
portfolio. In addition, a promotion with Sooka was introduced, 
offering customers streaming access to the Paris 2024 Olympics, 
the Premier League and more at competitive prices, along with

SEGMENT OVERVIEW
The YTL Power Group is undertaking the development of green 
data centers in Malaysia and Singapore, as well as digital banking 
in Malaysia. In the UK, the Group is developing Brabazon Bristol, a 
380-acre residential and commercial project. 
The Group also has investments in power generation assets 
comprising a 45% equity interest in Attarat Power Company PSC 
(“APCO”), which owns a 554 MW power project in Jordan, and an 
effective interest of 20% in PT Jawa Power, which owns a 1,220 
MW power station in Java, Indonesia. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Data Centers
YTL Green Data Center Park
The Group has embarked on the development of the YTL Green 
Data Center Park in Kulai, Johor, with a capacity of up to 500 MW. 
This will be the first data center campus in Malaysia to be co-
powered by on-site renewable solar energy. To date, the Group 
has partnered with Sea Limited as a co-locator to anchor this 
world-class green facility, the first phase of which became operational 
during the financial year under review. Another phase has been 
contracted with a hyperscaler client, and the ensuing phases of 
the Park will be rolled out on a staggered basis.
 
The campus incorporates innovative and sustainable solutions in 
design and operations to achieve high-energy efficiency and is 
expected to serve a growing demand in the region for ecofriendly, 
cost-efficient data center solutions from hyperscalers and co-
location customers alike.
 
Progress is well underway on subsequent phases of the YTL Green 
Data Center Park, and will be delivered in accordance with planned 
timelines.
 
YTL AI Cloud
On 8 December 2023, YTL Power announced a collaboration  
with NVIDIA Corporation (“NVIDIA”) to build AI infrastructure, in a 
meeting between Mr Jensen Huang, founder and Chief Executive 
Officer of NVIDIA, and Prime Minister of Malaysia, YAB Dato’ Seri 
Anwar bin Ibrahim. 
 
On 18 March 2024, YTL Power announced the formation of YTL 
AI Cloud, a specialised provider of massive-scale GPU-based 
accelerated computing, and that it will deploy and manage one 
of the world’s most advanced supercomputers on NVIDIA Grace 
Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud – an AI supercomputer for 
accelerating the development of generative AI. 
YTL Power is among the first companies to adopt NVIDIA GB200 
NVL72, which is a multi-node, liquid-cooled, rack-scale system with 
fifth-generation NVLink. The supercomputer will be interconnected 
by NVIDIA’s Quantum InfiniBand networking platform. The platform 
acts as a single GPU with 1.4 exaflops of AI performance and 30TB 
of fast memory and is designed for the most compute-intensive 
workloads. The YTL AI Supercomputer will surpass more than 300 
exaflops of AI compute, making it one of the fastest supercomputers 
in the world.

---- Page 29 ----
The YTL AI Supercomputer will be located at the YTL Green Data 
Center Park and will help meet the demand for highly scalable, 
high-performance cloud-based solutions for AI/ML workloads. Its 
location in Johor also puts the facility within a 50-km radius from 
some of the world’s densest network interconnection points in 
neighbouring Singapore.
Digital Banking
In April 2022, the Group in consortium with Sea Limited was 
awarded a digital banking licence by Bank Negara Malaysia and 
work is well underway towards commencement of operations. 
 
This new venture, which will leverage multiple synergies between 
the Group and Sea Limited, will enable the Group to further 
contribute to the growth of Malaysia’s digital transformation and 
broaden access of its citizens to financial services, particularly the 
underserved and underbanked, as well as micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs).
The digital bank is expected to commence operations in the fourth 
quarter of this calendar year.
Brabazon 
The Group is undertaking one of the UK’s largest master planned 
developments, located on the former Filton Airfield site. Brabazon 
Bristol is a 380-acre mixed-use urban development and the Group’s 
first UK property development project.
Awards won this year include the British Home Awards 2023 
(Regeneration Scheme) and the South West Business Masters 
2023 (Property Business) award.
Masterplan Densification
Planning approval from South Gloucestershire Council for the revised 
Masterplan application received consent this year, enabling significant 
densification of the development. The approval allows the new 
Masterplan to deliver up to 6,500 residential homes, student 
accommodation units, 4 million sqft of commercial floor area and 
approximately 1 million sqft of educational and community facilities. 
Residential 
The first phase at Brabazon, known as The Hangar District, 
comprising 302 residential units apportioned to 127 landed and 
175 apartment units, is currently being delivered. More than half 
of these homes are now completed and occupied. The remainder, 
which comprises mostly apartment units, are set to complete ahead 
of year-end. All open-market homes are sold in staggered releases 
and, to date, all have been sold off-plan with no voids accrued.
The next phase of 100 units of landed homes at Brabazon 
commenced construction with a similar staggered sales strategy 
to be adopted for the open-market homes. The first homes are 
scheduled for completion later in the year. The designs for the 
second phase retain many of the distinctive features that have 
made The Hangar District such a success. 
The Retirement Village approval for 229 units was also obtained 
this year. The development is orientated towards active elderly 
retirees who require minimum care and desire to be part of an 
urban community with walkable access to parks and the town 
center. The target market includes downsizers and parents who 
want proximity to family and convenience but, at the same time, 
independence. 
Student Accommodation
The application for the 1,514-bed Purpose Build Student 
Accommodation (“PBSA”) scheme was designed, submitted and 
received consent within the year. Given Brabazon’s connectivity via 
existing mobility infrastructure to established UK university campuses, 
the PBSA serves a market which is in high demand. These units are 
housed within four individual blocks with shared communal spaces 
such as study and game rooms, gyms and lounges that can host 
social gatherings, all of which interact with an outdoor landscape 
realm programmed with active and quiet zones.  The project is under 
construction, with the first phase targeted for completion in the 
third quarter of 2026 and the final phase a year later.

Community 
The Group commenced the construction and transformation of 
Hangar 16U, a Grade II listed aircraft hangar, into a new local, social 
community hub, designed to bring people together and promote 
active and sustainable living at Brabazon. 
Spread over two floors, the hub is programmed with a café, library 
and wellness center as the ground floor anchors. On the upper 
level, a large hall will be a social space for multi-faith groups and 
venue for public meetings and family events. A range of activity 
rooms will offer space for after-school clubs and community groups, 
while the wellness center will offer cardio machines, weight-training 
facilities and group sessions.
Infrastructure
The primary infrastructure construction maintains its momentum, 
with the focus on completing the connection to the Hangar District’s 
final phase in time for its handover. Authorities are progressing 
the Brabazon station tender, which is a design that has been 
upgraded to cater for YTL Arena Bristol, allowing up to 2,000 
people on event nights to travel to the arena by train. 
Commercial 
The development of YTL Arena Bristol, situated at the legendary 
Brabazon Hangars, the birthplace of the Concorde, is progressing 
well. The Arena will feature the region’s largest column-less 
exhibition and convention halls with 6,000 sqm of floor area, height 
clearance of 21 metres and banqueting capacity for 4,000, together 
with a flexible hub for entertainment, film, television and music 
rehearsals. 
YTL Arena Bristol will be at the heart of a vibrant new community 
at Brabazon. The project is in the final stages of technical design 
review with concurrent efforts at examining the project’s 
procurement and construction methodology. Work has completed 
on the new power supply station, whereas other key pieces of 
infrastructure required including new road connections are ongoing. 
The hazardous material removal was awarded and targeted to 
complete by the third quarter 2024.
APCO
In Jordan, YTL Power has a 45% equity interest in APCO, the owner 
of a 554 MW oil shale-fired mine-mouth power generation project. 
APCO has signed a 30-year power purchase agreement with the 
National Electric Power Company (“NEPCO”), Jordan’s state-owned 
utility, for the entire electrical capacity and energy of the power 
plant, with an option for NEPCO to extend the power purchase 
agreement to 40 years (from the commercial operation date (“COD”) 
of the project’s second unit).
Following the project successfully achieving COD during the last 
financial year, APCO continued to perform well for the year under 
review. 
The 554 MW power plant is the first in Jordan to utilise the country’s 
indigenous oil shale resources which will account for approximately 
15% of its installed power generation capacity. This will reduce 
the country’s import of oil products for power generation, and its 
development is a key milestone in the Jordanian government’s goal 
of furthering its energy independence.
Jawa Power
In Indonesia, the Group has an effective interest of 20% in PT 
Jawa Power, which owns a 1,220 MW coal-fired power station in 
Java, Indonesia. PT Jawa Power supplies power to Indonesia’s 
national utility company, PT PLN (Persero), under a 30-year power 
purchase agreement. Operation and maintenance (O&M) for the 
power station is carried out by PT YTL Jawa Timur, a subsidiary of 
YTL Power, under a 30-year agreement. PT Jawa Power’s performance 
remained stable during the year under review.

RISK MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS
The overall risk management objective of the YTL Power Group is 
to ensure that adequate resources are available to protect its 
assets and to create value for its stakeholders. Risk management 
is carried out through regular risk review analysis, internal control 
systems and adherence to the Group’s risk management practices. 
The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves the appropriate 
control environment frameworks.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, 
including market risk (comprising foreign currency exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital 
risk. The Group focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. 
Further details on the Group’s financial risk management can be 
found in Note 36 of the Financial Statements in this Annual Report.  
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Concessions & Key Contracts
A number of the Group’s businesses and projects are reliant, in 
some cases to a significant extent, on concessions or other key 
contracts. Cancellation, expiration, termination or renegotiation of 
any such concession or key contract or the imposition of restrictive 
regulatory controls could have an adverse effect on the financial 
condition and results of operations of certain subsidiaries of YTL 
Power and accordingly, the Group as a whole. 
However, the Group’s strategy of investing in regulated assets 
with long-term concessions or contracts has enabled it to establish 
a solid track record and operating performance to date, and is a 
measure to mitigate the vagaries of short-term contracts or more 
cyclical industries. Furthermore, the Group addresses these risks 
by investing in assets operating in stable economies and/or 
established markets or sectors with strong legal protections.
Business Risk
The YTL Power Group’s principal activities are subject to certain 
risks inherent in their respective sectors. These may include 
shortages of labour and raw materials, increases in the cost of 
labour, raw materials, equipment and electricity tariffs, changes 
in the general economic, business, credit and interest rate conditions, 
inflation, taxation and changes in the legal and environmental 
framework within which the industries operate. 
The Group addresses these matters by maintaining sound financial 
risk management practices as set out above, and high standards 
of preventive maintenance and cost efficiency coupled with technical 
and operating efficiency of its assets.
Dependence on Key Management
The continued success of YTL Power is, to a significant extent, 
dependent on the abilities and continued efforts of the Board and 
senior management of YTL Power. Key personnel with a strong 
background in the diversified areas of YTL Power’s principal activities 
are valuable assets to YTL Power. The loss of any key member of 
the Board or senior management personnel could affect YTL Power’s 
ability to compete in the sectors in which it operates. 
The future success of YTL Power also depends on its ability to attract 
and retain skilled personnel for smooth business operations of the 
Group to continue without undue disruption. Therefore, appropriate 
measures are taken which include the provision of training programmes, 
the offering of attractive incentives such as employees’ share option 
schemes and competitive remuneration packages, and efforts to 
ensure smooth succession in the management team. 
Political, Economic & Regulatory Risks
Like all other businesses, adverse developments in political, economic 
and regulatory conditions in Malaysia, Singapore, the UK, Indonesia, 
Jordan and other overseas markets in which the Group from time 
to time has operations or investments could materially and adversely 
affect the financial and business prospects of the Group and the 
markets for its products and/or services. 
Whilst it is not possible to prevent the occurrence of these events, 
the Group attempts to mitigate the effects of these risks through 
thorough due diligence assessments prior to the commitment to 
any project, ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations, 
as well as its strategy of maintaining the geographic diversity of 
its operations, and remaining vigilant in monitoring events and 
conducting ongoing assessments of any operational and financial 
impacts of such external developments.

RISK MANAGEMENT
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS
Environmental & Climate-Related Risks
The YTL Power Group’s businesses, and in particular its utilities, 
are likely to continue to be subject to environmental legislation 
and regulations, compliance with which could result in increased 
costs, or losses of or reductions in revenue, to the Group. The 
terms on which concessions for power and other utilities projects 
are granted by relevant regulatory authorities may include, on 
occasion, requirements to contribute to environmental and/or other 
public works. 
The YTL Power Group’s businesses are exposed to environmental 
and climate-related risks including transition risks, which may arise 
from legal, regulatory, policy, technological and market changes to 
address climate mitigation and adaptation, and physical risks 
resulting from climate change which may arise from extreme 
weather events or longer-term shifts in weather patterns, causing 
adverse impacts including operational disruptions and physical 
damage to assets. 
The Group has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that its 
businesses are viable and sustainable on a long-term basis. In the 
short term, the Group will continue to monitor, manage and offset 
its carbon emissions and optimise resource management, and take 
guidance from domestic and international policies to keep abreast 
of developments in climate change and environmental issues. Over 
the medium to longer term, the Group will continue to incorporate 
climate-related risks and opportunities into its business model, 
operations and engagements with various stakeholders. 
Further information on the Group’s actions in managing these 
matters can be found in the Environmental, Social & Governance 
Report 2024  in this Annual Report.

Global economic growth is anticipated to remain steady, supported 
by moderating inflation, resilient labour markets and a rebound in 
global trade. However, the global economic outlook remains subject 
to downside risks, including escalating geopolitical tensions, higher-
than-expected inflation and a sharp tightening in financial market 
conditions (source: Bank Negara Malaysia updates) .
Looking ahead, YTL PowerSeraya remains focused on customer 
service, operational efficiency and exploring diversification beyond 
the core business into integrated multi-utilities supply. Electricity 
is an essential service and demand in Singapore is expected to 
remain stable. 
Wessex Water will continue to work towards delivering its investment 
commitments agreed with the regulator until the next price review 
is published. Outside of the regulated business, exploration is also 
ongoing of low-risk opportunities for organic growth within Wessex 
Water’s wider UK operations.
OUTLOOK
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS
The outlook for the Group’s main operations in Malaysia remains 
stable. YTL Comms is well-positioned to pursue further growth of 
its subscriber base as the first mover in delivering innovative 5G 
services to its customers, offering highly affordable data plans, as 
well as successful collaborations. 
YTL Power will continue to advance its sustainability transition, 
particularly with the development of the 600 MW hydrogen-ready 
power plant, investments in solar energy and partnerships in clean 
energy solutions and green technologies.

together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as the “Wessex Group” in this 
report. 
We continue to work towards improving processes to track and gather our 
environmental data, in addition to continuing efforts to effectively 
standardise the data collected over different countries and industries in 
order to reflect our environmental indicators on a Group level. 
Consequently, environmental data figures may not be directly comparable 
to previous years due to ongoing efforts to expand the scope of reporting 
to include additional operating subsidiaries, as well as revisions in 
estimation methods. As such, this remains an area of ongoing development.
The workforce data refers to all employees of the YTL Power Group, 
unless specified otherwise.
The full list of our subsidiaries can be found in Note 14  of the Financial 
Statements in this Annual Report.
• Associated companies, joint ventures and other operations where we 
do not have financial and/or operational control are excluded. 
• Where material, newly acquired subsidiaries are included upon the 
completion and availability of a full year of data corresponding with 
YTL Power’s financial year, whilst any subsidiaries divested during the 
financial year are excluded from the report.

MATERIALITY
Due to the essential nature of the utility services that our Group provides, our key stakeholders encompass a broad range of groups across 
our operations. These include our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, investors, lenders, business partners, industry groups, 
local communities, regulators and governments in the countries where we operate. 
In carrying out this exercise, we reference the GRI reporting principles and guidance. We conduct materiality assessment exercises to help 
us identify the economic, environmental, social and governance issues that matter most to our business and our stakeholders. The 
assessment takes into account various factors including our business priorities, stakeholder feedback and the UN SDGs. Our material 
matters are reviewed and assessed annually as necessary to ensure their continued relevance.

Understanding the Context of our Material Matters
Whilst our Group operates in countries across the globe, the individual businesses are highly localised, with each key business segment 
generally operating in a single jurisdiction, area or region. As such, the materiality of ESG concerns, impacts and initiatives differs across 
business segments depending on their nature, and we then have a high-level Group-wide consolidation process to measure these matters. 
Therefore, the matters that are material to our water and sewerage business in the UK will differ from those that affect our power 
generation business in Singapore or our telecommunications business in Malaysia. The following table provides an overview to further 
explain this in the context of our Group and the focus of disclosures in our ESG Report.

Management of our Material Matters
Value creation by the YTL Power Group is intrinsically linked to our ESG strategy, risks and opportunities, and our alignment with the 
relevant UN SDGs. Our risk framework is identified and managed through a tiered system of groups drawn from operational staff, senior 
management, Executive Directors and the Board. The Board reviews and is ultimately responsible for risk and setting the risk appetite and 
tolerance. 
Risks have been identified evaluated and managed in line with our processes throughout the year. This section narrows the focus to 
highlight the ESG context, which forms a subset of our risk management framework, further details of which can be found in the 
Management Discussion & Analysis and Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control in this Annual Report.

Protection of the environment remains one of our core tenets and 
we place an important part of our focus on sustainable development. 
We recognise that the planet provides limited resources and as 
such the onus is on us to mitigate impacts on land, water and air 
through the responsible use of natural resources and sustainable 
operations.
CLIMATE & ENERGY
In line with our commitment to SDG 13 (Climate Action), YTL Power 
strives to assess and mitigate climate-related risks stemming from 
tougher climate regulations and higher carbon prices, and 
continuously updates efforts to reduce, mitigate and adapt to the 
effects of climate change. Our strategy remains focused on 
reducing emissions, enhancing energy efficiency and adopting 
renewable energy technologies towards a low carbon future.
Climate-Related Metrics & Targets
YTL Power is dedicated to progressing in a sustainable manner 
whilst taking precautionary approaches to minimise the potential 
risks to both our business and the environment, in accordance with 
the UN SDG principles relating to the environment. We strive to 
minimise our environmental impacts through our collective efforts 
in the areas of climate change and energy, waste and water 
management, resource management and biodiversity. 
We have set a high-level target for our Group to be carbon neutral 
in operations by 2050 , in line with the Malaysian Government’s 
goal. Given the diverse geographic location of our Group’s key 
businesses, some of our operations have already moved ahead, in 
line with technological advances, government incentives and 
regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions, and are expected 
to reach this goal sooner:
✓ In the UK, Wessex Water’s target is to achieve net zero 
operational carbon emissions by 2030  and net zero 
total carbon emissions (including supply chain) by 2040.
✓ In Singapore, YTL PowerSeraya is targeting a 60% reduction 
in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions (Scope 1) by 2030  
(from 2010 levels), carbon neutral (Scope 2) by 2030 and 
a net zero ambition by 2050 .
Strategic investment in protection of the environment has resulted 
in a growing portfolio of green investments, environmental 
technologies, GHG emission reduction measures, resource efficiency 
programmes and biodiversity conservation programmes across our 
Group. We are committed to the pursuit of new ventures, particularly 
in renewable and sustainable energy solutions, with a view to 
achieving our target as early as possible. This will be propelled by 
our key operations in the UK and Singapore, which are further 
along on this journey, driven by the climate progress being pursued 
in those countries.

YTL PowerSeraya’s 60-30 Vision
YTL PowerSeraya’s 60-30 Vision is to achieve a 60% reduction in 
Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, which it aims 
to fulfil through the following actions:
(i) Maximise energy efficiencies at existing combined cycle and 
co-generation power plants 
(ii) Improve emissions intensity by at least 10% from 2020 level 
by 2030 
(iii) Import at least 100 MW of low carbon electricity by 2030
(iv) Invest in low carbon power technologies such as hydrogen-
ready power generation 
(v) Secure eligible high-quality international carbon credits to 
offset at least 5% of its taxable emissions from 2024 onwards
YTL PowerSeraya also aims to be carbon neutral in Scope 2 emissions 
by 2030.
For FY2024, YTL PowerSeraya achieved an absolute reduction in 
direct emissions of about 41% from 2010 levels.
Wessex Water’s Routemap to Net Zero Carbon 
In 2020, water companies in England produced a routemap to 
achieving net zero operational carbon emissions by 2030. This was 
the first sector routemap of its kind in the world, and Wessex 
Water published its own detailed plan in mid-2021 to achieve net 
zero operational carbon emissions by 2030, alongside a goal to 
achieve full de-carbonisation by 2040, a decade ahead of the UK 
government’s 2050 target. 
The 2030 aim is not a science-based target, but we consider it to 
be aligned with the principles of the Paris Agreement and the 
United Nations Convention on Climate Change 1.5°C pathway. The 
targets and planning are also contextualised by the UK’s 2050 net 
zero aims and successive national carbon budgets.
The plan has three strands:
(i) Emissions avoidance e.g. further reducing leakage and 
encouraging water efficiency, use of lower carbon transport 
and promotion of low energy, nature-based solutions;
(ii) Optimisation measures e.g. improving energy efficiency and 
controlling process emissions; and
(iii) More renewable energy e.g. increasing generation from biogas 
and pursuing new opportunities for wind and solar power, 
both as generator and end user

Climate Scenario Planning
In identifying environmental risks, the Group is mindful of the various 
climate scenarios presented in the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. These 
climate scenarios consider both Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs), which project different levels of GHG concentrations, 
and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which represent changes 
in population, economic growth, education, urbanisation and the 
rate of technological development. 
YTL PowerSeraya conducted a scenario planning exercise in June 
2023 to review the potential impact of global climate change on 
Singapore’s power sector and its energy transition on a short, 
medium and long-term basis. The exercise incorporated the various 
IPCC AR6 climate scenarios as set out in Figure 1. 
YTL PowerSeraya also reviewed Singapore’s 2050 energy transition 
blueprint which takes a scenario-based approach to outline three 
plausible futures for a decarbonised energy sector in Singapore 
by 2050.

✓ Scenario 1 is the clean energy renaissance future with global 
cooperation and heavy investment in low carbon technology. This 
is the perfect world scenario where Singapore has access to a variety 
of clean energy by 2050. 
 Potential energy mix (by 2050):  40% electricity imports, 40% 
hydrogen, 10% solar, 10% geothermal 
✓ Scenario 2 is the climate action bloc future, where objectives-aligned 
countries collaborate on climate actions. Due to limited global 
investment, technological advancement in low-carbon solutions 
remains stagnant. This is a future where Singapore depends on 
electricity imports from selected partnered countries for its green 
energy and international carbon credits to offset hard-to-abate 
sectors. 
 Potential energy mix (by 2050):  60% electricity imports, 10% 
hydrogen, 10% solar, 20% natural gas coupled with 100% carbon 
credits to offset emissions from natural gas combustion
✓ Scenario 3 is the emergent tech blazer future where the world is 
multi-polarised, and investment in low carbon technology is limited 
to individual countries’ ambitions. This is a future where Singapore 
depends on imported hydrogen and potentially expands into nuclear 
energy, when the cost of hydrogen and atomic energy as alternative 
energy sources has come into parity with the cost of natural gas. 
 Potential energy mix (by 2050): 55% hydrogen, 25% electricity 
imports, 10% solar, 10% nuclear
Following the exercise, YTL PowerSeraya decided, on the climate 
front, to pursue opportunities from SSP1-1.9 where the world is 
committed to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 and achieve 
net zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, YTL PowerSeraya’s 
Sustainability Committee will enhance risk management to mitigate 
climate-related risks from SSP2-4.5 (current scenario based on the 
combined pledges and implementation of the Paris Agreement) 
and SSP5-8.5 (worst-case scenario with up to 4.7°C warming by 
the end of the century). 
On the energy transition front, is envisaged that Singapore’s energy 
mix will be significantly different from today’s mix of 95% natural 
gas and 5% fuel oil. By 2050, it will likely comprise electricity 
imports, hydrogen-fired generated power, solar energy and other 
alternative energy solutions. YTL PowerSeraya is aligning its energy 
transition with Singapore’s developments in alternative energy 
infrastructure and pursuing the growth opportunities that will arise 
with an interconnecting power system across Southeast Asia. 
Meanwhile, Wessex Water’s climate-related risk assessment is informed 
by UK Climate Projections (UKCP18), the UK Climate Risk Assessment, 
the findings of the IPCC and the National Adaptation Plan. 
The table and chart below summarise UKCP18 projections (between 
the low emissions RCP2.6 pathway and the high emissions RCP8.5 
pathway) for changes to average rainfall and summer temperature in 
Wessex Water’s operating region, relative to a 1961-90 reference period. 
Time Period 2030-59 2050-79 2070-99
50th Percentile Probability
Summer Precipitation (Jun-Aug) -15% to -19% -19% to -30% -21% to -39%
Winter Precipitation (Dec-Feb) +9% to +11% +11% to +18% +12% to +26%
Summer Average Daily Temperature +1.9 to +2.2°C +2.1 to +3.6°C +2.3 to +5.4°C
Least Likely, More Extreme Outcomes
Summer Precipitation (Jun-Aug) -36% to -43% -43% to -60% -46% to -71%
Winter Precipitation (Dec-Feb) +24% to +28% +28% to +39% +29% to +54%
Each of these futures is dependent on the development of three 
key global trends, namely geopolitical cooperation, technological 
advancement in low-carbon solutions and digitalisation of distributed 
energy resources such as solar photovoltaic systems, energy storage 
systems and electric vehicles. Depending on how the global trends 
pan out, the blueprint postulated three different scenarios on how 
Singapore will steer its power sector toward net zero by 2050.

It is clear that across all scenarios and timescales, average 
summers will become drier and warmer, and average winters will 
be milder and wetter. 
Overlying these trends, during short-term time horizons, Wessex 
Water expects a lot of variation from one year to the next. 
Moreover, the resilience of Wessex Water’s services is affected 
more by extreme weather events – such as heatwaves, droughts, 
intense storm events and prolonged rainfall – than by changes to 
averages. As background warming takes place, weather events 
previously considered extreme or unusual are likely to occur more 
frequently. This is the most critical issue for Wessex Water’s 
resilience and adaptability. 
Climate-related risks will affect the reliability and quality of the 
services provided to customers and communities, and place 
greater stress on the water environment. This in turn will likely 
lead to greater pressure on Wessex Water’s activities. 
Further information can be found in YTL PowerSeraya’s 
Sustainability Report 2023  and Wessex Water’s Climate Change 
Adaptation Report in the ‘ ESG’ section on our website.
GHG Emissions
We measure and report our GHG emissions to develop a coherent 
climate strategy centered on various nature-based solutions as 
well as community-based adaptation plans and initiatives in our 
various business units.
Our investment strategy has expanded to encompass new 
business models and green technology that focuses on energy 
efficiency, digitisation, resource recovery and cleaner energy 
solutions for a low carbon and climate resilient transition.
Type Description
Scope 1 Direct emissions from the consumption of fossil 
fuels and refrigerant in our operations as well as 
company-owned or operated vehicles, equipment 
or on-site facilities within our business operations
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from purchased energy consumption
Scope 3 Other indirect emissions from our value chain, such 
as employee commuting and business travel for 
subsidiaries that have collected data; outsourced 
activities, purchased electricity and fuels (extraction, 
production, transmission and distribution), treatment 
chemicals and reuse of biosolids on third party land 
in our water and sewerage operations

This year, we registered total Scope 1 GHG emissions of 4,160 
kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO 2e), a 6.1% increase 
compared to 3,921 ktCO 2e last year. The increase was due mainly 
to higher power generation in Singapore, which rose 6.0% for the 
financial year under review to 10,644 GWh. Meanwhile, Scope 2 
emissions rose slightly to 153 ktCO 2e from 150 ktC0 2e last year.
As a result, GHG intensity for the year under review, based on 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions measured against revenue, was 
unchanged from the previous year at 0.19.

Emission factors used for calculation of GHG emissions above are 
sourced from the IPCC, Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB), 
Malaysia’s Energy Commission, Singapore’s Energy Market 
Authority (EMA) and National Environment Agency (NEA) and the 
UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA). 
In the UK, Wessex Water’s gross GHG emissions approximated 
those of the previous year. A combination of energy efficiency 
improvements, renewable energy generation and the rapidly 
falling carbon dioxide intensity of UK grid electricity has led to 
steadily falling emissions over the last eight years. 
Power Generation Mix
In Singapore, we continue to seek low carbon energy options in 
order to deliver affordable electricity to customers. At present, 
substantially all the power generated by YTL PowerSeraya comes 
from natural gas. 
In January 2024, YTL PowerSeraya won the first request-for-
proposal under the EMA’s new Centralised Process framework to 
develop a 600 MW hydrogen-ready combined cycle gas turbine 
(“CCGT”) power plant at its Pulau Seraya Power Station site. 
The hydrogen-ready CCGT will be at least 30% volume hydrogen-
ready, with the ability to be retrofitted to become operationally 
100% hydrogen-ready in the future, aiding in emissions reduction 
and underscoring our commitment to environmentally sustainable 
practices. 
The project will complement and diversify Singapore’s power mix 
alongside solar, imported electricity and other potential low 
carbon energy sources. The hydrogen-ready CCGT is also set to 
make a substantial impact to support Singapore’s generation 
capacity to meet growing electricity demand. 
This monumental undertaking is pivotal in positioning Singapore 
to achieve the nation’s long-term net zero emissions aspiration by 
2050, under the Singapore Green Plan. 
Energy options in Singapore are currently, by and large, limited to 
fossil-based fuels owing to the country’s geographic characteristics 
and constraints. As a major power sector player in Singapore’s 
open electricity market, YTL PowerSeraya has an important role in 
providing reliable and energy efficient electricity to power the 
country’s economy while contributing to the Singapore 2030 
climate change goals. 
In our pursuit of a sustainable future, the division is actively 
exploring low carbon hydrogen prototyping and conducting 
feasibility studies in collaboration with research institutions and 
key hydrogen partners. Solar energy capabilities at the Group’s 
Pulau Seraya Power Station are also being expanded. These 
efforts aim to improve energy efficiency and promote green 
power generation.

Renewable Energy
In support of the transition to a low carbon economy, YTL Power 
has implemented various renewable energy integration projects 
across our business units and promoted the generation and use of 
renewable energy to facilitate the transition process and minimise 
our environmental footprint.
In line with our shift towards more sustainable renewable energy 
solutions, we are developing a solar power facility with a 
generation capacity of up to 500 MW in Johor, Malaysia.
This year, Wessex Water generated 17 GWh of renewable energy 
and exported 9 million cubic metres of biomethane to the gas grid, 
double the volume of natural gas it consumed itself. 
On 23 October 2023, YTL PowerSeraya announced that it would 
invest more than S$5 million to expand the amount of solar power 
generated at its Pulau Seraya Power Station to 5 MWp, up from 
the existing 1 MWp. The increased capacity, which can produce a 
monthly average of 417 MWh under optimal conditions, will 
support more than 1,000 four-room Housing Board flats monthly.
In continuation of its eco journey with Power Eco Add-on – 
Singapore’s First-And-Only customisable green add-on (Renewable 
Energy Certificate or Carbon Credits) for an electricity plan – 
Geneco celebrated its sixth Anniversary this year by offering 
complimentary first 6 months of the innovative green add-on to 
both new and existing Geneco residential customers who opt-in or 
upgrade to Power Eco Add-on. As of 30 June 2024, Geneco had 
3,711 customers who have opted for Power Eco Add-on, with an 
increase of 303 customers compared to last year, contributing to 
an overall target of 6,800 customers by 2030.
Green Financing
The Wessex Group’s Sustainable Financing Framework, which 
supports its financing ambitions to deliver tangible environmental 
and social benefits, was originally published in September 2022 
and has recently been refreshed to incorporate latest practices. 
The framework aligns Wessex Water’s purpose – to support customers’ 
health and well-being and enhance the environment and the diverse 
communities it serves – and its business plan commitments to its 
financing ambitions through targeted financing. Under the framework, 
environmental or social debt instruments may be issued to support 
environmental and social objectives, enabling investors to participate 
in the provision of a sustainable future.
The Wessex Group launched an inaugural £300 million sustainability 
bond in March 2023. The borrowings were used to refinance eligible

WATER EFFICIENCY 
Across our operations, our sources of water withdrawal consist of 
municipal water supply, NEWater (reclaimed water in Singapore) 
and seawater. We use water in our power plants for cooling 
processes and equipment. Our offices and other businesses use 
water for drinking, cleaning, landscaping and other general purposes. 
All trade effluent from our operations is treated and discharged to 
water courses or sewer systems in accordance with the 
environmental discharge limits and effluent standards in countries 
where we operate.
(in ML) 2024 2023 2022
Water withdrawal* 127,073 130,175 127,515

Water consumption 2,580 2,875 2,702
Note:
*  Comprises surface water, groundwater, seawater and third-party water
The marginal increase in water discharge was due to higher 
rainfall in England, which has led to more water being treated and 
discharged in our water and sewerage business.
In Singapore, our sustainability efforts also extend to optimising water 
efficiency within our operations. We are exploring innovative methods 
to reduce water usage and improve water recycling processes, 
contributing to overall resource conservation and sustainability.
Sustainable Abstraction 
As a low-lying water-stressed nation, Singapore is especially 
susceptible to rising water costs. To address this, YTL PowerSeraya 
plans to reuse up to 70% of the rejected water from its 
Demineralisation Water Treatment Plant and boost the overall 
water recycling rate by more than 50% from its 2020 level by 
2030.
Meanwhile, in the UK, Wessex Water was 98% compliant for its 
regulatory year with the licences that control how much water the 
business can take from the environment.
Peak temperatures in 2023 occurred in the middle of June, with a 
corresponding spike in demand. However, the rest of the summer 
saw a return to wetter conditions and Wessex Water comfortably 
maintained supplies to all customers, avoided any usage 
restrictions and provided flow support to several vulnerable 
streams and rivers. 
None of the population Wessex Water serves was at risk of severe 
restrictions, consistent with targets. While unplanned supply 
interruptions grew to 1.53% in during the 2024 regulatory year, 
compared to 0.76% the previous year, it remained well within the 
2.34% target.
On leakages, Wessex Water made a significant recovery from 
2022, with both dry ground during the drought and a winter 
freeze-thaw event. In 2023, the annual average level of leakage 
reduced by 1.4 Ml/d. This result was achieved by pressure 
management and leakage control improvements, which included 
installing over 6,000 permanent acoustic loggers in the network 
to aid leak detection.
Following consultation with the public and DEFRA, Wessex Water 
published an ambitious revised draft Water Resources Management 
Plan in spring 2024. The plan targets cutting demand sufficiently 
to reduce abstraction from the environment by 20% by 2037-38 
in the most vulnerable catchments, including the Hampshire Avon. 
Wessex Water intends to use a combination of water efficiency 
visits, smart metering and strategies to stem leakage. Wessex 
Water also proposes to invest in a number of new supply side 
schemes and is collaborating with neighbouring water companies 
to develop strategic regional water resource options. 
Further details on the draft  Water Resources Management Plan 
can be found in the ‘ ESG’ section on our website.

Energy Efficiency
We manage and monitor our energy consumption and efficiency to implement the appropriate energy management practices in our daily 
operations. We have implemented several initiatives to reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and progressively upgrade our 
existing infrastructure with energy saving features across YTL Power’s operations and properties.

Notes:
^  This is a first-time disclosure for the current financial year under review
1  Defined as total fuel and energy consumed less total energy sold
The increase in fuel consumption was mainly due to the higher 
power generation by YTL PowerSeraya.
In the UK, Wessex Water’s electricity use, at 268 gigawatt hours, 
was relatively high in the context of the last five years, in part due 
to the very wet weather experienced from July onwards. Wessex 
Water continues to pursue energy efficiency opportunities to offset 
any rising energy use driven by tighter water and sewage treatment 
standards and the operation of the regional water supply grid. 
In Singapore, YTL PowerSeraya continues to actively pursue ways 
to improve the energy efficiency of power plants, including plans 
to upgrade existing gas turbine blades to allow for high-
temperature firing and to install more variable speed drives in feed 
water pumps to reduce energy consumption. 
Besides embarking on upstream low carbon energy solutions, YTL 
PowerSeraya is committed to supporting carbon abatement 
initiatives and providing low carbon electricity to end-users in 
Singapore. 
Another aspect of our sustainable future is the human factor, 
where operator productivity is optimised through digitalisation 
initiatives. Performance dashboards that provide real-time data and 
insights on plant operations have been deployed, enabling faster 
and better decision-making. Notably, YTL PowerSeraya is in the 
process of equipping operators with drones for enhanced inspection 
of plant assets, reducing the need for manual and risky access. 
These technologies not only improve efficiency and reliability but 
also enhance the safety and well-being of our workforce. 
YTL PowerSeraya continues to emphasise the importance of 
maintaining high standards in quality, environmental, energy, 
health and safety, as well as cyber security management systems. 
The division attained certification in ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO27001, 
ISO45001, BizSafe Star and SS 651 as well as audit compliance 
with the ISO50001 standard under the NEA Energy Management

Environmental Water Quality
All effluent from our operations is treated and discharged to water 
courses or sewer systems is in accordance with the environmental 
discharge limits and effluent standards in countries where we 
operate. We have consistently achieved very high compliance with 
water discharge quality under local standards and there were no 
significant chemical or oil spills during the reporting period.
Water discharge compliance from Wessex Water’s water treatment 
and water recycling centres remained very high at 99%. This was 
below the 100% target with three sites failing in the year, and 
process improvements have been implemented to restore and 
maintain compliance at the specific sites.
Exceptional rainfall, with 2023 being one of the wettest on record 
for the region, resulted in a significant increase in storm overflow 
discharges, as well as more sewer flooding and minor pollution 
incidents. Despite this, Wessex Water is encouraged by the 
reduction in serious pollution numbers to just one reported in the 
year and is pleased to have received a four-star rating on 
environmental performance, the highest rating possible.
Storm overflows are the legacy of over 100 years, when sewerage 
systems were built using the same pipe to carry both sewage and 
rainwater, with overflows designed to protect property from 
flooding during very heavy rain. Wessex Water has 1,300 overflows 
on 35,089 kilometres of sewers and has been steadily eliminating 
or improving these. 
Wessex Water is installing storage tanks, upgrading sewage 
treatment to increase capacity at 42 water recycling centres and 
introducing more nature-based and low carbon treatment 
methods. Increased investigation and monitoring of overflows in 
the region, as well as an extensive programme of sewer relining to 
help keep wastewater within the system and prevent infiltration 
of groundwater that can lead to flooding, is also continuing. 
In total, nearly 100 improvement projects relating to the discharge 
of untreated water are being completed in the region between 
2020 and 2025, part of a £3 million a month investment to reduce 
the number of hours storm overflows operate by around 25%. 
Additionally, in common with other English water companies, 
every storm overflow on the Wessex Water network is now 
monitored – a world-leading position for the English water 
industry – and Wessex Water uses AI to survey the sewerage 
network. These technologies are providing better visibility, data 
and alerts which will enable faster responses, allow for 
preventative action and guide capital investment choices. 
Further details on the Storm Overflows Improvement Plan  and 
Pollution Incident Reduction Plan 2023-2024  can be found in the 
‘ESG’ section on our website.
In our operations in Singapore, at YTL PowerSeraya’s Pulau Seraya 
and Taser power stations, wastewater after undergoing power 
plant processes is discharged to the open sea. This wastewater 
discharge, which is within the environmental limits regulated 
under the Environmental Protection and Management (Trade 
Effluent) Regulations of Singapore, is about 25.4% of the total 
water withdrawn.

Waste Management 
We continue to work towards efficient resource use and 
responsible disposal in our organisation, focusing on ways to avoid 
unnecessary consumption and waste generation, exploring 
innovative opportunities and partnerships. We engage licensed 
third-party contractors across our operations to handle waste, 
storage and responsible disposal, adhering to best practices and 
local regulatory requirements. 
2024 2023 2022
Total waste generated 
(tonnes) 225,901 159,407 148,921
–  Waste diverted from 
disposal 97% 96% 97%
–  Waste directed to 
disposal 3% 4% 3%
The largest contributor to the higher waste generated this year 
was increased construction works in Wessex Water’s operations 
related to the delivery of the capital expenditure plans under the 
current 5-year business plan, as well as an increase in biosolids 
produced due to a change in treatment method and first-time 
inclusion of a liquid organic waste stream.
In 2023, Wessex Water maintained its performance on disposal of 
sludge to land with 100% compliance. However, the availability of 
the landbank is expected to reduce over the coming years due to 
changes in environmental regulations and other pressures. As part 
of the long-term delivery strategy, Wessex Water is exploring 
alternative sludge destinations.
This year also saw the completion of Wessex Water’s refill point 
programme – providing free drinking water for people on the go 
– with the installation of the 24th and final refill unit in Chippenham 
High Street. In partnership with local councils, Wessex Water 
maintains and promotes these refill points, saving around 350,000 
500ml single-use plastic bottles every year.
Wessex Water also promoted the ‘refill not landfill’ message at 
events throughout the year, providing water stations and refill 
points at two Bath half marathons, the Corsham 10K and Cancer 
Research UK’s Race for Life. These initiatives eliminated the 
equivalent of 52,800 single-use plastic bottles from landfill, 
engaged with more than 3,400 customers and supported over 
27,600 runners and attendees.
In Singapore, as part of ongoing efforts to enhance the waste 
management process, YTL PowerSeraya will be reviewing its 
waste streams, with priority placed on reducing sources of waste 
with higher environmental impact. The review will involve 
monitoring of this waste and exploring solutions to minimise 
waste generation.
Responsible Production & Consumption  
We place a high priority on responsible production and community-
wide initiatives to encourage and assist our customers and their 
local communities in protecting their shared environment and 
resources.
Wessex Water exceeded its performance commitment target for 
the volume of water saved through water efficiency activities, 
delivering savings of 4.9 Ml/d compared to an end of year target 
of 4.0 Ml/d.
This year’s demand management strategy focused on the delivery 
of household (known as Home Check) and non-household visits as 
they deliver high confidence savings. Wessex Water visited 4,127 
household customers offering advice and water efficient products, 
and plumbers returned to 794 of these to fix toilets and taps. The 
team also visited 121 non-household customers (primarily schools).
Alongside this, Wessex Water continued to run summer campaign 
messages and distributed 3,000 free water saving packs and 
5,500 water butts. Nearly 6,500 households signed up to use the 
online GetWaterFit water use calculator and Wessex Water 
engaged with over 9,000 school children on water efficiency. 
There was also a slightly higher number of people opting to move 
on to a meter; customers remain motivated to save money and be 
in control of their utility bills. 
Meanwhile, in Singapore, as at 30 June 2024, Geneco had 3,711 
customers who had opted for its Power Eco Add-on plan, with an 
increase of 303 customers in during the year, contributing to an 
overall target of 6,800 customers by 2030.

BIODIVERSITY 
Based on our Group’s operational footprint, protection of 
biodiversity is of material importance in Wessex Water’s operational 
sphere, which covers over 10,000 square kilometres in the south 
west of England, and our Brabazon development in Bristol, whilst 
our activities in Malaysia and Singapore do not have significant 
impacts on biodiversity.
Wessex Water’s operating region includes:
✓ Over 470 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI)
✓ 35 Special Areas of Conservation
✓ 11 Special Protection Areas
✓ 27 National Nature Reserves
✓ More than 6,200 Local Wildlife Sites or Regionally Important 
Geological Sites
✓ Eight areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (covering over 30% 
of the region) and two National Parks 
This year, Wessex Water delivered 82% of actions, against a 
target of 80% agreed with Natural England, to improve a number 
of SSSIs in its landholdings. This was a significant increase on last 
year’s 67% of actions. 
Of Wessex Water’s SSSI landholding, 63% is in favourable condition 
and 26% is classified as unfavourable – recovering; a total of 
89%. Actions agreed with Natural England to address the 
condition of this SSSI are programmed for 2024-25.
Wessex Water also has a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) partners 
programme which provides funding to projects carried out by 
wildlife organisations that conserve and enhance biodiversity 
across the region. The programme has led to some notable 
conservation successes and has helped to contribute to the goal 
of conserving and enhancing local wildlife. 
Wessex Water’s Biodiversity Action Plan (Spring 2023 Update) can 
be found in the ‘ESG’ section of our website, together with more 
information on current biodiversity partnerships. 
In our property development project in the UK, Brabazon Park, a 
15-acre public park is strategically designed to be at the center of 
our Brabazon development in Bristol. Wildlife corridors are 
designed into our Masterplan, providing protected passage and 
contributing to the biodiversity net gain. These corridors are 
intertwined with Brabazon Park, a new landmark in the south 
west of England at the heart of the development.
The wildlife corridors are intertwined with Brabazon Park, the 
design of which takes inspiration from aviation engineering, 
aiming to capture the historical, cultural and ecological uniqueness 
of the former airfield. One of the highlights of the new green 
space will be the Heritage Trail, connecting the Brabazon Hangars 
with Aerospace Bristol Museum and retelling the history of the 
airfields pioneering past.
Brabazon Park will also support the environment, offering new 
habitats for birds, insects and animals, while also connecting to other 
local wildlife corridors. There will be flowers and grasses, mature 
trees and shrubs, as well as a 3-acre lake, which will be a home for 
aquatic planting and will support sustainable drainage across the new 
neighbourhood. The lake is part of the Masterplan’s water attenuation 
strategy which replaces the need to construct holding tanks.

CUSTOMERS
Our commitment
Providing reliable, affordable services for our customers and 
communities
Our approach
✓ Providing all customers with excellent standards of service that 
protect health, improve the environment and give customers 
good value for money
✓ Building trust and loyalty to maintain long-term relationships and

Customer Satisfaction
Singapore’s open electricity market makes it easy for customers 
to choose their electricity provider, which incentivises electricity 
retailers to come up with attractive, innovative plans that address 
the needs of their customers. Rising awareness of the need to 
address climate change and the unique geographic and resource-
related challenges Singapore faces have increased customer interest 
in more energy efficient solutions that would enable them to 
mitigate their carbon impacts.
This year, Geneco, YTL PowerSeraya’s retail brand, solidified its 
market presence, remaining Singapore’s No.1 Residential Electricity 
Retailer with more than 170,000 customers, an improvement of 
about 6% over last year. Geneco achieved a record milestone at 
the 12th edition of the Loyalty Engagement Awards 2024 and 
won 12 awards – 2 Gold, 6 Silver and 4 Bronze for its brand 
campaigns at the regional event, recognising companies in Asia 
Pacific for its customer loyalty and engagement campaigns.
Meanwhile, in the UK, Wessex Water again delivered very strong 
performance in the water sector’s customer satisfaction metric 
(C-MeX) coming first of the water and sewerage companies and 
second overall. While only 67% of customers rated the service as 
good or very good value for money in 2023 – down from 79% last 
year and below the target of 83% – 87% said they were satisfied 
with the service, unchanged from 2022. Meanwhile, Wessex Water’s 
average Trustpilot rating was 4.6 stars out of 5, and 83% of 
reviewers gave the top possible rating of five stars. Wessex Water 
also underwent full reaccreditation for the highly prised accolade 
held since 1996, the Customer Service Excellence award, with 
improved scores achieved.
Additionally, Wessex Water reported improvements across all relevant 
drinking water quality metrics in 2023 from an already high base 
and expect to be industry-leading among water and sewerage 
companies on the Compliance Risk Index, which is one of two 
measures used by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) to measure 
drinking water quality compliance. The other measure used by the 
DWI is the Event Risk Index (ERI). The provisional ERI score of 24 
is a considerable improvement on last year’s score of 403 – although 
even then Wessex Water outperformed the industry average. 
In Malaysia, YTL Comms continued to build on the roll-out of its 
5G services in tandem with the expansion of Digital Nasional 
Berhad’s network. We have long led the way in democratising 
access to high-speed mobile broadband services, offering the most 
affordable plans and bridging the access divide across rural and 
urban areas of the Peninsula.

Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances
We offer financial assistance and other support programmes across 
our operations intended to assist customers facing difficult or 
challenging circumstances. As part of the YTL Group, YTL Power 
also contributes significantly to YTL Foundation, the YTL Group’s 
charitable arm, responsible for delivering the YTL Group’s community 
improvement initiatives. 
The cost of living in the UK remained high during the year under 
review and many of customers continued to experience economic 
hardship. Wessex Water responded by making support packages 
for vulnerable customers and those struggling to pay their bills 
more visible and easier to access. Actions taken included:
✓ Auto-enrolled just under 5,000 customers to schemes via data 
shares with councils and the Department for Work and Pensions 
✓ Continued to fast-track customers to the Assist scheme (which 
provides bill discounts) at first point of contact 
✓ Introduced a new care leavers scheme pilot, enabling those 
leaving care to automatically access Assist up to the age of 21 
✓ Promoted schemes using a variety of communication channels, 
using imagery and wording customers have said will best 
encourage them to get in touch. Activities included: placing 
advertisements in specialist publications well as in more general 
publications and locations; distributing leaflets through schools; 
and posting on social media
✓ Committed to working with debt advice organisation Money 
Wellness to refer customers to them directly through a web 
portal. With consent, Wessex Water is also able to receive data 
back to support customers to access the right help for them 
✓ Provided 20+ training and awareness-raising sessions with 
partners about what tap, a tailored assistance programme, has 
to offer 
✓ Launched a new online eligibility calculator to enable customers 
to find the right affordability scheme for them
Furthermore, Wessex Water’s strategy to help vulnerable customers, 
Every Customer Matters, continues to guide its work on providing 
inclusive services, including Priority Services. Mirroring the focus 
on fast and easy access to financial help, the division also focused 
on raising awareness and take-up of the support offered, to those 
in other types of vulnerable circumstances. This year, Wessex 
Water has once again retained the British Standard for Inclusive 
Service Provision.

Training, Development & Well-being
Nurturing and building people capabilities continued to be a top 
people agenda in FY2024. Our success is deeply rooted in the 
strength of our people, and investing in them is the key to achieving 
our collective goals. 
In order to equip our employees with the right skills, we provide 
training, workshops and seminars on a diverse range of topics, 
including occupational health and safety, environmental management, 
environmental awareness, project management, technical capability 
and soft skill development such as communications, leadership and 
other topics.

With the acceleration of virtual learning over the past few years, 
it is easier than ever for employees to initiate and undertake their 
own training, signing up for and participating in sessions that best 
suit their specific needs and interests. 
Whilst this method of training is highly effective, tracking these 
training hours is largely done via voluntary reporting by employees 
and, as such, the total training hours captured by conventional 
systems may not accurately reflect the higher number of actual 
training hours undertaken. This is an area for ongoing analysis and 
improvement in the data collection process.
We strive to create an environment where people are engaged 
and view employee feedback mechanisms across our Group as 
essential in creating effective communication channels. During the 
year under review, these included the YTL Group Leadership 
Conference, in addition to a range of programmes carried out at 
subsidiary level across our Group.
YTL PowerSeraya intensified its talent acquisition efforts to 
attract a diverse pool of fresh and skilled professionals in 
engineering and operations, meeting workforce renewal needs 
within the organisation. With a strong commitment to building a 
workforce primarily comprising local Singaporean talent, the 
division partnered with local universities and polytechnics to offer 
38 internships and participated in the Singapore Industry

learning through career fairs and talks has raised awareness of 
career opportunities in the power industry, helping to attract 
young talent to join YTL PowerSeraya upon graduation and 
ensuring a steady pipeline of future employees.
Enhancing the capabilities of employees continued to be a key 
focus as the division invested in their development to build 
organisational capability for operational excellence. Comprehensive 
training programs – including technical, safety, digital skills, soft 
skills and leadership development – led to an increase in training 
hours per employee, averaging 5 training days and 13 training 
sessions per employee. 
This progress was made possible through the adoption of e-learning 
platforms, which provided mandatory training such as Cybersecurity 
Awareness, as well as self-paced, on-demand programs like the 
Digital Learning Suite. Notably, 93% of technicians and technical 
officers utilised the Group’s FROG e-learning platform for digital 
skills training in Microsoft Office Suite.
In recognition of the dedication of employees who have 
contributed to YTL PowerSeraya’s growth over the years, 44 
employees were honoured with Long Service Awards, ranging 
from 5 to 45 years. Continued partnership and engagement with 
employees to gather feedback and identify areas for workplace 
improvement have been key to YTL PowerSeraya’s strong 
employee retention. In the latest Employee Opinion Survey, the 
employee net promoter score improved by 23%, reflecting the 
trust and support of employees in making YTL PowerSeraya a 
better workplace for all.
In the UK, Wessex Water took on 31 graduates (up from 13 in 
2022) and 61 apprentices (up from 48) – with apprenticeships 
now also available to existing members of staff (27 enrolled). 
Wessex Water also hosted 49 work experience placements and 31 
industrial placements (up from 13). 
Additionally, YTL Wessex Academy, which launched in 2022, had 
its initial Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and 
Skills (Ofsted) monitoring visit. Ofsted reported that Wessex Water 
has made “reasonable progress” so far in setting up and delivering 
the five courses being run. 
Wessex Water also introduced new “Skills Bootcamps” for existing 
staff; 64 people completed three camps covering computer aided 
design, better information management and change management. 
Labour Standards
We are committed to a strong code of conduct, professionalism 
and ethical integrity in all of our business dealings and operations. 
We ensure that the rights of our workforce are upheld and 
protected in accordance with the Employment Act 1955 in Malaysia 
and local regulations and labour laws in all jurisdictions where we 
operate. 
We adhere to the YTL Group Code of Conduct & Business Ethics 
which encompasses child/forced labour prevention, non-
discrimination, freedom of expression, employment rights and 
business ethics and compliance. The code can be found in the 
‘ESG’ section of our website.
As at 30 June 2024, about 83% of our workforce was based 
outside Malaysia, in countries that also have sound labour protection 
laws and standards to which we conscientiously adhere. These 
include the UK, Singapore, Indonesia and the Netherlands.
We strongly oppose slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains 
and in any part of our business. To be trusted to do the right thing is 
one of our core values and we would never knowingly engage with 
suppliers or contractors involved in slavery or human trafficking. 
Based on the nature of our operations and the stringency of our 
regulatory compliance requirements, we do not believe any of our 
business units are at risk of child labour or forced labour practices. 
YTL PowerSeraya received four Tripartite Standards recognitions 
for its practices in Recruitment, Flexible Work Arrangements, 
Employment of Term Contract Employees and Age-Friendly 
Workplace Practices. This initiative, led by the Tripartite Alliance 
for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, identifies and 
honours employers with progressive employment practices and 
standards. These recognitions reflect our unwavering commitment 
to fostering a fair, inclusive and dynamic work environment for all 
employees.
YTL PowerSeraya prides itself on enjoying a harmonious and 
collaborative relationship with its industry union, the Union of 
Power and Gas Employees (UPAGE) and has actively partnered 
with UPAGE over the years in programmes such as education 
grants for members’ children and health screening for its 
employees. In 2022, YTL PowerSeraya once again renewed its 
three-year collective agreement with the union following a 
successful negotiation.

and compliance, quarterly health talks and mandatory HSE e-learning 
modules have been implemented. To date, 70% of employees have 
also completed CPR/AED training, equipping them with the 
knowledge and skills necessary to respond effectively in life-
threatening situations, thereby enhancing overall workplace safety. 
To foster a culture of resilience and adaptability in a rapidly 
changing business environment, all non-executive employees were 
provided with Self Leadership and Growth Mindset learning 
opportunities. This empowered them to embrace challenges, take 
initiatives, learn from feedback and continuously develop their skills.
YTL PowerSeraya also embarked on Operation and Technology 
Roadmapping (OTR) in collaboration with the National Trades 
Union Congress. This initiative involved a thorough review of the 
power generation division’s end-to-end work processes to identify 
areas for operational and technological improvements, guiding the 
development of its transformation roadmap. Additionally, the 
division collaborated with the Singapore Institute of Power and 
Gas (SIPG), the EMA and Singapore’s power generation companies 
(Gencos) to centralise and standardise workforce training for 
power plant operations.
This partnership led to the launch of Singapore’s first Centralised 
Power Plant Simulator (CPPS) by SIPG. Six courses, spanning basic to 
advanced levels, were co-developed by SIPG and Gencos, establishing 
a consistent standard for skills training in areas such as power plant 
operations, process controls, and management of equipment alarms 
and malfunctions. The training is conducted in a controlled 
environment, separate from daily plant operations, ensuring the 
safety of participants and the reliability of plant systems.
Accidents and near misses are investigated and findings are 
discussed during management meetings. Any incident of non-
compliance with safety standards and accidents involving 
employees and/or subcontractors is also reported to management 
promptly. Lessons learned from incidents and near misses are 
shared with other business units to prevent a recurrence.

During the year, Wessex Water appointed a process safety 
director and additional process safety engineers to support major 
hazard sites and to further develop the process management 
systems. Wessex Water also continued to provide high levels of 
training and to ensure staff are competent in all aspects necessary 
to keep the facilities operating safely and efficiently. 
The division made progress during the year to actively encourage 
safety-related reporting and transparency. Safety observations 
increased by 44% compared to last year and employee engagement 
increased by 19%. The increasingly mature culture of engagement 
is showing tangible benefits; with 65% fewer lost days related to 
lost time incidents in the year, reflecting both a smaller number of 
incidents and reduced severity when incidents occurred. 
Additionally, Wessex Water broadened how it used Engage, a 
dedicated health and safety reporting platform, to also capture 
human influences relating to behaviours as part of root cause 
analysis investigations and “Make It Right” reviews.  
Wessex Water has developed enhanced safety performance 
reports, provided better support for Occupational Health & Safety 
(OHS) professionals through training, recruitment and role revisions, 
developed a new mandatory induction module and launched health 
and safety campaigns targeting leading OHS issues. 
Over the past year, 3,273 safety audits were completed, an 8% 
increase compared to last year. Amongst other activities, Wessex 
Water revised an OHS framework mechanism for health and safety 
strategic meetings to improve engagement, support and intervention 
as well as adapted OHS practices in line with business restructures. 
Wessex Water is very proud to have retained both its ISO45001

of grades and pay ranges within each grade. We are confident our 
approach on pay is based on merit and job proficiency, and is not 
influenced by factors such as gender, age, religion, ethnicity or 
disability. 
Current areas of focus across our operating divisions include: 
✓ reflecting the diversity of the communities we serve; 
✓ inspiring the next generation to join our various operations by 
engaging with schools and colleges and via targeted activities 
with a range of community groups; and
✓ internships, apprenticeships, graduates and early careers 
initiatives to bolster our young talent recruitment
In Singapore, YTL PowerSeraya adopts fair employment practices, 
complies with Singapore’s labour regulations, endorses Singapore’s 
Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices 
and is a signatory of the Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment 
Practices. YTL PowerSeraya takes guidance from Tripartite 
Standards on employment contracts, flexible work arrangements, 
recruitment practices and age-friendly workplace practices.  
It is the Group’s firm belief that hiring from local communities 
enhances its ability to understand local needs and strengthens its 
capability to serve the local community. YTL PowerSeraya, for 
example, grooms local talents to assume management positions 
within the company. As of 30 June 2024, more than 90% of the 
total workforce are local hires and more than 90% of the senior 
management team are Singaporean. 
YTL PowerSeraya also supports re-employment beyond the 
statutory retirement age of 63. Eligible employees are offered 
post-retirement opportunities, in line with Singapore’s Tripartite 
Guidelines on the re-employment of older employees.
In our UK operations, this year, in addition to the existing Race at 
Work group and Disability Working Group – both of which have 
developed action plans being implemented – Wessex Water worked 
on supporting neurodiverse employees and attracting neurodiverse 
talent, as well as focusing on social mobility for the first time. 
Wessex Water also hosted a successful Culture, Inclusion and 
Diversity (CID) Week in September 2023; provided CID awareness 
training to 659 colleagues; changed job adverts to improve 
inclusivity and accessibility; and continued with its programme of 
executive level sponsorship for each of the main characteristics to 
demonstrate leadership commitment to improving diversity and 
inclusion. Looking ahead, the CID Working Group will review the 
CID awareness sessions and update the content, including social 
mobility topics.

Building Resilient Communities 
As we adapt to evolving socio-economic conditions, it is now more 
important than ever to serve and create positive value for local 
communities. We continue to prioritise our commitment to building 
resilient communities and to improve the livelihoods and socio-
economic well-being of local communities. 
In the UK, approval was obtained this year for the revised Brabazon 
masterplan, further details of which can be found in the Investment 
Holding Activities section of the Management Discussion & Analysis 
in this Annual Report. The revised masterplan is designed to meet 
the needs of local people while also delivering on the objectives 
of the UK’s National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and South 
Gloucestershire Council’s Local Plan. The overarching objective of 
the NPPF is to ensure development is economically, socially and 
environmentally sustainable. 
As the birthplace of Concorde, the former Filton Airfield was known 
for the collective spirit of a community that changed the world. 
Brabazon is being designed to live up to that legacy, creating a 
new neighbourhood to inspire the next generation. Economically, 
the revised masterplan for Brabazon is forecasted to create over 
£5.0 billion in added economic value, with sufficient commercial 
space to support over 30,000 jobs. Socially, it represents a huge 
investment in the community that built Concorde, with three new 
schools, a health centre, community facilities and over 35 hectares 
of new public green spaces, including the largest new urban park 
in the South West for 50 years.
Hangar 16U, the new local social hub, represents the second major 
community investment at Brabazon and is currently under 
construction.  Upon completion, not only will it serve the residents 
of the first phase but establish roots to a wider community. The 
Group is in its second year of a multi-year partnership with Southern 
Brooks to fund community development work and foster social 
cohesion across South Gloucestershire and North Bristol.
Southern Brooks is a community anchor charity, building connections 
and providing support to help individuals and communities thrive 
in South Gloucestershire. This partnership will fund an extra 
community development worker and a range of activities for 
residents and community groups. Crucially, the partnership – worth 
almost £50,000 over an initial two-year period – is designed to 
engage existing local communities as well as new residents at 
Brabazon.

Highlights for FY2024
YTL Foundation Scholarship Programme 
The foundation of the Scholarship Programme is the belief that 
future generations hold the key to a prosperous and progressive 
nation. Two scholarship programmes are available for qualifying 
high achievers who also possess strong interests in community 
service. 
In 2024, YTL Foundation received a record-breaking 2,621 
applications, with 29 scholars selected. 
KelasKita
KelasKita aims to empower every Malaysian to teach anytime and 
anywhere, addressing the learning loss experienced by school-age 
children from the B40 community.
✓ Divisions of the YTL Group nominated 20 volunteers for the 
YTL Foundation’s KelasKita programme who spent 3 months 
(April-June) actively engaged in online tutoring sessions and 
positively impacting the lives of Malaysian students. Through 
interactive tutoring sessions, engaging educational games and 
activities, these 20 volunteers successfully created a supportive 
and conducive learning environment for the students in need. 
✓ PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) stepped forward as an educational 
implementer of the KelasKita programme from June to November 
2023, with 85 dedicated volunteers contributing an impressive 
6,013 volunteering hours and reaching nearly 60 students 
across three different care homes located in Selangor and the 
Klang Valley. 
✓ Teach For Malaysia received a grant from Yayasan Hasnah to 
carry out the KelasKita classes for students in PPR Seri Selangor 
Pudu and Lembah Subang. Volunteers from Universiti Teknologi 
MARA were recruited and trained, kicking off the first session 
with 78 volunteers and 213 students. 
✓ Micron Technology, an American producer of computer memory 
and computer data storage with a large facility in Penang, 
served as an education implementer of the KelasKita programme 
from June to October 2023, and continued once the school 
term started this year, playing a crucial role in providing academic 
support and fostering a positive learning environment for 
students at SJK(T) Ladang Batu Kawan, Penang. 
Looking ahead, Good Shepherd Services in Sabah and Ajar Society, 
focusing on a community they are supporting in Hulu Selangor, 
will soon be starting the KelasKita programme. 
Under the programme, Southern Brooks:
✓ Runs neighbourhood events, from welcome workshops and 
community meetings to drop-in sessions and pop-ups
✓ Provides targeted funding for local groups, helping anything 
from book clubs to gardening groups and parenting networks 
with everyday expenses
✓ Manages newsletters and social media channels to communicate 
community information
✓ Identifies and supports potential community champions
✓ Uses the Royal Society for Public Health Community Spirit 
Framework to measure the success and help target support 
where it is needed most
The division continues to launch new pathways into employment 
for local young people. This involved working with Bristol Talent 
Partnership to hold taster sessions about careers in property, a 
work experience programme for 16-year olds and university 
placement opportunities for students.
Enriching Communities through Education
Education enables upward socio-economic mobility, is key to creating 
a better society and has long been a priority for our Group. YTL 
Foundation believes that education moulds minds, inspires 
achievements, unleashes potential and is the basis on which every 
society progresses. The Foundation works towards unlocking 
opportunities for young Malaysians to grow, develop and reach 
their full potential. 
YTL Foundation champions 21st century learning, organises talks 
and conferences, provides funds for educational and community 
programmes and invests in developing moral leaders of character. 
In its dedication to the principle that all Malaysians deserve high 
quality, equitable education and leaders with strong values and 
character, the Foundation’s resources and expertise are channelled 
into a focused set of initiatives to ensure measurable and meaningful 
impact.

Teach For Malaysia, Micron Technology, PwC and the YTL Group 
remain committed to the programme and will continue their 
volunteering efforts into 2024. YTL Foundation remains steadfast 
in its mission to onboard more organisations to take up the online 
tutoring programme, closing the learning gap and make a lasting 
impact on students in communities across the country.
Leaps Academy
Leaps Academy is dedicated to empowering underserved children 
from the B40 and refugee by providing access to high quality, 
holistic education. Its mission is centered on enhancing academic 
performance, fostering strong character development and 
nurturing meaningful community relationships, thereby building a 
stronger foundation for success. 
The engagement within the YTL Group through providing 
education on sustainability practices since 2023 has significantly 
bolstered collaboration and deepened commitment to such 
practices by the students. 
The restart of in-person Creative Learning and IT Centre (CLiC) 
programmes at UTC Sentul in April 2024 reconnected Leaps 
Academy with the Sentul community after a hiatus of 4 years 
necessitated by the pandemic. 
As of June 2024, there were 370 students joining online and 
physical classes on a weekly basis. Apart from academic subjects, 
our enrichment programmes focused on a diverse range of skills, 
including soft skills development, creative learning, student 
empowerment, financial literacy, computer skills, and awareness 
of social and current issues. 
More than 40 Orang Asli students from SEMOA Home, a non-
governmental organisation in Kampung Tras, Pahang, have adapted 
very well to the Leaps Academy online programmes which started 
in March 2023. All 10 SPM students passed their Bahasa Melayu 
exams, while 8 out of 10 passed their English exams. Tiatira, the 
Orang Asli coordinator at SEMOA Home, reported a noticeable 
improvement in students’ confidence and communication skills 
following their participation in the online classes. 
For the year, Leaps Academy has worked with over 78 volunteers 
including a number of international volunteer students. Several 
dedicated YTL Group staff members who began tutoring at the 
end of 2022 are continuing their impactful journey this year. The 
partnership with Soroptimist International Damansara under their 
Building Bridges Beyond Borders programme has successfully 
recruited 7 volunteer students from top UK universities and 
positively impacted 9 schools with more than 250 students ages 
8 to 22.   
Other programmes carried out during the year included:
✓ Leaps Holiday Programme  – two sessions of “Empowering 
Students to Improve the World”  were conducted, with a total 
of 68 students taking part 
✓ Digital Literacy – conducted by a UTAR lecturer, this programme 
was held for 116 children from local and refugee communities 
with 3 sessions focused on online safety and effective web 
navigation skills
✓ YTL Sustainability Programme at 54C  – conducted by the 
YTL Group Sustainability team for a group of 74 refugee 
students with sessions covering food waste, Earth Hour and 
water conservation
✓ 54C Holiday Programme – children of YTL Group employees 
participated in a full-day programme in March 2023 led by 2 
YTL Foundation scholars, international volunteers and UTAR 
lecturers involving stories and crafts, speech and drama sessions 
and Chinese New Year-themed music and calligraphy activities
✓ Mental Health Programme by IMU  – 19 volunteer students 
from IMU University conducted a session on mental health and 
emotional resilience for 42 students from 3 refugee schools, 
focusing on helping the students regulate their emotions 
through interactive activities, with a key highlight being the 
creation of affirmation cards
✓ CLiC Holiday Programme  – 53 children from the Sentul 
community joined this programme in May 2023 involving a 
music workshop exploring new rhythms and body movements. 
The students also took part in a science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) workshop led by 8 UTAR lecturers
✓ 54C Christmas Party  – 6 Christmas parties were organised: 
1 each for children of YTL Group staff and children from the 
Orang Asli community, and 4 for children from refugee learning 
centers. 95 Christmas lunch boxes were also distributed to two 
additional learning centers
PEMIMPIN GSL Leadership Programme for Schools
PEMIMPIN GSL is a not-for-profit organisation that focuses on 
strengthening leadership in schools across Malaysia. PEMIMPIN 
GSL provides continuous professional development to school 
leaders and middle leaders with the necessary knowledge, skills 
and mindsets to improve student outcomes.

Earlier this year, PEMIMPIN GSL also launched the first ever 
teacher development application called LADAP Plus that has 
garnered more than 20,000 downloads.
As of June 2024, PEMIMPIN GSL successfully impacted over 15,769 
school leaders and teachers from 8,791 schools across Malaysia. 
Through the school leaders and teachers, it has indirectly impacted 
1,680,184 students.
Over the period from August 2023 to June 2024, Pemimpin GSL 
ran four programmes:- Accelerated School Leaders Initiative (ASLI) 
Cohort 1 & 2, Leadership, Enrichment and Development Programme 
Cohort 3 & 4, Leadership and Development Application and the 
Malaysia Teacher Prize. 
Malaysia Teacher Prize – Pemimpin GSL 
The Malaysia Teacher Prize aims to highlight outstanding teachers 
in Malaysia, by acknowledging the impact of their practices on 
their students and the community.
Together with the Global Teacher Prize and PEMIMPIN GSL, YTL 
Foundation co-funded the second year of the Malaysia Teacher 
Prize in 2023. The event saw leaders from public, private and 
social sectors coming together to celebrate the teaching 
profession. 
In November 2023, Cikgu Muhammad Nazmi was announced as 
the 2023 Malaysia Teacher Prize winner during the Summit and 
Award Ceremony. His triumph concluded a rigorous selection 
process that saw five finalists shortlisted out of a whopping 2,135 
applications nationwide. As the winner, Cikgu Nazmi was awarded 
a RM50,000 cash prize. The other four finalists received a RM5,000 
cash prize each.
Themed ‘From the Classrooms to the World Stage’ , the 2-day 
Malaysia Teacher Prize 2023 Summit put front and centre the 
power of teachers and the potential they possess, with an emphasis 
on how their dedication and efforts in the classroom can eventually 
contribute to extraordinary achievements on the global stage.
In a passing of the torch moment, 2022 Malaysia Teacher Prize 
winner Cikgu Anuthra Sirisena was also present to recount her 
ongoing journey after winning the inaugural Prize as both a 
teacher and a community builder at SMJK Chung Hwa, Tenom.
PEMIMPIN GSL runs multiple leadership training programmes for 
school leaders and educators. Those who have completed the 
programme, as well as the Malaysia Teacher Prize winners, 
become part of PEMIMPIN GSL’s alumni community, and are given 
opportunities to attend webinars and masterclasses featuring 
education experts nationwide. They can also showcase their best 
practices and achievements via the alumni community channels. 
Some have also shared their best practices in national media 
platforms, as seen with the Malaysia Teacher Prize 2022 and 
2023 finalists. 
Malaysia Acumen Academy
Malaysia Acumen Academy seeks to build solutions to poverty and 
equip determined individuals using the knowledge and tools of 
business grounded in community and the practices of moral 
leadership. 
As of June 2024, Malaysia Acumen Academy has supported the 
journey of 58 leaders across 7 states who are working to solve 
problems of poverty or social justice in Malaysia. This year, the 
Fellowship expanded its reach to Southeast Asia. 19 leaders from 
Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia were 
selected to join the first cohort of the Southeast Acumen 
Fellowship, which brings a total number of 77 Fellows across the 
region into the programme who have impacted approximately 14.9 
million lives through their leadership.
Teachers for Educational Equity Initiative 
The Teachers for Educational Equity Initiative, co-developed by 
YTL Foundation and the University of Birmingham, aims to provide 
educators with an opportunity to enhance their pedagogical skills 
to reach their full potential and achieve educational equity in 
Malaysia.  
Between April and June 2024, YTL Foundation and the University 
of Birmingham travelled across Klang Valley and to Perak and 
Sarawak, to observe the 66 teachers in their classrooms. Each 
observation session lasted an hour followed by a 20 to 30-minute 
feedback session where the observers shared their critical 
feedback and the teacher reflected on their teaching.

Following 11 months of intense teacher education, the first cohort 
of the Postgraduate Certificate in International Education (PGCEi) 
(Malaysia), comprising 66 of 68 teachers from 11 alternative 
learning centres and 15 high-needs national schools across 
Malaysia, completed their studies at the end of June 2024. To 
ensure the effectiveness of the programme, the Foundation 
conducted a second Monitoring & Evaluation survey in April 2024. 
These teachers were invited for a Celebration Ceremony in 
August, to commemorate their achievements.  
Following visits to new alternative learning centres in Penang in 
January 2024 and a Townhall Infosession in May 2024, 41 teachers 
from 14 alternative learning centres and 19 Teach For Malaysia 
Fellows were nominated for the second cohort of the PGCEi 
(Malaysia).
In June 2024, these 60 teachers sat for the Admission Assessment 
conducted by the University’s Birmingham International Academy 
team. The Assessment is an IELTS-equivalent English language 
assessment for multilingual speakers, designed to ensure that the 
nominees who successfully enrol into the programme are set up 
for success.  
The Foundation and University also opened the online application 
for the MA in Education in June 2024. The programme is available 
for teachers who successfully complete the PGCEi (Malaysia) and 
demonstrate a clear passion to contribute to achieving educational 
equity in Malaysia. The application closed on 5 July 2024, with a 
total of 18 applications. The team is currently reviewing the 
applications and is expected to select a maximum of 15 teachers 
to participate in the first cohort of the MA Education.

Supporting our Communities
We strive to build a resilient society by supporting vulnerable 
groups and giving back to local communities through charitable 
causes, partnerships and volunteerism which we believe can 
leverage our competencies to help those in our communities.
(i) YTL Foundation 
Ruang Kita 
In 2020, YTL Foundation collaborated with Sentul Raya Sdn 
Bhd, Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur, Polis Diraja Malaysia 
and Toy Libraries Malaysia (TLM) to launch the Ruang Kita 
programme in PPR Sri Perak, Sentul. The programme aims to 
provide educational and recreational resources for the local 
community and has garnered significant engagement, including 
Community Day events in December 2022 and May 2023, 
which saw participation from over 1,200 families.
However, post pandemic, there has been a gradual decline 
in the usage of the TLM facilities at PPR Sri Perak, in 2023, 
as the children are busy with school activities. 
Owing to this, YTL Foundation decided to relocate the TLM 
space to the UTC Sentul’s library which is located across the 
road from PPR Sri Perak as UTC Sentul has higher foot traffic 
especially during the weekends. YTL Foundation hopes that 
this move will benefit a larger demographic and provide 
continued support for the Sentul community. 
Sponsorship for the Study UK Alumni Awards
Each year, British Council Malaysia sets out to discover and 
honour outstanding alumni from UK universities who have 
emerged as leaders in their respective fields. These alumni, 
whether entrepreneurs, professionals, or social leaders have 
utilised their UK university experience to make substantial 
contributions to their communities, professions and countries. 
The most exceptional alumni are invited to participate in the 
prestigious ‘Study UK Alumni Awards’  which encompasses 4 
categories: ‘Science & Sustainability’, ‘Culture and Creativity’, 
‘Social Action’ and ‘Business and Innovation’ . The Foundation 
proudly sponsored the ‘Social Action’ category which specifically 
acknowledges alumni who have exhibited exceptional 
commitment to creating positive social change and improving 
the lives of others.

Collaboration with Deloitte on their KidsEdu Programme 
Last year, the Foundation impacted over 300 students through 
a collaboration on the Deloitte KidsEdu Programme. This year, 
YTL Foundation once again collaborated with Deloitte to equip 
children in Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Selangor and Penang 
with YES 5G Sim Cards for online tuition classes. This initiative 
impacted over 300 more students.
State of Gender Inclusion in Asia-Pacific’s Regulatory 
Landscape
It is estimated that it will take approximately 300 years for 
Asia-Pacific to end child marriage, 286 years to close gender 
gaps and remove discriminatory laws and 140 years for women 
to achieve equal representation in the workplace and positions 
of power. These staggering statistics were highlighted in a 
study conducted by Economist Impact supported by AVPN, 
YTL Foundation and RPG Foundation on the state of gender 
inclusion in Asia-Pacific's regulatory landscape.
An event titled ‘From Policy to Action: Assessing Gender 
Inclusion in Asia Pacific’ co-hosted by AVPN and YTL Foundation 
at the Asia Business School on International Women’s Day 
discussed the findings in the report with the aim of galvanising 
action to address the gaps in policy in the region.
(ii) Wessex Group
The charitable Wessex Water Foundation, set up in 2020, 
continued to provide much-needed financial support to social 
and environmental initiatives, in partnership with the Somerset, 
Wiltshire, Dorset and Quartet Community Foundations. 
In 2023-24, grants totalling £567,898 were distributed through 
the Foundation to support core debt advice services provided 
by Citizens Advice and five key environmental partner 
programmes, as well as through two community funding rounds 
supporting grassroots environmental and community activities.
Water Force, Wessex Water’s staff volunteering programme, 
really thrived this year – 760 colleagues, 30% of the whole 
workforce, took part, donating 4,000 hours of work to 33 
different organisations. 
Meanwhile, the Sustainability Working Group for Turnbull 
Infrastructure & Utilities Limited (“Turnbull”), a subsidiary of 
the Wessex Group, organised local community volunteering 
days for employees. This year’s events included local beach 
cleaning events to promote sustainable resource management 
and volunteering at a local wildlife reserve promoting protection 
of biodiversity. 
The beach cleans were tied to National Environmental 
Awareness Day campaigns and the events were used as an 
opportunity for employees to educate the public and raise 
awareness of global sustainability issues such as plastic litter 
pollution. Since the commencement of beach clean-up 
volunteering events in June 2023, with a total of four events 
held so far, over 200 kg of litter has been collected.
Turnbull is a subsidiary of the Wessex Group providing 
sustainable, end-to-end solutions for large scale engineering 
projects. These include supporting the installation and operation 
of utilities for Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear power station 
project in the UK for 20 years.
(iii) YTL PowerSeraya’s Community Outreach Programmes
As one of the largest power generation companies in Singapore, 
YTL PowerSeraya aims to support local communities and 
vulnerable groups, with a focus on environmental stewardship. 
YTL PowerSeraya strives to advocate community-based 
environmental initiatives that encourage and inspire local 
communities to work together to protect their shared 
environment and improve their livelihoods.
Lion Befrienders
YTL PowerSeraya collaborated with Lion Befrienders to bring 
elderly individuals to visit the Gardens By The Bay, in 
commemoration of the International Day of Biodiversity. 30 
dedicated YTL PowerSeraya volunteers accompanied 45 
seniors (including seven wheelchair users), providing information 
on the plants and trees found around the Flower Dome and 
Cloud Forest, cultivating a deeper appreciation and sense of 
protection for plants. The volunteers went above and beyond, 
taking personal responsibility for the seniors’ well-being and 
ensuring their safety and enjoyment throughout the visit.

Lion Befrienders is a non-governmental organisation that acts 
as a second home for seniors to participate in engaging 
activities within the community. It is also one of the 
organisations under the care of the National Council of Social 
Service, which YTL PowerSeraya has always supported through 
outright donations.
‘The Human Element’ Documentary Screening
As an effort to foster environmental responsibility in the local 
community, YTL PowerSeraya organised an environmental 
movie screening for the public at Singapore Botanic Gardens 
to raise climate awareness. The movie, ‘The Human Element’, 
is an environmental documentary capturing the impact of 
climate change on various communities and ecosystems. YTL 
PowerSeraya proudly presented this multi-award-winning 
movie for the first time in Asia through this exclusive public 
screening.
The movie screening was a collaborative effort between YTL 
PowerSeraya, the National Parks Board (NParks) and the 
Ministry of Sustainability and Environment (MSE), supporting 
the MSE’s GoGreenSG campaign and held in conjunction with 
the NParks Heritage Festival.
The screening was graced by the guest of honour, Senior 
Minister of State for the MSE and the Ministry of Transport 
Singapore, Dr Amy Khor. The screening drew approximately 
1,000 attendees from the public including YTL PowerSeraya’s 
stakeholders, with 32 employees who volunteered more than 
160 hours in making the event a success.
Salvation Army Donation Drive
YTL PowerSeraya engaged with the Salvation Army to recycle 
used items including clothes, books, toys and shoes. These 
items are thrifted at Salvation Army Family Stores, with all 
the income from the stores going to support the Salvation 
Army’s initiatives to provide holistic care to the community. 
In addition, recycling and reusing items conserves natural 
resources, cuts down on energy consumption and decreases 
waste and pollution associated with manufacturing new goods.
Employees donated good-condition used items, including 
clothes, books, toys and shoes, resulting in the collection of 
an entire Salvation Army bin filled with used items. Due to 
the generous number of items donated, the Salvation Army 
extended the collaboration and officially included the YTL 
PowerSeraya office as one of their donation-in-kind drop-off 
locations. About 275 kg of used items was collected within 
the first 3 months and the numbers are estimated to increase 
as more people donate.
Tree-Planting Campaign
Geneco did a fair share of environmental protection this year, 
continuing with an annual contribution to The OneMillionTrees 
Movement by NParks, in support of Singapore’s Green Plan 
2030. Geneco is committed to planting 250 trees over five 
years and, since 2021, has planted 150 trees. A further 50 
trees were successfully planted in 2024 at the East Coast 
Park with the support of 50 employees including the top 
management.

unethical behaviour throughout the organisation and in dealings 
with business partners
✓ Maintaining sound risk management systems and internal controls 
to ensure significant risks are identified and properly managed 
✓ Fostering a culture of ethics and integrity to ensure compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements
Our Board is the gatekeeper for our Group’s values, culture and 
ethics. Standards of governance and behaviour are communicated 
through policies that cover areas including ethics and anti-bribery 
and corruption, and training on these issues is provided to 
employees. Sound ethics, integrity and a strong compliance 
culture are at the heart of our operations, driving environmental, 
social and governance policy commitments at the highest level 
through to business practices on the ground.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our Group has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate 
governance and protection of stakeholder value, which has been 
integral to the YTL Power Group’s achievements and strong financial 
profile to date. YTL Power’s corporate governance structure is a 
fundamental part of the Board’s responsibility to protect and

PRACTICES
YTL Power has robust risk management practices and internal 
controls in place which cover financial, operational and compliance 
controls and risk management. Our risk management practices and 
internal controls are a concerted and continuing process, designed 
to manage rather than to eliminate all the risks that may hinder 
the Group from achieving its business objectives, and provide 
reasonable assurance against material misstatement, loss or fraud.
Details can be found in our Statement on Risk Management and 
Internal Control  in this Annual Report.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
YTL Power adheres to the YTL Group’s Code of Conduct & Business 
Ethics, which also sets out the whistleblowing policy and procedures, 
and the YTL Group’s Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”), 
both of which can be found in the ‘Governance’ section of our website.
The ABC Policy outlines the YTL Group’s strategies in identifying, 
preventing and managing bribery and corruption issues and further 
enforces the YTL Group’s Code of Conduct & Business Ethics in 
order to ensure that all employees understand their responsibilities 
in compliance with the YTL Group’s zero tolerance for bribery and 
corruption within the organisation.

This includes implementing training programmes in accordance with 
operational requirements and the applicable regulations in those 
jurisdictions, for example, with higher risk teams (eg. procurement, 
finance, commercial teams, human resources, customer-facing) being 
required to complete anti-bribery training and/or on a high priority 
basis, whilst training for low-risk teams may be carried out on a 
voluntary basis.
In Malaysia, the policies and procedures put in place are guided by 
the Guidelines on Adequate Procedures issued pursuant to Section 
17A(5) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009. 
Employees in Malaysia are required to read and understand the 
ABC Policy and the Code of Conduct & Business Ethics, successfully 
complete the online training modules to reinforce their understanding 
of the policy and sign the YTL Group’s Integrity Pledge in 
acknowledgement of their obligations and responsibilities.
A comprehensive implementation plan has been established to 
communicate and disseminate the ABC Policy throughout YTL 
Power’s Malaysia-based workforce through online training modules 
and other communication methods, and has been a highly effective 
component of the overall anti-bribery and corruption risk management 
process. 91% of employees have completed the full training.
Compliance with the ABC Policy continues to be monitored closely 
on an ongoing basis. The annual risk assessment is carried out to 
identify the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed and 
the appropriateness of the mitigation measures established to 
minimise the exposure to these risks.
Training modules and other methods of communication are employed 
on an ongoing basis to familiarise employees with their duties and 
obligations in this area. Training carried out during the financial 
year under review focused on areas including anti-bribery and 
corruption, as well as a cybersecurity refresher course.

CYBERSECURITY & DATA PROTECTION 
Security and resilience of our digital systems and protection of 
data are of critical importance to our business. We have appropriate 
systems in place to  protect sensitive company information and 
safeguard information of the stakeholders with whom we interact 
and/or transact from misuse, theft and unauthorised access. 
In Malaysia, the YTL Power Group operates under the umbrella of 
the YTL Group Cybersecurity Task Force which was established in 
2022 to safeguard the YTL Group from cyber threats and attacks. 
Under the task force, the YTL Zero Trust Framework (ZTF) was 
established as a guide to implementing effective and efficient 
cybersecurity best practices. 
We strongly believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 
Employee awareness and training are critical components of our 
cybersecurity risk management strategy. A cybersecurity refresher 
course was released during the year under review, covering 
cybersecurity threats such as social phishing scams, as well as, 
prevention strategies. 
The Task Force has also established a centralised channel for 
incident reporting, allowing employees to report on potential 
incidents or seek clarity on the legitimacy of the content that they 
had received. These reporting channels are consistently 
communicated on the intranet to ensure employee accessibility.
The Cybersecurity Task Force maintains a proactive stance by 
continually analysing threat intelligence to identify potential risks 
that could impact the Group. In collaboration with our subsidiaries, 
the Task Force is also actively engaging to assess existing levels 
of maturity and to provide guidance on enhancing cybersecurity 
defence mechanisms. This collaborative approach bolsters the 
overall cybersecurity resilience of our corporate ecosystem.
This year, YTL PowerSeraya established a Cybersecurity Task Force 
and a Steering Committee to oversee and coordinate cyber operations 
and initiatives. The Task Force members regularly report to the 
Steering Committee, with updates on cyber threats, incidents and 
mitigation measures. The Task Force ensures adherence to regulatory 
requirements and best practices in cybersecurity, with the goal of 
improving cyber resilience and readiness, safeguarding business 
interests and reputation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2024
The Board of Directors (“Board”) of YTL Power International Berhad 
(“YTL Power” or “Company”) remains firmly committed to ensuring 
an appropriate and sound system of corporate governance 
throughout the Company and its subsidiaries (“YTL Power Group” 
or “Group”). The YTL Power Group has a long-standing commitment 
to corporate governance and protection of stakeholder value, 
which has been integral to the YTL Power Group’s achievements 
and strong financial profile to date. 
The YTL Power Group’s corporate governance structure is a 
fundamental part of the Board’s responsibility to protect and 
enhance long-term shareholder value and the financial performance 
of the YTL Power Group, whilst taking into account the interests of 
all stakeholders.
In implementing its governance system and ensuring compliance 
with the Main Market Listing Requirements (“Listing Requirements”) 
of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”), the Board 
has been guided by the principles and practices set out in the 
Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“Code”) issued by the 
Securities Commission Malaysia (“SC”).
An overview of the Board’s compliance with the Code during the 
financial year ended 30 June 2024 is detailed in this statement.
The Company’s Corporate Governance Report (“CG Report”) for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2024 is available at the Company’s 
website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com and has been released 
via the website of Bursa Securities at www.bursamalaysia.com in 
conjunction with the Annual Report.
PRINCIPLE A:  
BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS
Responsibilities of the Board
YTL Power is led and managed by an experienced Board with a wide 
and varied range of expertise to address and manage the complexity 
and scale of the YTL Power Group’s operations. This broad spectrum 
of skills and experience ensures the YTL Power Group is under the 
guidance of an accountable and competent Board. The Directors 
recognise the key role they play in charting the strategic direction, 
development and control of the YTL Power Group.
Key elements of the Board’s stewardship responsibilities include:-
• Ensuring that the strategic plans for the YTL Power Group 
support long-term value creation for the benefit of its 
stakeholders and include strategies on economic, environmental 
and social considerations underpinning sustainability; 
• Promoting good corporate governance culture within the YTL 
Power Group which reinforces ethical, prudent and professional 
behaviour;
• Overseeing the conduct of the YTL Power Group’s businesses 
to evaluate and assess management performance to determine 
whether businesses are being properly managed; 
• Ensuring there is a framework of prudent and effective 
internal control and risk management systems which enable 
risks to be identified, assessed and managed;
• Succession planning for the Board and senior management; 
• Overseeing the development and implementation of a 
shareholder/stakeholder communications policy;
• Reviewing the adequacy and integrity of the YTL Power 
Group’s management information and internal control systems; 
and
• Ensuring the integrity of the YTL Power Group’s financial and 
non-financial reporting.
The Board is led by the Executive Chairman who is responsible for 
instilling good corporate governance practices, leadership and 
effectiveness of the Board.
There is a clear balance of power, authority and accountability 
between the Executive Chairman, Tan Sri (Sir) Francis Yeoh Sock 
Ping, and the Managing Director, Dato’ Seri Yeoh Seok Hong, 
between the running of the Board and the Company’s business, 
respectively. The positions of Executive Chairman and Managing 
Director are separate and clearly defined, and are held by different 
members of the Board.
The Executive Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board 
in ensuring the effectiveness of all aspects of its role, and is 
primarily responsible for leading the Board in setting the values 
and standards of the Company, including good corporate 
governance practices, the orderly and effective conduct of the 
meetings of the Board and shareholders, leading discussions, 
encouraging active and open participation, managing the interface 
and encouraging constructive relations between the Board and 
management, ensuring the provision of accurate, timely and clear 
information to Directors and effective communications with 
stakeholders and facilitating the effective contribution of Non-
Executive Directors.
87ANNUAL REPORT 2024
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT

---- Page 90 ----
The Managing Director is responsible for, amongst others, 
overseeing the day-to-day running of the business, developing 
and implementing Board policies and strategies, making operational 
decisions, serving as the conduit between the Board and 
management in ensuring the success of the Company’s governance 
and management functions, ensuring effective communication 
with shareholders and relevant stakeholders, providing strong 
leadership, i.e., effectively communicating the vision, management 
philosophy and business strategy to employees, and keeping the 
Board informed of salient aspects and issues concerning the 
Group’s operations.
The Managing Director and Executive Directors are accountable to 
the Board for the profitability and development of the YTL Power 
Group, consistent with the primary aim of enhancing long-term 
shareholder value. The Independent Non-Executive Directors have 
the experience and business acumen necessary to carry sufficient 
weight in the Board’s decisions and the presence of these 
Independent Non-Executive Directors brings an additional element 
of balance to the Board as they do not participate in the day-to-
day running of the YTL Power Group.
The roles of Executive and Non-Executive Directors are 
differentiated, both having fiduciary duties towards shareholders. 
Executive Directors have a direct responsibility for business 
operations whereas Non-Executive Directors have the necessary 
skill and experience to bring an independent judgment to bear on 
issues of strategy, performance and resources brought before the 
Board. The Executive Directors are collectively accountable for the 
running and management of the YTL Power Group’s operations 
and for ensuring that strategies are fully discussed and examined, 
and take account of the long-term interests of shareholders, 
employees, customers, suppliers and the many communities in 
which the YTL Power Group conducts its business. 
In accordance with the Code, the Executive Chairman is not a 
member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee or 
Remuneration Committee, all of which are chaired by and comprise 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. This promotes objectivity in 
the Board’s deliberations and ensures there are effective checks 
and balances, as well as objective review by the Board of 
recommendations put forth by the committees.
In the discharge of their responsibilities, the Directors have 
established functions which are reserved for the Board and those 
which are delegated to management. Key matters reserved for 
the Board’s approval include overall strategic direction, business 
expansion and restructuring plans, material acquisitions and 
disposals, expenditure over certain limits, issuance of new 
securities, payments of dividends and capital alteration plans. 
Further information on authorisation procedures, authority levels 
and other key processes can also be found in the Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control  set out in this Annual 
Report.
Board Meetings & Procedures
Board meetings are scheduled with due notice in advance at least 5 
times in a year in order to review and approve the annual and 
interim financial results. Additional meetings may also be convened 
on an ad-hoc basis when significant issues arise relating to the YTL 
Power Group and when necessary to review the progress of its 
operating subsidiaries in achieving their strategic goals. Meetings of 
the Board committees are conducted separately from those of the 
main Board to enable objective and independent discussions. The 
Board met 5 times during the financial year ended 30 June 2024.
The Directors are fully apprised of the need to determine and 
disclose potential or actual conflicts of interest which may arise in 
relation to transactions or matters which come before the Board. In 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the Directors 
formally disclose any direct or indirect interests or conflicts of 
interests in such transactions or matters as and when they arise 
and abstain from deliberations and voting at Board meetings as 
required.
The Directors have full and unrestricted access to all information 
pertaining to the YTL Power Group’s business and affairs to enable 
them to discharge their duties. At least one week prior to each 
Board meeting, all Directors receive the agenda together with a 
comprehensive set of Board papers encompassing qualitative and 
quantitative information relevant to the business of the meeting. 
This allows the Directors to obtain further explanations or 
clarifications, where necessary, in order to be properly briefed 
before each meeting.
Board papers are presented in a consistent, concise and 
comprehensive format, and include, where relevant to the proposal 
put forward for the Board’s deliberation, approval or knowledge, 
progress reports on the YTL Power Group’s operations and 
detailed information on corporate proposals, major fund-raising 
exercises and significant acquisitions and disposals. Where 
necessary or prudent, professional advisers may be on hand to 
provide further information and respond directly to Directors’ 
queries. In order to maintain confidentiality, Board papers on 
issues that are deemed to be price-sensitive may be handed out 
to Directors during the Board meeting.

The Board is supported by a professionally qualified and competent 
Company Secretary. The Company Secretary, Ms Ho Say Keng, is a 
Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, a 
registered member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and 
an affiliate member of the Malaysian Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators, and is qualified to act as Company 
Secretary under Section 235(2)(a) of the Companies Act 2016.
The Company Secretary ensures that Board procedures are 
adhered to at all times during meetings and advises the Board on 
matters including corporate governance issues and the Directors’ 
responsibilities in complying with relevant legislation and 
regulations. The Company Secretary works very closely with 
management for timely and appropriate information, which will 
then be passed on to the Directors. In accordance with the Board’s 
procedures, deliberations and conclusions in Board meetings are 
recorded by the Company Secretary, who ensures that accurate 
and proper records of the proceedings of Board meetings and 
resolutions passed are recorded and kept in the statutory register 
at the registered office of the Company.
During the financial year under review, the Company Secretary 
attended training, seminars and regulatory briefings and updates 
relevant for the effective discharge of her duties. The Company 
Secretary carries out ongoing reviews of existing practices in 
comparison with any new measures introduced in the Listing 
Requirements and/or legislation, regulations and codes applicable to 
the governance of the Company and updates the Board accordingly.
Board Charter
The Board’s functions are governed and regulated by the 
Constitution of the Company and the laws, rules and regulations 
governing companies in Malaysia, including the Companies Act 2016 
and the Listing Requirements. The Board has a Board Charter, a 
copy of which can be found under the “ Governance” section on the 
Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com. 
The Board Charter serves several important functions, including as 
a primary reference to the Board of its role, fiduciary duties and 
responsibilities, its governance processes and legal framework 
within which it operates and as an induction tool for new Directors. 
The Board Charter clearly identifies the respective roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, Board committees, Directors and 
management and the issues and decisions reserved for the Board.
The Board Charter was most recently updated and adopted on 21 
August 2024 to set out, amongst others, the applicability to the 
Board of the new Conflict of Interest Policy (detailed below) and 
the Code of Conduct & Business Ethics for the YTL Group of 
Companies (“YTL Group”) and to establish a policy which limits the 
tenure of the Independent Non-Executive Directors to nine years 
without further extension. 
The Board Charter is reviewed as and when changes arise and 
updated in accordance with the needs of the Company and any 
new regulations that impact the discharge of the Board’s 
responsibilities.
Business Conduct, Ethics & Whistleblowing
Following the amendment to the Board Charter on 21 August 
2024, the Directors will observe and adhere to the Code of 
Conduct & Business Ethics going forward, replacing the Code of 
Ethics for Company Directors issued by the Companies Commission 
of Malaysia. 
YTL Power has an established track record for good governance and 
ethical conduct and is also guided by the corporate culture of its 
parent company, YTL Corporation Berhad (“YTL Corp”). Key guidance 
is contained in the Code of Conduct & Business Ethics of the  
YTL Group, which also sets out the whistleblowing policy and 
procedures, and the YTL Group’s Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy,  
as detailed in the following section. A copy of the Code of Conduct  
& Business Ethics can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
The Code of Conduct & Business Ethics sets out the acceptable 
general practices and ethics for the YTL Group and includes 
policies and measures to address conflicts of interest, abuse of 
power, corruption, insider trading, money laundering and data 
protection. On 21 August 2024, the Code of Conduct & Business 
Ethics was updated to codify existing environmental, social and 
governance policies and general practices that apply across the 
YTL Group.
Training modules and other methods of communication are 
employed on an ongoing basis to familiarise employees with their 
duties and obligations in this area. Training carried out during the 
financial year under review focused on areas including anti-bribery 
and corruption, as well as, a cybersecurity refresher course.

Conflicts of Interest (“COI”)
In May 2024, the Board adopted a COI Policy which is intended to 
ensure that any actual or potential COI that a Director or key 
senior management may have is appropriately dealt with or 
managed. The policy applies to the Directors and key senior 
management of the YTL Power Group and sets out guidance in 
identifying COI situations, disclosure and recusal requirements and 
the measures to be taken to resolve, eliminate or mitigate conflicts. 
The policy also expands the scope of the Audit Committee’s 
review of COI situations and the measures taken to resolve, 
eliminate or mitigate any such conflicts.
To assist the Audit Committee in discharging its duties in this 
area, a ‘COI Declaration Form’ has been adopted together with the 
COI Policy for the purpose of identifying, evaluating, disclosure/
reporting, monitoring, maintenance and management of COI 
situations.
Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”)
The objective of the ABC Policy is to further enforce the YTL 
Group’s Code of Conduct & Business Ethics in order to ensure that 
all Directors and employees understand their responsibilities in 
compliance with the YTL Group’s zero tolerance for bribery and 
corruption within the organisation. This is in line with the corporate 
liability provision in Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission Act 2009 (“MACC Act”) which came into force on 1 
June 2020. A copy of the ABC Policy can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
The ABC Policy outlines the YTL Group’s strategies in identifying, 
preventing and managing bribery and corruption issues. The 
policies and procedures put in place are guided by the Guidelines 
on Adequate Procedures issued pursuant to Section 17A(5) of the 
MACC Act. The ABC Policy applies to all Directors, managers and 
employees of the Company in dealing with external parties in the 
commercial context. The policy is reviewed at least once every 
three years and amended as needed to ensure that it continues to 
remain relevant, appropriate and effective to enforce the principles 
highlighted therein and to ensure continued compliance with the 
prevailing law.
A comprehensive implementation plan has been established to 
communicate and disseminate the ABC Policy on an ongoing basis 
throughout the YTL Group through online training modules and other 
communication methods, and has been a highly effective component 
of the overall anti-bribery and corruption risk management process.
Directors and employees of the YTL Group in Malaysia are required 
to read and understand the ABC Policy and the Code of Conduct & 
Business Ethics, successfully complete the online training modules 
to reinforce their understanding of the policy and sign the YTL 
Group’s Integrity Pledge in acknowledgement of their obligations 
and responsibilities. 
Compliance with the ABC Policy continues to be monitored closely 
on an ongoing basis. The annual risk assessment is carried out to 
identify the corruption risks to which the Group is exposed and 
the appropriateness of the mitigation measures established to 
minimise the exposure to these risks.
Sustainability Governance
The YTL Power Group has a long-standing commitment to ensuring 
that its businesses are viable and sustainable on a long-term basis. 
The Board oversees governance of the YTL Power Group’s 
sustainability matters which includes setting its environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) strategies, priorities and targets,

The Directors are kept apprised of the key ESG issues relevant and 
specific to the YTL Power Group through briefings from the ESG 
Committee and management on performance, targets and 
operational updates, and also stay abreast with more general 
developments in the ESG arena through training programmes, 
further details of which are disclosed in the Nominating Committee 
Statement in this Annual Report.
The Board’s evaluation process includes criteria for addressing and 
managing significant risks that may have a considerable impact on 
the Company, and ESG risks are incorporated into this process as 
they form part of the overall risk management framework. Further 
details are set out in the section below on Evaluation of the Board 
and in the Nominating Committee Statement  in this Annual 
Report.
Composition of the Board
The following changes to the composition of the Board took place 
during the financial year under review:
• Encik Faiz Bin Ishak resigned from the Board on 30 November 
2023
• Encik Faizal Sham Bin Abu Mansor was appointed to the Board 
on 6 December 2023
The Board has 12 Directors, comprising 8 executive members and 
4 independent non-executive members. The Independent 
Directors comprise 33.3% of the Board, providing an effective 
check and balance in the functioning of the Board, and in 
compliance with the Listing Requirements, which require one-
third of the Board to be independent.
The Directors are cognisant of the recommendation in the Code 
for the Board to comprise a majority of independent directors, and 
will assess the composition and size of the Board on an ongoing 
basis to ensure the needs of the Company are met.
YTL Power is 54.94%-owned by YTL Corp, which is in turn 
50.09%-owned by Yeoh Tiong Lay & Sons Holdings Sdn Bhd (as 
at 30 June 2024). The Executive Directors are appointed by the 
major shareholder in accordance with its rights under the 
Companies Act 2016 and the Constitution of the Company. 
YTL Power is majority-owned by a single shareholder, unlike other 
listed companies that may have a dispersed shareholder base 
which enables a shareholder to exercise control despite holding a 
minority stake. The interests of the major shareholder are fully 
aligned with those of all shareholders of the Company.
The expertise and experience in both the day-to-day running of 
the Group’s businesses and the determination and setting of its 
broader strategy lies with the Executive Directors in order to 
ensure the ongoing ability to fulfil their roles and responsibilities 
as stewards of the Group’s businesses. 
Nevertheless, the Company has in place appropriate and rigorous 
governance structures and internal controls necessary to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and protect shareholder value. 
There is robust oversight in the form of the Board’s Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominating committees, all of which are 
chaired by and comprise solely Independent Non-Executive 
Directors.
The Board is of the view that the current Independent Non-
Executive Directors have the experience and business acumen 
necessary to carry sufficient weight in the Board’s decisions, and 
act in the best interests of the shareholders. 
None of the Independent Non-Executive Directors have served on 
the Board for a period exceeding the nine-year term limit 
recommended in the Code. 
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution, at least one-third 
of the Directors are required to retire from office at each Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) and may offer themselves for re-election 
by rotation. Directors who are appointed by the Board during the 
financial year are subject to re-election by shareholders at the 
next AGM held following their appointments. 
The names of Directors seeking re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM are disclosed in the Notice of Annual General Meeting  in this 
Annual Report, whilst the review of Directors proposed for re-
election and their profiles can be found in the Nominating 
Committee Statement  and the Profile of the Board of Directors , 
respectively. This information is also available under  
the “ Governance ” section on the Company’s website at  
www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
Board & Senior Management Appointments
The Nominating Committee is responsible for assessing suitable 
candidates for appointment to the Board, with due regard for 
diversity, taking into account the required mix of skills, experience, 
age, gender, ethnicity, time and commitment, background and 
perspective of members of the Board before submitting its 
recommendation to the Board for decision. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2024
91ANNUAL REPORT 2024
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT

---- Page 94 ----
The Nominating Committee is chaired by and comprises solely 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of the 
Nominating Committee is Datuk Seri Long See Wool. This complies 
with the recommendation under the Code that the chairman of 
the Nominating Committee should not be the chairman of the 
Board.
Whilst it has, to date, not been necessary to do so given the 
expertise of the Independent Non-Executive Directors, the Board 
will also endeavour to utilise independent sources including 
external human resources consultants and specialised databases, 
as appropriate.
Meanwhile, members of senior management are selected based 
on relevant industry experience, with due regard for diversity in 
skills, experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and 
perspective, and are appointed by the Executive Chairman and/or 
the Managing Director following recommendation by the Executive 
Director in charge of the relevant division.
As the Board’s overriding aim is to maintain a strong and effective 
Board, it seeks to ensure that all appointments are made on merit, 
taking into account the collective balance of elements such as 
skills, experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and 
perspective.
The Board recognises the importance of encouraging and 
developing female talent at all levels. Currently, there are three 
female directors on the Board comprising 25% of the Board and, 
therefore, whilst the Board has not met the target of 30% 
women directors set out in the Code, it will continue to seek Board 
members of the highest calibre, and with the necessary strength, 
experience and skills to meet the needs of the YTL Power Group.
Evaluation of the Board
Annual evaluation of the Board as a whole, Board committees and 
individual Directors is carried out by the Nominating Committee. 
The evaluation carried out during the financial year under review 
involved an annual assessment of the effectiveness of each 
individual Director, the Board’s committees and the Board as a 
whole with the objectives of assessing whether the Board, its 
committees and the Directors had effectively performed its/their 
roles and fulfilled its/their responsibilities, and devoted sufficient 
time and commitment to the Company’s affairs, in addition to 
recommending areas for improvement.
The assessment exercise was facilitated by the Company Secretary 
and involved the completion of questionnaires/evaluation forms 
comprising a Board and Board Committees Effectiveness Evaluation 
Form, Director’s Performance Evaluation Form, Director’s 
Confirmation of Independence Form, Audit Committee 
Effectiveness Evaluation Form and Audit Committee Members 
Evaluation by Nominating Committee Form.
The results of the annual evaluation carried out form the basis of 
the Nominating Committee’s recommendations to the Board for 
the re-election of Directors. As recommended in the Code, the 
Board will endeavour to utilise independent experts to facilitate 
the evaluation process, as and when appropriate. Further 
information on the activities of the Nominating Committee can be 
found in the Nominating Committee Statement  set out in  
this Annual Report. This information is also available under  
the “ Governance ” section on the Company’s website at  
www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
Remuneration
Directors’ remuneration is decided in line with the objective 
recommended by the Code to determine the remuneration for 
Directors so as to attract, retain, motivate and incentivise Directors 
of the necessary calibre to lead the YTL Power Group successfully. 
In general, the remuneration of the Directors is reviewed against 
the performance of the individual and the YTL Power Group. The 
Executive Directors’ remuneration consists of basic salary, other 
emoluments and other customary benefits as appropriate to a 
senior management member, whilst the Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration comprises Directors’ fees and benefits. The 
component parts of remuneration are structured so as to link 
rewards to performance. Directors do not participate in decisions 
regarding their own remuneration packages. Directors’ fees and 
other benefits must be approved by shareholders at the AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee (“RC”) is chaired by and comprises 
solely Independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with 
the Code.
The RC assists in the implementation of the remuneration policy 
and procedures, including reviewing and recommending matters 
relating to the remuneration of the Directors and senior 
management to the Board. The RC also ensures that the 
remuneration policy and procedures remain appropriate based on 
prevailing practices and aligned with the strategy and values of 
the YTL Power Group.

---- Page 95 ----
The composition of the RC is set out below:-
• Datuk Seri Long See Wool (Chairman)
• Datuk Loo Took Gee
• Tan Sri Ismail Bin Adam ( appointed on 6 December 2023 )
The terms of reference of the RC and Remuneration Policy and 
Procedures for Directors and Senior Management  can be found 
under the “G overnance ” section on the Company’s website at 
www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the RC met once, 
attended by all members. The meeting, which was held on 2 
August 2023, assessed the remuneration of the Directors and 
senior management as well as fees and meeting attendance 
allowance (benefits) proposed for the Independent Non-
Executive Directors (“INED Remuneration”), guided by the 
framework set out in the YTL Power Group Remuneration Policy 
and Procedures for Directors and Senior Management . The 
remuneration of the Directors and the INED Remuneration were 
benchmarked against comparable listed companies in Malaysia in 
terms of industry and size/market capitalisation. The RC also 
considered the performance of the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors as indicated by the evaluations conducted and 
responsibilities assumed by the Directors and senior management, 
as well as the overall performance of the Group. In view of the 
foregoing, the RC considered the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and senior management to be reasonable.
The RC, with the Independent Non-Executive Directors abstaining 
from deliberation and voting in respect of his/her own proposed 
remuneration, recommended to the Board for shareholders’ 
approval that the INED Remuneration remains unchanged as it 
was still competitive and on par with the market rate.
Details of the Directors’ remuneration categorised into appropriate 
components can be found in Note 6 in the Notes to the Financial 
Statements  in this Annual Report. Meanwhile, as regards the 
remuneration of the YTL Power Group’s senior management team, 
the Board is of the view that the disclosure of these details would 
not be in the best interests of the YTL Power Group due to 
confidentiality and the competitive nature of the industries in 
which the YTL Power Group operates, as well as for business and 
personal security reasons.
Board Commitment
In accordance with the Listing Requirements, members of the 
Board do not hold more than five directorships in public listed 
companies. This ensures that their commitment, resources and 
time are focused on the affairs of the YTL Power Group thereby 
enabling them to discharge their duties effectively.
Presently, each Board member is required to assess (via the 
annual assessment process) whether he/she devotes the 
necessary time and energy to fulfilling his/her commitments to 
the Company. The Board recognises that an individual’s capacity 
for work varies depending on various factors that weigh very 
much on his/her own assessment. Hence, having rigid protocols in 
place before any new directorships may be accepted is not 
practical. Each Board member is also expected to inform the Board 
whenever he/she is appointed as an officer of a corporation. In 
accordance with the Board Charter and guidance in the Code, none 
of the Directors are active politicians.
The details of each Director’s attendance of Board meetings can be 
found in the Profile of the Board of Directors  whilst details of the 
training programmes attended during the year under review are 
disclosed in the Nominating Committee Statement  in this Annual 
Report. This information is also available under the “ Governance” 
section on the Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
PRINCIPLE B:  
EFFECTIVE AUDIT & RISK MANAGEMENT
Integrity in Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that financial 
statements are drawn up in accordance with the Listing 
Requirements, Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, 
International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities  made pursuant to Section 248-249 of the 
Companies Act 2016 is set out in this Annual Report.
In presenting the financial statements, the Company has used 
appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates, to present a 
true and fair assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. 
Interim financial reports were reviewed by the Audit Committee 
and approved by the Board prior to release to Bursa Securities.

Audit Committee
The Company has in place an Audit Committee which comprises 
solely Independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with 
the Listing Requirements and the Code, namely Encik Faizal Sham 
Bin Abu Mansor, Datuk Seri Long See Wool and Datuk Loo Took 
Gee. Encik Faizal Sham Bin Abu Mansor was appointed as the

The members of the Audit Committee possess a wide range of 
necessary skills to discharge their duties, and are financially 
literate and able to understand matters under the purview of the 
Audit Committee including the financial reporting process. The 
members of the Audit Committee also intend to continue to 
undertake professional development by attending training to keep 
themselves abreast of relevant developments in accounting and 
auditing standards, practices and rules.
The Audit Committee holds quarterly meetings to review matters 
including the YTL Power Group’s financial reporting, the audit

Company’s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT (“PwC 
Malaysia”). The external auditors also attend each AGM in order to 
address clarifications sought pertaining to the audited financial 
statements by shareholders. 
The Audit Committee’s Auditor Independence Polic y guides its 
assessment of the suitability, objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors. The policy includes, amongst others, a cooling off 
period of three years before a former audit partner of the external 
audit firm may be appointed as a member of the Audit Committee 
and additional assessment criteria based on information presented in 
the Annual Transparency Report  of the external auditors, in line 
with the Code. None of the Audit Committee members were formerly 
partners of YTL Power’s external auditors.

Risk Management & Internal Control
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for maintaining 
a sound system of risk management and internal control to 
safeguard the investment of its shareholders and the YTL Power 
Group’s assets, and that these controls are designed to provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against the risk of 
occurrence of material errors, fraud or losses.

PRINCIPLE C: 
INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING & 
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
STAKEHOLDERS
Communication with Shareholders & Other Stakeholders
The YTL Power Group values dialogue with its stakeholders and 
constantly strives to improve transparency by maintaining 
channels of communication that enable the Board to convey 
information about performance, corporate strategy and other 
matters affecting stakeholders’ interests. The Board believes that 
a constructive and effective investor relationship is essential in 
enhancing stakeholder value and recognises the importance of 
timely dissemination of information to stakeholders. 
The Board ensures that shareholders are kept well-informed of 
any major development of the YTL Power Group. Such information 
is communicated through the Annual Report, the various 
disclosures and announcements to Bursa Securities, including 
quarterly and annual results, and corporate websites. Corporate 
information, annual financial results, governance information, 
business reviews and future plans are disseminated through the 
Annual Report, whilst current corporate developments are 
communicated via the Company’s corporate website at  
www.ytlpowerinternational.com and the YTL Group’s community 
website at www.ytlcommunity.com , in addition to prescribed 
information, including its interim financial results, announcements, 
circulars, prospectuses and notices, which is released through the 
official website of Bursa Securities. 
The Executive Chairman, Managing Director and/or the Executive 
Directors meet with analysts, institutional shareholders and 
investors throughout the year not only to promote the 
dissemination of the YTL Power Group’s financial results but to 
provide updates on strategies and new developments to ensure 
better understanding of the YTL Power Group’s operations and 
activities. Presentations based on permissible disclosures are 
made to explain the YTL Power Group’s performance and major 
development programs. 
Whilst efforts are made to provide as much information as possible 
to its shareholders and stakeholders, the Directors are cognisant of 
the legal and regulatory framework governing the release of 
material and sensitive information so as to not mislead its 
shareholders. Therefore, the information that is price-sensitive or 
that may be regarded as undisclosed material information about the 
YTL Power Group is not disclosed to any party until after the 
prescribed announcement to Bursa Securities has been made.

Conduct of General Meetings
The AGM is the principal forum for dialogue with shareholders. 
The Board provides opportunities for shareholders to raise 
questions pertaining to issues in the Annual Report, corporate 
developments in the YTL Power Group, the resolutions being 
proposed and the business of the YTL Power Group in general at 
every general meeting of the Company. 
The Notice of the AGM and a circular to shareholders in relation to 
the renewal of the Company’s share buy-back and recurrent 
related party transactions mandates, if applicable, are sent to 
shareholders at least 28 days prior to the AGM in accordance with 
the Code, which also meets the criteria of the Listing Requirements 
and Companies Act 2016, which require the Notice of AGM to be 
sent 21 days prior to the AGM. This provides shareholders with 
sufficient time to review the YTL Power Group’s financial and 
operational performance for the financial year and to fully evaluate 
new resolutions being proposed to make informed voting decisions 
at the AGM. 
The Executive Chairman, Managing Director and Executive 
Directors provide appropriate answers in response to shareholders’ 
questions during the meeting, thereby ensuring a high level of 
accountability, transparency and identification with the YTL Power 
Group’s business operations, strategy and goals. 
The Directors are mindful of the recommendation under the Code 
that all directors must attend general meetings and fully appreciate 
the need for their attendance at all such meetings. All Directors 
attended the Company’s 27th AGM held on 5 December 2023.
Extraordinary general meetings are held as and when required to 
seek shareholders’ approval. The Executive Chairman, Managing 
Director and Executive Directors take the opportunity to fully 
explain the rationale for proposals put forth for approval and the 
implications of such proposals for the Company, and to reply to 
shareholders’ questions. 
Where applicable, each item of special business included in the 
notice of the meeting is accompanied by an explanatory statement 
for the proposed resolution to facilitate full understanding and 
evaluation of the issues involved. All resolutions are put to vote by 
electronic poll voting and an independent scrutineer is appointed 
to verify poll results. The results of the electronic poll voting are 
announced in a timely manner, usually within half an hour of the 
voting process to enable sufficient time for the results to be 
tabulated and verified by the independent scrutineer.
The rights of shareholders, including the right to demand a poll, 
are found in the Constitution of the Company. At the 27th AGM of 
the Company, held on 5 December 2023, the resolutions put forth 
for shareholders’ approval were voted on by way of a poll.  
Where general meetings are held on a virtual basis, the Board 
utilises available platforms and technologies that support meaningful 
engagement with shareholders by ensuring smooth broadcast of 
the general meeting and enabling interactive participation by 
shareholders via facilities to submit questions before and during the 
general meeting. Questions posed by shareholders are made visible 
to all meeting participants during the meeting. 
The Company engages professional service providers to manage 
and administer its general meetings who have in place the 
necessary data privacy and protection and cybersecurity policies 
and procedures to safeguard the information of the Company and 
its shareholders. 
Minutes of general meetings are posted on the Company’s 
website under the “ Meetings ” page, which can be accessed

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
for the financial year ended 30 June 2024
The Board of Directors (“Board”) of YTL Power International 
Berhad (“YTL Power” or “Company”) is pleased to present the 
Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control for the 
financial year ended 30 June 2024, issued in compliance with 
Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of 
Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) and 
Principle B of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 
(“Code”), with guidance from the Statement on Risk Management 
and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers 
issued by the Taskforce on Internal Control and endorsed by 
Bursa Securities.
BOARD RESPONSIBILITY
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for maintaining a sound 
system of risk management and internal control which includes 
the establishment of an appropriate control environment 
framework to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the assets 
of YTL Power and its subsidiaries (“YTL  Power Group”). The Board 
reviews the adequacy and integrity of the system of internal 
control which covers not only financial controls but operational 
and compliance controls and risk management. 
Due to inherent limitations in any system of internal control and 
risk management, the Board recognises that such systems are 
designed to manage rather than to eliminate all the risks that may 
hinder the Group from achieving its business objectives, and as 
such, can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement, loss or fraud.
 
The Board believes that the YTL Power Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control, financial or otherwise, in place 
for the financial year under review, should provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the achievement of the objectives of ensuring 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability and 
transparency of financial information and compliance with laws 
and regulations.
PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE YTL POWER GROUP’S 
SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The principal features of the YTL Power Group’s system of 
internal control can be summarised as follows:-
• Authorisation Procedures: The YTL Power Group has a 
clear definition of authorisation procedures and a clear line of 
accountability, with strict authorisation, approval and control 
procedures within the Board and senior management. 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the YTL 
Power Group which set out, among others, authorisation 
levels, segregation of duties and other control procedures to 
promote effective and independent stewardship in the best 
interests of shareholders.
• Authority Levels: The YTL Power Group has delegated 
authority levels for tenders, capital expenditure projects, 
acquisitions and disposals of businesses and other significant 
transactions to the Executive Chairman, Managing Director and 
Executive Directors. The approval of capital and revenue 
proposals including financing of corporate and investment 
funding requirements above certain limits is reserved for 
decision by the Board. Other investment decisions are 
delegated for approval in accordance with authority limits. 
Comprehensive appraisal and monitoring procedures are 
applied to all major investment decisions.
• Financial Performance: Interim financial results are 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board 
upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee before 
release to Bursa Securities. The full year audited financial 
results and analyses of the YTL Power Group’s financial 
performance are disclosed to shareholders. 
• Internal Compliance: The YTL Power Group monitors 
compliance with its internal financial controls through 
management reviews. Financial reports are reviewed by key 
personnel to enable it to gauge achievement of annual targets. 
Updates of internal policies and procedures are undertaken to 
resolve operational deficiencies and to reflect changing risks, 
as well as changes to legal and regulatory compliance 
requirements relevant to the YTL Power Group. Internal audit 
visits are systematically arranged to monitor and scrutinise 
compliance with procedures and assess the integrity of 
financial information provided.
KEY PROCESSES OF THE YTL POWER GROUP’S 
SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The key processes that the Board has established to review the 
adequacy and integrity of the system of internal control are as 
follows:-
• Internal Audit Function and Audit Committee Oversight:

effectiveness of the internal control systems implemented by 
management and reports directly to the Audit Committee. A 
description of the work of the internal audit function can be 
found in the Audit Committee Report , whilst additional details 
about the personnel and resources of YTLIA are contained in 
the Corporate Governance Overview Statement set out in this 
Annual Report. This information is also available under the 
“Governance ” section on the Company’s website at www.
ytlpowerinternational.com.
 YTLIA operates independently of the business or service units 
it audits and reports to the Audit Committee on the results of 
the audits, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
system of internal control and significant risks. The Audit 
Committee reviews and evaluates the key concerns and issues 
raised and ensures that appropriate and prompt remedial 
action is taken by management. 
 There were no material weaknesses or issues identified during 
the review for the financial year that would require disclosure 
in this Annual Report. 
 The companies of the Wessex Water Limited group (“Wessex 
Water”) based in the United Kingdom (“UK”) were not covered 
by the internal audit process discussed above. Wessex Water’s 
operations are subject to stringent financial and operational 
controls imposed by its regulator, the UK Water Services 
Regulation Authority (known as Ofwat), a government body, 
and by its regulatory licence. Wessex Water Services Limited 
(“WWSL”) possesses its own internal audit department. The 
internal audit department reports to WWSL’s audit committee, 
which has the responsibility to ensure the preservation of 
good financial practices and monitor the controls that are in 
place to ensure the integrity of those practices. It reviews the 
annual financial statements and provides a line of 
communication between the board of directors and the 
external auditors. It has formal terms of reference which deal 
with its authorities and duties, and its findings are presented 
to the Audit Committee.  
 Similarly, the companies of the YTL PowerSeraya Pte Limited 
group (“YTL PowerSeraya”) based in Singapore were also not 
covered by YTLIA. YTL PowerSeraya’s operations are subject 
to stringent financial and operational controls imposed by its 
regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA), a statutory 
board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. 
YTL PowerSeraya outsourced its internal audit functions to a 
reputable professional firm which reports to its audit 
committee and its findings are also presented to the Audit 
Committee. YTL PowerSeraya has the responsibility to ensure 
that the internal controls and systems in place are maintained 
to provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and 
reliability of its financial statements. 
 Ranhill Utilities Berhad (“Ranhill”) and its subsidiaries were not 
covered by YTLIA as Ranhill became a subsidiary of the Group 
towards the end of the financial year under review. Ranhill is 
listed on Bursa Securities and, accordingly, has its own board 
audit committee as part of its corporate governance 
frameworks.
 The system of internal control is constantly reviewed, 
enhanced and updated in line with changes in the operating 
environment. The Board is of the view that the current system 
of internal control in place throughout the YTL Power Group is 
effective to safeguard its interests.
• Executive Board and Senior Management Meetings: 
The YTL Power Group conducts regular executive board and 
senior management meetings comprising the Executive 
Chairman, Managing Director and Executive Directors and 
divisional heads and senior managers. These meetings are 
convened to deliberate and decide on urgent matters and to 
identify, review, discuss and resolve significant financial and 
treasury matters and to monitor the financial standing of the 
YTL Power Group. They also serve to ensure that any new 
financial developments and areas of concern are highlighted 
early and can be dealt with promptly. Decisions can then be 
effectively communicated to all relevant staff levels in a timely 
manner. From these meetings, the executive board and 
management are able to identify significant operational and 
financial risks of the business units concerned.
• Site Visits:  The Managing Director and Executive Directors 
undertake site visits to operating units and communicate with 
various levels of staff to gauge first-hand the effectiveness of 
strategies discussed and implemented. This is to ensure that 
management and the Managing Director and Executive 
Directors maintain a transparent and open channel of 
communication for effective operation.

KEY FEATURES & PROCESSES OF THE YTL POWER 
GROUP’S RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
The Board acknowledges that all areas of the YTL Power Group’s 
business activities involve some degree of risk. The YTL Power 
Group is committed to ensuring that these risks are managed in 
order to protect shareholder value. 
The Board assumes overall responsibility for the YTL Power Group’s 
risk management practices. Identifying, evaluating and managing 
significant risks faced by the YTL Power Group is an ongoing 
process which is undertaken by senior management at each level of 
operations. During the financial year under review, the Board’s 
functions within the risk management practices were exercised 
primarily by the Managing Director and Executive Directors through 
their participation in management meetings to ensure the adequacy 
and integrity of the system of internal control. Emphasis is placed 
on reviewing and updating the process for identifying and evaluating 
the significant risks affecting the business, and policies and 
procedures by which these risks are managed. 
The YTL Power Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial 
risks, including market risk (comprising foreign currency exchange 
risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and 
capital risk. The YTL Power Group’s overall financial risk 
management objective is to ensure that the YTL Power Group 
creates value for its shareholders. The YTL Power Group focuses 
on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance. Financial 
risk management is carried out through risk review analysis and 
internal control systems. The Board reviews these risks and 
approves the appropriate control environment practices. Further 
discussion and details on the YTL Power Group’s risk management 
is contained in the Management Discussion & Analysis  in this 
Annual Report.
Management is responsible for creating a risk-aware culture 
within the YTL Power Group and for the identification and 
evaluation of significant risks applicable to their areas of business, 
together with the design and operation of suitable internal 
controls. These risks are assessed on a continual basis and may be 
associated with a variety of internal and external sources including 
control breakdowns, disruption in information systems, 
competition, natural catastrophe and regulatory requirements. 
Changes in the business and the external environment which may 
give rise to significant risks are reported by management to the 
Managing Director/Executive Directors in developing appropriate 
risk mitigation measures.
The Executive Board will pursue its ongoing process of (i) 
identifying, assessing and managing key business, operational and 
financial risks faced by its business units as well as (ii) regularly 
reviewing planned strategies to determine whether risks are 
mitigated and well-managed, and to ensure compliance with the 
guidelines issued by the relevant authorities. This is to ensure the 
YTL Power Group is able to respond effectively to the constantly 
changing business environment in order to protect and enhance 
stakeholders’ interests and shareholder value.
REVIEW BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
As required under Paragraph 15.23 of the Listing Requirements, 
the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT, have reviewed 
this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control. Their 
review was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance 
Practice Guide (“AAPG”) 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of 
Accountants. Based on their review, they have reported to the 
Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes them 
to believe that this Statement is inconsistent with their 
understanding of the process the Board has adopted in reviewing 
the adequacy and integrity of internal control and risk management 
of the YTL Power Group. AAPG 3 does not require the external 
auditors to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the risk management and internal control systems of the YTL 
Power Group.
CONCLUSION
The Board is of the view that the system of risk management and 
internal control being instituted throughout the YTL Power Group 
is sound and effective. The monitoring, review and reporting 
arrangements in place give reasonable assurance that the 
structure and operation of controls are appropriate for the YTL 
Power Group’s operations and that risks are at an acceptable level 
throughout its businesses. The Managing Director is primarily 
responsible for the financial management of YTL Power and has 
provided assurance to the Board that the YTL Power Group’s risk 
management and internal control system is operating adequately 
and effectively. Reviews of all the control procedures will be 
continuously carried out to ensure the ongoing effectiveness and 
adequacy of the system of risk management and internal control, 
so as to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the YTL Power 
Group’s assets.
This statement was approved by the Board on 21 August 2024.

Bin Adam and Faizal Sham Bin Abu Mansor, the NC (save for 
the member who abstained from deliberations in respect of 
his own re-election) was satisfied that they continue to meet

POLICY ON BOARD COMPOSITION
As the Board’s overriding aim is to maintain a strong and effective Board, it seeks to ensure that all appointments are made on merit, 
taking into account the collective balance of elements such as skills, experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and perspective. The 
Board recognises the importance of encouraging and developing female talent at all levels. Currently, three of the Company’s Directors 
are women and make up 25% of the full Board. Although it has not set any specific measurable objectives, the Board intends to continue 
its current approach to diversity in all aspects while at the same time seeking Board members of the highest caliber, and with the 
necessary strength, experience and skills to meet the needs of the Company.
INDUCTION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF DIRECTORS
Upon joining the Board, a newly appointed Director will be given an induction pack containing the Company’s annual report, various 
policies adopted by the Company, terms of references of the Board Committees, Constitution, and schedule of meetings of the Board 
and Board Committees (if the Director is also a Committee member) which will serve as an initial introduction to the YTL Power Group 
as well as an ongoing reference. Visits to the YTL Power Group’s operational sites and meetings with senior management may also be 
arranged where practicable and appropriate.
The Board, through the NC, assesses the training needs of its Directors on an ongoing basis by determining areas that would best 
strengthen their contributions to the Board. 
Besides the findings from the annual performance evaluation of Directors, which provide the NC with useful insights into the training needs 
of the Directors, each Director is requested to identify appropriate training that he/she believes will enhance his/her contribution to the Board.
The Board has taken steps to ensure that its members have access to appropriate continuing education programmes. The Company Secretary 
facilitates the organisation of in-house development programmes and keeps Directors informed of relevant external training programmes.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the following in-house training programmes were organised for the Directors:
• YTL LEAD Conference 2023;
• Cybersecurity Refresher Quiz Module;
• Managing NFR (Non-Financial Risks) as a Driver for Organisational Performance.

STATUTORY INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(a) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful 
debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for 
doubtful debts; and
(b) to ensure that any current assets, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including the values of 
current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which 
the current assets might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(a) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(b) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; 
or
(c) which have arisen which would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of 
the Company misleading or inappropriate.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements of YTL Power International Berhad (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) give a true 
and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2024, and of their financial performance and their 
cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 
30 June 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of 
changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including material accounting policies, as set out on pages 144 to 297.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” 
section of our report. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) 
of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Our audit approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect 
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration 
of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which the Group and the Company operate.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Impairment review of goodwill
Refer to Note 2(d)(ii) – material accounting policies, Note 3(a) 
– critical accounting estimates and judgements, and Note 13(a) 
– intangible assets
The Group recorded goodwill of RM9,378.1 million as at 30 June 
2024, primarily allocated to the power generation segment in 
Singapore and water and sewerage segment in the United 
Kingdom. Goodwill for these segments represents 95.7% of total 
goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGU”) 
are determined based on value-in-use (“VIU”) calculations. Based 
on the annual impairment test performed, the Directors concluded 
that no impairment is required for goodwill. Key assumptions 
and sensitivities are disclosed in Note 13(a)(i) and 13(a)(ii) to the 
financial statements.
 
We focused on this area as the estimation of the recoverable 
amounts is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement 
on the future cash flows, terminal growth rate and the discount 
rate applied to the projected cash flows. 
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We discussed with management the assumptions underlying the 
approved cash flow projections;
• We evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions used by 
management in the approved cash flow projections by comparing 
the discount rates, revenue growth rates and terminal growth 
rates against publicly available macroeconomic and industry data, 
as well as historical data and market expectations from industry 
reports, where available;
• We were assisted by our valuation experts in assessing the 
assumptions used and the appropriateness of the methodology 
adopted by management for impairment assessments in 
accordance with MFRS 136 “Impairment of Assets”;
• We assessed the reliability of the approved cash flow projections 
by comparing the previous years’ approved cash flow projections 
against past trends of actual results;
• We checked the appropriateness of sensitivity analysis performed 
by management, including disclosures, on reasonable possible 
changes in key assumptions and the corresponding effect on 
the recoverable amounts; and
• We checked appropriateness of disclosures in the financial 
statements. 
Based on procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Capitalisation policy on infrastructure assets of the 
water and sewerage segment in the United Kingdom
Refer to Note 2(b) – material accounting policies, Note 3(b) – 
critical accounting estimates and judgements, and Note 10 – 
property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
As at 30 June 2024, the net book value of infrastructure assets 
of the water and sewerage segment in the United Kingdom was 
RM10,691.8 million. Total cost capitalised during the financial 
year was RM2,529.2 million. These costs comprised capital 
expenditure incurred by the segment to meet the development 
and regulatory requirements of the business, employee and 
overhead costs that are directly attributable to the construction 
of the assets.
There is significant judgement involved in determining whether 
costs incurred, specifically employee and overhead costs meet 
the relevant criteria for capitalisation in accordance with MFRS 
116 “Property, Plant and Equipment” (“MFRS 116”).
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over 
authorisation of selected project’s infrastructure assets and 
identification of capital expenditure attributable to the 
infrastructure assets;
• We understood the nature of costs incurred through discussions 
with management and corroborated cost incurred to supporting 
information provided and checked whether costs incurred met 
the capitalisation criteria in accordance with MFRS 116; 
• We challenged management’s assumptions used in allocating 
certain costs between capital and operating expenditure. 
Specifically, this included assessing the appropriate capitalisation 
of overheads, interest, and infrastructure maintenance costs; 
and
• We sampled capital expenditure costs in the year and agreed 
these costs to underlying support, including timesheets and 
invoices.
Based on procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Expected credit loss assessment on trade receivables 
of the Group’s water and sewerage segment in the United 
Kingdom
Refer to Note 2(m)(iv) – material accounting policies, Note 3(d) 
– critical accounting estimates and judgements and Note 18 – 
receivables, deposits and prepayments
Trade receivables of the water and sewerage segment in the 
United Kingdom of RM613.9 million is net of expected credit 
losses of RM390.4 million as at 30 June 2024.
The Group has estimated the expected credit losses of trade 
receivables on a portfolio basis for the year based on historical 
cash collection trends and economic trends, which are subjective 
in nature.
We focused on this area given the use of significant estimates 
and judgement in determining the appropriate level of expected 
credit losses for trade receivables. 
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of key information 
technology systems used to generate billings and cash collection 
data used for the expected credit loss assessment; 
• We performed substantive testing to ensure the completeness 
and accuracy of reports used to populate the expected credit 
loss provision calculation;
• We obtained historical cash collection trends of each ageing 
bracket of trade receivables and compared them against the 
percentage of expected credit loss used by management against 
each ageing bracket;
• We checked the appropriateness of the forward-looking forecasts 
assumptions used to determine the expected credit losses, which 
included management’s scenario analysis of the impact of 
economic uncertainty due to inflation; 
• We compared the level of expected credit losses against similar 
companies within the industry in the UK; and
• We developed expectations to generate a range for the estimated 
value and compared them against estimates and assumptions 
set forth by management to ensure no management bias over 
expected credit losses.
Based on procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Metered income accrual
Refer to Note 2(m)(ii), Note 2(m)(iii) and Note 2(v)(ii) – material 
accounting policies, Note 3(g) – critical accounting estimates and 
judgements, Note 4 – revenue and Note 18 – receivables, deposits 
and prepayments 
The Group recorded a metered income accrual of RM755.4 million 
as at 30 June 2024 relating to revenue from the provision of 
water services to customers on water meters that had not been 
read at the year-end date. 
Revenue recognition in respect of accrued income is particularly 
judgemental. It arises in relation to unbilled income accrual from 
metered water services. This income accrual requires an estimation 
of the amount of unbilled charges at the period end. It is calculated 
using system generated information based on previous customer 
volume usage. 
Given the range of factors underlying the estimate, there is a 
risk that the metered income accrual and revenue could be 
misstated.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We obtained an understanding of the process for the supply of 
measured services, meter reading and related billing;
• We tested key controls linked to system generated information 
and around the estimation process for measured revenue;
• We compared the accrued income to bills raised post year end 
and compared management’s history of estimating the accrued 
income balance to bills raised in the subsequent year to assess 
the accuracy of accrual income balance;
• We recomputed the accrued income based on customers’ historical 
usage data for selected samples;
• We performed analytical procedures by comparing revenue 
balances for the year against expectation and obtaining support 
for significant variances;
• We corroborated key assumptions and estimates made by 
management in recognising revenue, by obtaining internal and 
external data on factors that influence demand from customers; 
• We performed journal testing over targeted manual entries 
relating to revenue, particularly those recorded close to the year 
end; and
• We obtained an understanding of manual adjustments made to 
accrued income and reviewed the underlying assumptions for 
those adjustments.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment 
of a subsidiary and investment in a subsidiary 
Refer to Note 2(b) and 2(f) – material accounting policies, Note 
3(c) – critical accounting estimates and judgements, Note 10 – 
PPE and Note 14 – investment in subsidiaries 
a) Impairment assessment of PPE
The Group has PPE related to its telecommunications segment 
with an aggregate carrying value of RM1,889.4 million as 
at 30 June 2024.
The Group performed an impairment assessment on the 
carrying value of PPE due to losses recorded by the segment 
which is an impairment indicator.
The impairment assessment was performed by management 
using fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) cash flows 
which requires significant judgement as the timing and 
quantum of these cash flows is dependent on the 
achievement of the next five years’ business plans and 
financial budgets which are dependent on key assumptions 
comprising its growth targets, and sourcing contract 
renewals.
Based on the annual impairment test performed, the 
Directors concluded that no impairment of PPE is required.
a) Impairment assessment of PPE
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We discussed with management the assumptions underlying 
the approved cash flow projections;
• We assessed key assumptions including the discount rate, 
average revenue growth rate, earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) margin, long-term 
growth rate and useful life of the assets by comparing these 
assumptions against publicly available macroeconomic and 
industry data, as well as historical data and market expectations 
from industry reports, where available;
• We were assisted by our valuation expert in assessing the 
assumptions used and the appropriateness of the 
methodology adopted by management for impairment 
assessment in accordance with MFRS 136 “Impairment of 
Assets”;
• We assessed the reliability of the approved cash flow 
projections by comparing the previous years’ approved cash 
flow projections against past trends of actual results; and
• We checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management 
by stress testing the discount rate, average revenue growth 
rate and terminal year EBITDA margin.

b) Impairment assessment on cost of investment in a subsidiary 
in the separate financial statements of the Company
The cost of investment of the telecommunications segment 
of the Group in the separate financial statement of the 
Company as at 30 June 2024 amounted to RM4,553.3 
million. 
Given the impairment indicator as described, the Company 
performed an impairment assessment and estimated the 
recoverable amount based on FVLCD cash flows available 
for distribution and the Directors have concluded that no 
impairment on the cost of investment is required.
We focused on (a) and (b) above as the estimation of the 
recoverable amounts is inherently uncertain and requires 
significant judgement on future cash flows, terminal growth rate 
and the discount rate applied to the calculation of the FVLCD.
b) Impairment assessment on cost of investment in a subsidiary 
in the separate financial statements of the Company
In addition to procedures performed on the approved cash flow 
projection from the underlying PPE of the subsidiary as described, 
we have performed the following audit procedures:
• We assessed key assumptions including the discount rate 
which reflects the specific risk relating to investment in 
the subsidiary and terminal growth rate by comparing these 
assumptions against publicly available macroeconomic and 
industry data, as well as historical data and market 
expectations from industry reports, where available;
• We were assisted by our valuation expert in assessing the 
assumptions used and the appropriateness of the 
methodology adopted by management for impairment 
assessment in accordance with MFRS 136 “Impairment of 
Assets”; and
• We checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management 
on terminal growth rate, discount rate, average revenue 
growth rate and terminal year EBITDA margin.
We checked appropriateness of disclosures for (a) and (b) above in 
the financial statements.
Based on procedures performed, we did not identify any material 
exceptions.

Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Acquisition of Ranhill Utilities Berhad Group
Refer to Note 2(d)(ii) and 2(g)(i) – material accounting policies, 
Note 14(f)(ii) – Investment in subsidiaries
On 28 May 2024, SIPP Power Sdn. Bhd. (“SIPP Power”), an indirect 
70% owned subsidiary of the Group, entered into an unconditional 
share purchase agreement for the acquisition of ordinary shares 
in Ranhill Utilities Berhad (“Ranhill”), representing a 31.42% 
equity interest, for a cash consideration of RM405.2 million. 
As SIPP Power is not a wholly owned subsidiary, the Group’s 
effective interest in Ranhill is 42.9%. Notwithstanding this, the 
Group controls a total of 53.19% voting rights in Ranhill by virtue 
of its control of SIPP Power and therefore, accounts for Ranhill 
as a subsidiary of the Group. 
Based on the requirements of MFRS 3 “Business Combinations”, 
management had assessed the acquisition of Ranhill to be a 
business combination. The fair value of net assets acquired on 
the date of acquisition was assessed via a preliminary purchase 
price allocation (“PPA”) exercise.
We focused on the above as assumptions made in determining 
the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed are inherently uncertain, requires significant judgement 
and are sensitive to change.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We obtained management’s assessment whether the acquisition 
of Ranhill met the definition of a business combination in 
accordance with the requirements of MFRS 3 “Business 
Combination”;
• We assessed the basis for determining the fair values of 
identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition;
• We checked the purchase consideration to a share purchase 
agreement and bank statement for consideration transferred;
• We checked the calculation of goodwill arising from the acquisition 
of Ranhill, being the difference between total purchase 
consideration and fair value of previously held equity interest, 
and the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired; and
• We checked appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements.
Based on procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

on Risk Management and Internal Control, Executive Chairman’s Statement, Managing Director’s Review, Management Discussion & 
Analysis, Environment, Social & Governance Report, Corporate Governance Overview Statement, Audit Committee Report, Nominating

of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.  
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing 
in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s internal 
control. 
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Directors. 
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  (continued)
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. 
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted 
as auditors, are disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in 
Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been used consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the financial statements.
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention (unless 
stated otherwise in the material accounting policies below).
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also 
requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. 
Although these estimates and judgement are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of current events and actions, actual 
results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) Basis of preparation (continued)
 The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (’000) 
except as otherwise indicated. 
(i) Amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable for the Group’s and the Company’s 
financial year beginning on or after 1 July 2023 are as follows:
Effective for 
financial periods 
beginning on
or after
Amendments to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ - Disclosure of Accounting 
Policies 
1 January 2023
Amendments to MFRS 108 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ 
- Definition of Accounting Estimates 
1 January 2023
Amendments to MFRS 112 ‘Income Taxes’ - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities 
arising from a Single Transaction 
1 January 2023
Amendments to MFRS 112 ‘Income Taxes’ - International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules 1 January 2023
The adoption of the above applicable amendments to published standards have not given rise to any material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
(ii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet 
effective
a) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2024
• Amendments to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-
current (effective from 1 January 2024) clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, 
depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the entity’s 
expectations or events after the reporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The 
amendments shall be applied retrospectively.
• Amendments to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (effective 
from 1 January 2024) specify that covenants of loan arrangements which an entity must comply with only after 
the reporting date would not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the reporting date. 
However, those covenants that an entity is required to comply with on or before the reporting date would affect 
classification of a liability as current or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the reporting 
date. The amendments shall be applied retrospectively.
• Amendments to MFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (effective from 1 January 2024) specify 
the measurement of the lease liability arises in a sale and leaseback transaction that satisfies the requirements 
in MFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ to be accounted for as a sale. In accordance with the 
amendments, the seller-lessee shall determine the “lease payments” or “revised lease payments” in a way that 
it does not result in the seller-lessee recognising any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use 
it retains. The amendments shall be applied retrospectively to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after 
the date when the seller-lessee initially applied MFRS 16.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) Basis of preparation (continued)
(ii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet 
effective (continued)
a) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2024 (continued)
• Amendments to MFRS 107 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ and MFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – Supplier 
Finance Arrangements (effective from 1 January 2024) require entities to disclose information that would enable 
users of financial statements to assess how supplier finance arrangements affect an entity’s operations; including 
the effects supplier finance arrangements have on an entity’s liability, cash flows and exposures to liquidity risk. 
The new disclosure requirements would also inform users of financial statements on how an entity might be 
affected if the arrangements were no longer available to it.
b) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2025 
• Amendments to MFRS 121 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’- Lack of Exchangeability (effective 
from 1 January 2025) clarify that entities will be applying a consistent approach in determining if a currency can 
be exchanged into another currency. These amendments provide guidance on the spot exchange rate to use 
when a currency is not exchangeable into another currency and the disclosures entities need to provide to enable 
users of financial statements to understand the impact on the entities’ financial performance, financial position 
and cash flows as a result of a currency being not exchangeable into another currency. An entity does not apply 
the amendments retrospectively. Instead, an entity recognises any effect of initially applying the amendments 
as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings when the entity reports foreign currency transactions. 
When an entity uses a presentation currency other than its functional currency, it recognises the cumulative 
amount of translation differences in equity.
c) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2026
• Amendments to MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and MFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ - Classification 
and Measurement of Financial Instruments (effective from 1 January 2026) clarify the classification and measurement 
requirements in MFRS 9, including the classification of financial assets with environmental, social and corporate 
governance (ESG) and similar features. The amendments clarify how the contractual cash flows on such loans 
should be assessed, specifically the assessment of interest focuses on what a company is being compensated 
for, rather than how much compensation it receives. Nonetheless, the amount of compensation the company 
receives may indicate that it is being compensated for something other than basic lending risks and costs. It also 
clarifies the settlement of liabilities through electronic payment systems. The amendments clarify the date on 
which a financial asset or financial liability is derecognised. In addition, the amendments permit a company to 
derecognise a financial liability before it delivers cash on the settlement date if specified criteria are met. New 
disclosure requirements are also introduced in the amendments to MFRS 7 relating to investments in equity 
instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial instruments with 
contingent features that do not relate directly to basic lending risks and costs.

d) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2027
• MFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’ (effective from 1 January 2027) replaces MFRS 
101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. It retains many requirements from MFRS 101 without modification 
with some of the requirements now moved to MFRS 108 ‘Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements’, including 
the requirement that financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with MFRS Accounting Standards 
shall also make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards. MFRS 18 
aims to enhance financial reporting quality by requiring defined subtotals in the statement of profit or loss, 
disclosures about management-defined performance measures and adding new principles for aggregation and 
disaggregation of information. MFRS 101 shall be withdrawn on the application of MFRS 18.

• Amendments to MFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and MFRS 128 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’ - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture resolve a current 
inconsistency between MFRS 10 and MFRS 128. The accounting treatment depends on whether the non-monetary 
assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a ‘business’. Full gain or loss shall be 
recognised by the investor where the non-monetary assets constitute a ‘business’. If the assets do not meet 
the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised by the investor to the extent of the other investors’ 
interests. The amendments will only apply when an investor sells or contributes assets to its associate or joint 
venture. They are not intended to address accounting for the sale or contribution of assets by an investor in a 
joint operation.
The Group and the Company have started a preliminary assessment on the effects of the above annual improvements 
and amendments to published standards and the impact is still being assessed, except for those have been updated 
above.

(b) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost also includes borrowing costs incurred for assets under 
construction. The cost of certain property, plant and equipment includes the costs of dismantling, removal and restoration, 
the obligation which was incurred as a consequence of installing the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it 
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Where items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to the Group from customers/developers, the fair value of the 
assets transferred is recognised as property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial Position. Where the transfer 
is exchanged for connection to the network and no further obligation is required, the corresponding credit is revenue. Where 
the transfer is linked to the provision of ongoing services, the corresponding entry is deferred income as disclosed in Note 32 
and released to the Income Statement over the expected useful lives of the assets.
Infrastructure assets comprise eight components: impounding reservoirs 150 years, raw water mains 100 years, treated water 
mains 100 years, communication pipes 60 years, sewers 200 years, sewage pumping stations 60 years, combined sewer 
overflows 80 years and sea outfalls 60 years.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each asset to its 
residual value over its estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:
 Years
Buildings 10-80
Plant and machinery 3-30
Equipment, furniture and fittings 3-10
Motor vehicles and aircraft 5-10
Telecommunications equipment 5-30
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication 
exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. A write down is made 
if the carrying amounts exceed the recoverable amounts. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on 
impairment of non-financial assets.
Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Income 
Statement.

(c) Leases
(i) Accounting by lessee
Leases are recognised as ROU asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for 
use by the Group and the Company (i.e. the commencement date).
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group and the Company allocate the consideration in 
the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.
a) Lease term
In determining the lease term, the Group and the Company consider all facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or 
periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended 
(or not to be terminated).
The Group and the Company reassess the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in 
circumstances that is within the control of the Group and the Company and affects whether the Group and the 
Company are reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in the determination of lease term, 
or not to exercise an option previously included in the determination of lease term. A revision in lease term results 
in remeasurement of the lease liabilities. See accounting policy (refer to d) below) on reassessment of lease liabilities.
b) ROU assets
ROU assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:
• The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;
• Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received;
• Any initial direct costs; and
• Decommissioning or restoration costs.
ROU assets that are not investment properties are subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment loss (if any). The ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life 
and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group and the Company are reasonably certain to exercise a 
purchase option, the ROU asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. In addition, the ROU assets 
are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
ROU assets are presented as a separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position.

(c) Leases (continued)
(i) Accounting by lessee (continued)
c) Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The 
lease payments include the following:
• Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;
• Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at 
the commencement date;
• The exercise price of extension options if the Group and the Company are reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; and
• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group and the Company exercising 
that option.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, 
which is generally the case for leases in the Group and the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is 
used. This is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset 
of similar value to the ROU in a similar economic environment with similar term, security and conditions.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 
each period.
The Group and the Company present the lease liabilities as a separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position. 
Interest expense on the lease liability is presented within the finance cost in the Income Statement.
d) Reassessment of lease liabilities
The Group and the Company are also exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend 
on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease 
payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is remeasured and adjusted against the ROU 
assets.
Lease liabilities are also remeasured if there is a change in the Group’s and the Company’s assessment of whether 
it will exercise an extension option and there are modifications in the scope or the consideration of the lease that 
was not part of the original term.
e) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and 
small items of office furniture. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value 
assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Income Statement.

(ii) Accounting by lessor
Operating leases
Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial 
Position. They are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a basis consistent with similar owned property, plant 
and equipment. Lease income (net of any incentives given to lessees) is recognised on the straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Separating lease and non-lease components
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company allocate the consideration in 
the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on the stand-alone selling prices in accordance with the 
principles in MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
(d) Intangible assets
(i) Contract rights
Contract rights comprise acquired contracts and rights to contracts from business combination. These are amortised over 
the contractual period on a straight-line basis and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication 
that the contract rights may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of 
non-financial assets.
(ii) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisitions of subsidiaries and it represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the 
fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition. If the fair value of consideration 
transferred, the amount of non-controlling interest and the fair value of previously held interest in the acquiree are less 
than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree, the resulting gain is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing 
and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and value-in-use. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently 
reversed. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
(iii) Software assets
Software assets comprise in-house computer software development and specialised computer software. Software assets 
are amortised over 3 to 10 years and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the software 
assets may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
Software-as-a-service arrangements are service contracts providing the right to access the cloud provider’s application 
software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to 
the cloud provider’s application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of 
the costs incurred relate to the development of software code that enhances or modifies, or creates additional capability 
to, existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of, and the recognition criteria for, an intangible asset.

(iv) Service license
Represents cost of service license to treat raw water, supply and distribute the treated water to the consumers. The 
license is considered to have indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the license is 
expected to generate new cash inflows to the Group. Accordingly, the service license is not amortised but tested for 
impairment annually or more frequently, when indicators of impairment are identified.
(v) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise customer lists. Other intangible assets are amortised over the contractual period on a 
straight-line basis and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the other intangible 
assets may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
(e) Investment properties
Investment properties include those portions of buildings that are held for long-term rental yields and/or for capital appreciation 
and freehold land and/or land under leases that is held for long-term capital appreciation or for a currently indeterminate use. 
Investment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised in the 
Income Statement for the period in which they arise. Where the fair value of the investment property under construction is 
not reliably determinable, the investment property under construction is measured at cost until either its fair value becomes 
reliably determinable or construction is complete, whichever is earlier.
Cost included expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of self-constructed 
investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.
An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic 
benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset is recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which the item is derecognised. The amount of consideration to 
be included in the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of investment property is determined in accordance with the 
requirements for determining the transaction price in MFRS15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
Transfers are made to (or from) investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment 
property to owner-occupied property/inventories, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of 
change in use. If owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group accounts for such property in accordance 
with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.

(f) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or as and 
when events or circumstances occur indicating that an impairment may exist. Assets that are subject to amortisation are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of 
the impairment at each reporting date.
The impairment loss is charged to the Income Statement unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged 
to the revaluation surplus. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In respect of other assets, any subsequent increase 
in recoverable amount is recognised in the Income Statement unless it reverses impairment loss on a revalued asset in which 
case it is taken to revaluation surplus.
(g) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting except for subsidiaries that were consolidated prior 
to 1 July 2002 in accordance with Malaysian Accounting Standard 2 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions and Mergers’, the generally 
accepted accounting principles prevailing at that time.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of 
the Group.
The gain or loss on disposal of a subsidiary is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the Group’s share of the 
subsidiary’s net assets as of the date of disposal, including the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to 
that subsidiary and is recognised in the Income Statement. The exchange difference on return of capital is reversed when 
there is no change in ownership interests.

(g) Subsidiaries (continued)
(i) Acquisition method
The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations when the acquired sets of activities and 
assets meet the definition of a business. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set 
of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to 
create outputs. Under the acquisition method of accounting, subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The consideration transferred 
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. On an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the fair 
value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. If this consideration is lower than 
the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in the 
Income Statement (refer to material accounting policies Note 2(d)(ii) on goodwill).
(ii) Merger method
Acquisition of a subsidiary, YTL Power Generation Sdn. Bhd., was accounted for using merger accounting principles.
Under the merger method of accounting, the results of subsidiaries are presented as if the merger had been effected 
throughout the current and previous financial years. The assets and liabilities combined are accounted for based on the 
carrying amounts from the perspective of the common control shareholder at the date of transfer. On consolidation, the 
difference between the carrying values of the investment in the subsidiary over the nominal value of the shares acquired 
is taken to merger reserve.
On consolidation, the cost of the merger is cancelled with the values of the shares received. Any resulting credit difference 
is classified as equity and regarded as a non-distributable reserve. Any resulting debit difference is adjusted against any 
suitable reserve. Any share premium, capital redemption reserve and any other reserves which are attributable to share 
capital of the merged enterprises, to the extent that they have not been capitalised by a debit difference, are reclassified 
and presented as movement in other capital reserves.

(g) Subsidiaries (continued)
(iii) Transactions with non-controlling interests
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid 
and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses 
on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(iv) Change in control
Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-
controlling interests and the other component of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the 
loss of control is recognised in the Income Statement. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then 
such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity 
accounted investee or as a financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.
(h) Associates
Associates are entities in which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the associates but not control over those policies.
Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements by using the equity method of accounting 
and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any 
accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the carrying value of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interest in 
the associate, including any other unsecured obligations, the Group’s interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses 
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate.
The results of associates are taken from the most recent financial statements of the associates’ concerned, made up to dates 
not more than three months prior to the end of the financial year of the Group.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the associates; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Where necessary, in applying the equity method, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the associates 
to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group.
When the Group losses significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change 
in carrying amount recognised in the Income Statement. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes 
of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. Any amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets 
or liabilities.

(i) Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or 
more parties, where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the 
rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint ventures 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the joint operators have 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
Joint ventures
The Group’s interest in a joint venture is accounted for in the financial statements by using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses in the Income Statement and movements in reserves in 
other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equal or exceed its interests in the joint 
ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint 
ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the joint ventures; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Where necessary, in applying the equity method, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the 
joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group.
(j) Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates
Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses if any. 
Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately 
to its recoverable amount.
On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, the difference between disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in the Income Statement.
(k) Development expenditure
Development expenditure is generally expensed when incurred otherwise it is capitalised when it meets certain criteria that 
indicate that it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits and are amortised over the period of the 
projects. They are written down to their recoverable amounts when there is insufficient certainty that future economic benefit 
will flow to the enterprise.

(l) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average or first-in, first-
out basis. Inventories comprise primarily of raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, fuel and spare parts. The cost of 
work-in-progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on 
normal operating capacity. It excludes borrowing costs. Fuel and diesel oil held for generation of electricity are not written 
down below cost if the electricity generated is expected to obtain a gross margin at or above cost. Cost for this purpose 
includes the applicable costs required to enable the fuel and diesel oil to be used for the generation of electricity.
Inventories for oil trading are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations 
in price. These are at fair value less costs to sell, with changes in fair value less costs to sell recognised in the Income Statement 
in the period of change.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion 
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
(m) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets
(i) Classification
The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following measurement categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) or through profit 
or loss), and
• those to be measured at amortised cost.
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of 
the cash flows.
The Group and the Company reclassify debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those 
assets changes.
The Group and the Company irrevocably elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI. The 
Group and the Company consider this classification to be more relevant as these instruments are strategic investments 
of the Group and the Company and not held for trading purposes.
(ii) Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group and the 
Company commit to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

Financial assets (continued)
(iii) Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the Income Statement.
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows 
are solely payment of principal and interest (“SPPI”).
a) Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s and the Company’s business model for 
managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.
There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify their debt instruments:
• Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent 
SPPI are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised 
directly in the Income Statement and presented in other operating income/(expenses) together with foreign 
exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the Income Statement.
• Fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”): Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash 
flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. 
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or 
losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the Income Statement. 
When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other operating income/(expenses). Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses are presented in other operating income/(expenses) and impairment expenses are presented 
as separate line item in the Income Statement.
• FVTPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. The Group and 
the Company may also irrevocably designate financial assets at FVTPL if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates 
a mismatch created by assets and liabilities being measured on different bases. Fair value changes are recognised 
in the Income Statement and presented net within other operating income/(expenses) in the period which it 
arises.

b) Equity instruments
The Group and the Company subsequently measure all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s and the 
Company’s management have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no 
subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. 
Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in the Income Statement when the Group’s and the 
Company’s right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised in other operating income/(expenses) in the 
Income Statement as applicable.
(iv) Impairment
The Group and the Company assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (“ECL”) associated with its debt 
instruments carried at amortised cost and at FVOCI and financial guarantee contracts issued. The impairment methodology 
applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
The Group has six types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
• Trade receivables
• Unbilled receivables
• Contract assets
• Other receivables (including deposits, interest receivables and receivables from associate/joint venture)
• Amounts owing by related companies (fellow subsidiaries, immediate holding company and ultimate holding company)
• Financial guarantee contracts
The Company has three types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
• Other receivables (including deposits and interest receivables)
• Amounts owing by related companies (fellow subsidiaries, immediate holding company, ultimate holding company and 
subsidiaries)
• Financial guarantee contracts
While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, the 
identified impairment loss was immaterial.

(iv) Impairment (continued)
ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between present value of cash flows according to the 
contract and present value of cash flows the Group and the Company expect to receive, over the remaining life of the 
financial instrument. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to 
reimburse the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Group and the Company expect to 
receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.
The measurement of ECL reflects:
• an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
• the time value of money; and
• reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about 
past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
a) General 3-stage approach for other receivables and financial guarantee contracts issued
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company measure ECL through loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 
month ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly 
since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL is 
required. Note 36(b) sets out the measurement details of ECL.
b) Simplified approach for trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related 
companies which is trade in nature
The Group applies the MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” simplified approach to measure ECL which uses a lifetime ECL 
for all trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is 
trade in nature. Note 36(b) sets out the measurement details of ECL.
Significant increase in credit risk
The Group and the Company consider the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there 
is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group and the Company compare the risk of a default occurring on the asset 
as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group and the Company consider 
available reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.

(iv) Impairment (continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (continued)
The following indicators are incorporated:
• external credit rating (as far as available)
• actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to 
cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations
• significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtor, including changes in the payment 
status of debtor in the Group and changes in the operating results of the debtor.
Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past 
due in making a contractual payment.
Definition of default and credit-impaired financial assets
The Group and the Company define a financial instrument as default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-
impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:
a) Quantitative criteria
The Group and the Company define a financial instrument as default, when the counterparty fails to make contractual 
payment within 80 and 365 days of when they fall due.
b) Qualitative criteria
The debtor meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the debtor is in significant financial difficulty. The 
Group and the Company consider the following instances:
• the debtor is in breach of financial covenants
• concessions have been made by the lender relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty
• it is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
• the debtor is insolvent
Financial instruments that are credit-impaired are assessed on individual basis.

Groupings of instruments for ECL measured on collective basis
a) Collective assessment
To measure ECL, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies 
which is trade in nature have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics of customer’s behaviour and 
the days past due. The unbilled receivables, contract assets relate to unbilled amounts and amounts owing by related 
companies which is trade in nature have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the 
same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are 
a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by 
related companies which is trade in nature.
b) Individual assessment
Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, other receivables and amounts owing by related companies 
which are in default or credit-impaired are assessed individually.
(v) Write-off
a) Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in 
nature
Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in 
nature are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the 
Group, uneconomic collection and court orders.
Impairment losses are presented within ‘cost of sales’ in the Income Statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the same line item.
b) Other receivables and amounts owing by related companies
The Group and the Company write-off financial assets, in whole or in part, when the Group and the Company have 
exhausted all practical recovery efforts and have concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The 
assessment of no reasonable expectation of recovery is based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or 
assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount. The Group and the Company may write-off 
financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off will result in impairment gains.

(m) Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group and the Company 
become a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables and borrowings (see Note 2(r)). The Company’s financial 
liabilities include other payables and borrowings (see Note 2(r)). These are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial liability 
is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Income Statement.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when there is 
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must 
be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
(n) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is 
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates its hedges as cash 
flow hedges. Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
in the Income Statement when the changes arise.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objective and strategies for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 20 to the financial 
statements. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are shown in Note 26(a) to the financial statements. 
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is 
less than 12 months. The fair value of a trading derivative is classified as a current asset or liability.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(n) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (continued)
The fair value changes on the effective portion of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the Income Statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to Income Statement in the financial periods when the hedged item affects 
Income Statement (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). When the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously 
deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, 
plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.
(o) Financial guarantee
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group and the Company to make specified payments to reimburse 
the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of 
a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially 
measured at fair value.
The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the 
contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without guarantee, or the estimated 
amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank and deposits 
held at call with financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
included within borrowings in current liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position.

(q) Share capital
Ordinary shares and non-redeemable preference shares with discretionary dividends are classified as equity. Other shares are 
classified as equity and/or liability according to the substance of the contractual arrangement of the particular instrument.
Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings and accrued 
as liability in the financial year in which the obligation to pay is established.
Purchase of own shares
Where the Company purchases its own shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, 
net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued.
Should such shares be cancelled, the costs of the treasury shares are applied in the reduction of the profits otherwise available 
for distribution as dividends. Should such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the 
Company.
Where the treasury shares are subsequently distributed as dividends to shareholders, the costs of the treasury shares are 
applied in the reduction of the funds otherwise available for distribution as dividends.
(r) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method; any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings.
Interest relating to a financial instrument classified as a liability is reported within finance cost in the Income Statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borrowing cost incurred to finance the construction of property, plant and equipment that meets the definition of qualifying 
asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets during the period of time that is required to get ready the asset for its 
intended use.
(s) Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions are benefits received in respect of specific qualifying expenditure, and investment tax credits and 
tax benefits in respect of qualifying property, plant and equipment. These are released to the Income Statement over the 
expected economic useful lives of the related assets.

(t) Deferred income
The deferred income comprise assets transferred from customers in respect of services which are yet to be provided and 
shareholder loan interest revenue. Such amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and are 
amortised to the Income Statement over the expected economic useful lives of the related assets.
(u) Provisions
The Group and the Company recognise provisions when it has a present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate of the amount can be made. The recording of provisions requires the application of judgements about the ultimate 
resolution of these obligations. As a result, provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the Group’s 
and the Company’s current best estimate.
(v) Revenue recognition
Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group’s ordinary activities is recognised by reference to each 
distinct performance obligation promised in the contract with customer. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured 
at its transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
promised goods or services to a customer, net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Transaction price is 
allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services 
promised in the contract. Depending on the substances of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised 
when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time.
(i) Sale of electricity
The Group’s electricity is generated and sold into national electricity company or market in the respective countries in 
which the Group operates.
Revenue from the sale of electricity is recognised over time as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits 
provided by the Group’s performance when electricity is delivered based on contractual terms stipulated in respective 
agreements with customers.
Revenue is presented, net of goods and service tax, penalties, rebates and discounts. Collection of the contract consideration 
from customers is considered probable. No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has adopted the practical 
expedient available in MFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (“MFRS 15”) where the interval between transfer 
of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer is expected to be less than 12 months.
Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customer from the date of the last meter 
reading available and reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenue is recognised as receivables and is reversed in the 
following month when actual billings occur.

(ii) Supply of clean water and treatment and disposal of waste water
The Group has the rights to supply water and sewerage services to customers, together with an obligation to maintain 
and develop the network and ensure its continued availability.
The nature of the water industry in the UK is such that revenue recognition is subject to a degree of estimation. The 
assessment of water sales to customers is based on internal data where final settlement data is not yet available. At the 
end of each period, amounts of water delivered to customers are estimated and the corresponding billed and unbilled 
revenue is assessed and recorded in revenue. For the purpose of the judgement, various factors are considered such as 
seasonality, historic billing profiles, leakage data and general economic conditions.
For metered customers, revenue is determined by the meter reading. For unmetered customers, the amount to which 
the Group has a right to receive is determined by the passage of time during which the customer occupies a property 
within the Group’s licensed region. Revenue represents income receivable in the ordinary course of business, excluding 
Value Added Tax, for services provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits 
will flow to the Group.
Developer services related to the obligation under statute to allow property developers to establish an authorised 
connection to the water and/or sewerage network. In obtaining the connection, the developer may require the Group to 
undertake one or more of the following:
(i) Connections and meter installation in exchange for payment;
(ii) Requisitions of water mains in exchange for payment; and
(iii) Adoptions of water and wastewater mains.
The developer is also required to pay infrastructure charges being a contribution to network reinforcement.
These activities are not separable nor distinct and instead form a bundle of activities necessary to establish an authorised 
connection from which the network access can be obtained. Also, the Group has an additional obligation under statute 
to keep the connection in place for all current and future occupiers and facilitate ongoing access to the network for as 
long as the property requires service provision. Consequently, revenue from developer services will be deferred over the 
shorter of expected period of service provision or the need to replace the assets at the end of their useful life (typically 
in the range 60 to 125 years). No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has adopted the practical expedient 
available in MFRS 15 where the interval between transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer 
is expected to be less than 12 months.

(iii) Telecommunications
The Group generates revenue from providing telecommunication services, such as access to the network, airtime usage, 
messaging, and internet services as well as from sales of products. Products and services may be sold separately or in 
bundled packages. The typical length of a contract for bundled packages is 12 months to 36 months.
For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, i.e. if a 
product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from 
it. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their Relative Stand-alone 
Selling Prices (“RSSP”). The RSSP are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the products and 
telecommunication services. RSSP are based on observable sales prices; however, where RSSP are not directly observable, 
estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.
a) Telecommunication services
Telecommunication revenue from postpaid and prepaid services provided by the Group is recognised over time, as 
the benefits of telecommunication services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer.
Revenue from prepaid services is recognised when services are rendered. Starter packs with a sim card and reload 
voucher is accounted for as a single performance obligation as the sim card can only be used together with the 
services provided by the Group. Prepaid credits are recognised as contract liability in the Statement of Financial 
Position. Revenue is recognised when the credits are utilised or up to the point of customer churn or upon expiry, 
whichever is earlier.
Postpaid services are provided in postpaid packages which consist of various services (i.e. call minutes, internet data, 
sms and etc.). As the services are separately identifiable and the customers can benefit from each of the services 
on its own, each service is accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Postpaid packages are either sold separately or bundled together with the sale of device to a customer. As postpaid 
packages and device are capable of being distinct and separately identifiable, there are two performance obligations 
within a bundled transaction. Accordingly, the Group allocates the transaction price based on the RSSP of the postpaid 
packages and devices.
b) Sale of devices
Devices may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The Group recognises revenue when control of the device 
has transferred to the customer upon delivery and acceptance of the device at the point of sale.
For devices sold separately, the consideration is received in full at the point of sale. The amount of revenue recognised 
is measured at the consideration specified in the contract. For devices sold in bundled packages, the customers 
usually offered to pay at a discounted price on the device. The amount of revenue recognised for devices sold in 
bundled packages is measured at the allocated consideration based on the RSSP as explained previously.

b) Sale of devices (continued)
Devices that the Group promises to transfer as part of a bundled package with network service plans are considered 
distinct and thus accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Devices that are transferred as part of a fixed 
line telecommunication services bundled package which can only be used together with the services provided by 
the Group, are considered as a single performance obligation in telecommunications service revenue.
A contract asset is recognised when the Group delivers the devices before the payment is due. If the payment 
happens before delivery of device, then a contract liability is recognised. Contract assets and contract liabilities are 
presented within receivables and payables respectively in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group generates revenue from telecommunication infrastructure. Telecommunication infrastructure revenue is generated 
from the leasing of space on the Group’s telecommunication towers, where the customers install and maintain their individual 
communication network equipment, and from construction of telecommunication infrastructure. The leasing revenue is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the fixed and non-cancellable term of the lease agreement, irrespective of when 
payments are due. For the construction of telecommunication infrastructure, see accounting policy Note 2(v)(vii) to the 
financial statements on construction contracts.
(iv) Sale of steam
Revenue from sale of steam is recognised over time as the Group’s customers simultaneously receive and consume the 
benefits arising from the Group performance of its obligations based on the terms of the contracts with the customers. 
(v) Investment income
Investment income earned by the Group and the Company are recognised on the following bases:
Dividend income – When the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Interest income – On an effective interest basis.
(vi) Lease income
Lease income earned by the Group is recognised on the following bases:
Tank leasing fees – Tank leasing fees from operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Rental income – Rental income from operating leases (net of any incentive given to the lessees) is 
recognised on the straight-line basis over the lease term.

(vii) Construction contracts
Under such contracts, the Group is engaged to construct buildings and related infrastructure and in certain instances to 
supply equipments. These contracts may include multiple promises to the customers and therefore accounted for as 
separate performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated based on relative stand-alone selling 
price of the considerations of each of the separate performance obligations. When these are not directly observable, they 
are estimated based on expected cost plus margin.
Revenue from construction contracts is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the agreement.
The Group determines the transaction price of a contract after considering the effect of variable consideration, constraining 
estimates of variable consideration, effect of significant financing component, non-cash consideration and consideration 
payable to customer.
When the fair value of variable consideration is uncertain, the Group estimates the amount of consideration by using the 
most likely amount method and only recognises to the extent that is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative 
revenue will not occur.
Revenue is recognised as and when control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group 
would collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that would be transferred to the 
customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may 
transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the performance of the Group 
does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for 
performance completed to date.
If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the 
progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation using the input method, which is based on the 
total actual construction cost incurred to date as compared to the total budgeted costs to the respective construction 
projects.
If control of the asset transfers at a point in time, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains 
control of the asset.

(viii) Others
Other income earned by the Group is recognised on the following bases:
Sale of natural gas – Revenue from sale of natural gas is recognised over time as and when the Group’s 
customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits arising from the Group 
performance when natural gas is supplied. 
Sale of fuel oil – Revenue from sale of fuel oil is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied 
by transferring control of fuel oil to the customer upon delivery (i.e. at a point in time). 
Management, operation and 
maintenance fees
– Management, operation and maintenance fees are recognised over the period in which 
the services are rendered.
Hotel operations – Hotel room revenue is recognised over time during the period of stay for the hotel 
guests. Revenue from food, beverage and other ancillary services are generally recognised 
at the point in time when the services are rendered.
(w) Contracts with Customers
(i) Contract assets
Contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods and services that the Group has transferred to a 
customer. If the Group transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are 
subject to impairment assessment based on the ECL model. Contract assets are presented within “Receivables, deposits 
and prepayments” of the Statement of Financial Position.
(ii) Contract liabilities
Contract liability is the unsatisfied obligation by the Group to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the 
Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays 
consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the 
payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the 
Group performs the services under the contract. Contract liabilities are presented within “Payables and accrued expenses” 
and “Payables” of the Statement of Financial Position.
(iii) Contract cost assets
The Group capitalises sales commissions as costs to obtain a contract with a customer when they are incremental and 
expected to be recovered more than a year. The Group expects to recover these costs in the future through 
telecommunication services revenue earned from the customer. The Group also capitalises the expenditure on assets 
such as water mains/sewers or new connections relating to contracts as they are incurred to fulfil the contract.
Sales commissions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the specific contract to which the cost relates 
to. Amortisation of contract costs are included as part of direct cost within “Cost of sales” in the Income Statement. 
While, the expenditure on assets are treated as cost of sales when the contract is complete.
An impairment loss is recognised to the Income Statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost 
asset recognised exceeds the remaining amount of considerations that the Group expects to receive for the specific 
contract that the cost relates to less additional costs required to complete the specific contract.

(x) Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the financial period 
in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and the Company.
(ii) Post-employment benefits
The Group has various post-employment benefit schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the industries 
in which it operates.
These benefit plans are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.
a) Defined contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into 
a separate entity (a fund) on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and will have no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior financial periods.
The Group’s and the Company’s contributions to defined contribution plan are charged to the Income Statement in 
the financial period to which they relate.
b) Defined benefit plan
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a 
function of one or more factors such as age, years of service or compensation.
The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting 
date minus the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Re-measurement gains and losses of post-employment benefit obligations are recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.

the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share options is recognised as an expense in the Income 
Statement over the vesting periods of the grant with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options 
granted and the number of share options to be vested by vesting date. At each reporting date, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. For options granted to subsidiaries, 
the expense will be recognised in the subsidiaries’ financial statements over the vesting periods of the grant.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital when the options 
are exercised.
(y) Income taxes
Current tax expense is determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group operates and includes all 
taxes based upon the taxable profits, including withholding taxes payable by a foreign subsidiary, associated company or joint 
venture on distributions of retained earnings to companies in the Group.
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts attributed 
to assets and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax is not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint 
ventures except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s share of income taxes of joint ventures and associates are included in the Group’s share of profits of investments 
accounted for using the equity method.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability is settled.

(z) Foreign currencies
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(ii) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the Income Statement.
(iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency 
as follows:
• assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that Statement of Financial Position;
• income and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
• all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken 
to shareholder’s equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of or sold, such exchange differences that were recorded 
in shareholders’ equity are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity on or after 1 July 2011 are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. For acquisition of foreign entities completed 
prior to 1 July 2011, goodwill and fair value adjustments continued to be recorded at the exchange rate at the respective 
date of acquisitions. This is in accordance to the adoption of MFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of Malaysian Financial Reporting 
Standards”.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(aa) Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
The Group and the Company do not recognise a contingent liability but disclose its existence in the financial statements, except 
in a business combination.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and the Company or a present 
obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or it cannot be measured reliably. However, contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and the Company. The Group and 
the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose their existence where inflows of economic benefits are probable, 
but not virtually certain.
In the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group under a business combination, the contingent liabilities assumed are measured 
initially at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests.
The Group recognises separately the contingent liabilities of the acquirees as part of allocating the cost of a business combination 
where the fair values can be measured reliably. Where the fair values cannot be measured reliably, the resulting effect will be 
reflected in the goodwill arising from the acquisitions.
(ab) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the 
operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Director primarily responsible for the financial statements of the 
Group.
Transactions between segments are carried out on mutually agreed basis. The effects of such inter-segment transactions are 
eliminated on consolidation. The measurement basis and classification are consistent with those adopted in the previous 
financial year.
(ac) Service concession contracts
The Group has entered into a number of concession contracts granted by several public sector customers (“grantors”). The 
characteristics of these contracts vary significantly depending on the country and activity concerned.
In order to fall within the scope of concession contract, a contract must satisfy the following two criteria:
• the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide 
them, and at what price; and
• the grantor controls the significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.
Such infrastructure is not recognised in assets of the operator as property, plant and equipment but in financial assets (“financial 
asset model”) and/or intangible assets (“intangible asset model”) depending on the remuneration commitments given by the 
grantor.

2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(ac) Service concession contracts (continued)
(i) Intangible asset model
The Group applies the intangible asset model where the operator is paid by the users or where the concession grantor 
has not provided a contractual guarantee in respect of the amount recoverable. The intangible asset corresponds to the 
right granted by the concession grantor to the operator to charge users of the public service.
Intangible assets resulting from the application of this policy are recorded in the statement of financial position under 
the heading ‘Service Concession Assets’ and are amortised, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contract term.
Cash flows relating to these intangible assets are included in net cash generated from/(used in) operating activities in 
the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Revenue associated with this intangible asset model includes revenue from the construction of the infrastructure on a 
percentage of completion basis and operating revenue of the infrastructure.
(ii) Financial asset model
The financial asset model applies when the Group has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset 
from the grantor.
In the case of concession services, the Group has such an unconditional right if the grantor contractually guarantees the 
payment of amounts specified or determined in the contracts; or the shortfall, if any, between amounts received from 
users of the public service and amounts specified or determined in the contract.
Financial assets resulting from the application of this policy are recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position 
under the heading ‘operating financial assets’ and recognised at amortised cost.
Cash flows relating to these operating financial assets are included in the net cash generated from/(used in) operating 
activities in the consolidated statement of cash flow.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of these assets exceeds the fair value, as estimated during 
impairment tests. Fair value is estimated based on the recoverable amount, calculated by discounting future cash flows 
(value in use method).
The portion falling due within less than one year is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as 
‘Current operating financial assets’, while the portion falling due within more than one year is presented in the non-current 
heading.
Revenue and finance income associated with this financial asset model include revenue from the construction of the 
operating financial assets on a percentage of completion basis, operation and maintenance revenue; and finance income 
related to the capital investment in the operating financial assets.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
(a) Impairment assessment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, in accordance with its accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of significant 
judgements and estimates as set out in Note 13 to the financial statements.
(b) Capitalisation of infrastructure assets in property, plant and equipment
Due to the high value of capital expenditure on infrastructure assets, judgements made on the classification of expenses as 
operating or capital, and within capital between maintenance and enhancement, are key to the preparation of the accounts. 
These judgements are based on engineering experience of differentiating between treatment as a repair or a replacement of 
an infrastructure asset. 
(c) Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and investment
The Group assesses impairment of the assets or cash-generating units (“CGUs”) whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable i.e. the carrying amount of the asset is more 
than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) 
for that asset or CGU and its value-in-use (“VIU”). Projected future cash flows used in impairment testing of the assets or CGUs 
are based on Group’s estimates calculated using historical, sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, 
changes in technology and other available information.
The recoverable amounts of the asset or CGUs are determined based on VIU or FVLCD calculations. These calculations require 
the use of estimates. The calculations are inherently judgemental and susceptible to change from period to period because 
they require the Group to make assumptions about revenue growth rate, discount rate and terminal multiple.
The assumptions used and results of the impairment assessment of investment in a subsidiary and PPE are disclosed in Note 
14(c) and Note 10 to the financial statements, respectively.
(d) Assessment on allowance for impairment of trade receivables of water and sewerage segment
The expected credit loss on outstanding receivables is a key estimate under MFRS 9. The Group estimate of recoverability by 
grouping customers into similar economic profiles and applying a percentage loss rate based on forward-looking judgements 
on the future collection rates that are likely to be achieved. This has included additional considerations of the possible impact 
of the ongoing economic uncertainty on the expected collection rates of outstanding receivables. A 1% reduction in collection 
rates would increase the expected credit loss allowance by RM33.7 million.

3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(e) Estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment
The Group reviews the useful lives of its PPE at each reporting date and any adjustments are made on a prospective basis as 
changes in accounting estimates. The useful lives of the PPE are assessed periodically based on the conditions of the equipment, 
market conditions and other regulatory requirements. 
(f) Assumptions used in determining the post-employment benefit plans
The present value of the post-employment benefit plans depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial 
basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income are disclosed in Note 30 to 
the financial statements. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of post-employment benefit plans.
(g) Revenue recognition from accrued income
The unbilled income accrual from metered water services of the water and sewerage segment requires an estimation of the 
amount of unbilled charges at the period end. This is calculated based on average customer volume usage adjusted for 
seasonality and regulatory price changes. A 2% movement in average consumption equates to a RM6.5 million movement in 
the unbilled income accrual.
(h) Investment properties
The Group carries its investment properties at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in the Income Statements. 
For investment properties, a valuation methodology is adopted which involves comparison to developments of a similar nature, 
location and condition. The sensitivity analysis is disclosed in Note 12(b) to the financial statements.
(i) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised. This involves judgment regarding future financial performance of respective entities 
when the deferred tax assets are recognised.

Under the Malaysia Finance Act 2018 which was gazetted on 27 December 2018, the Group’s unutilised tax losses in Malaysia 
tax entities with no expiry period will be imposed with a time limit of utilisation. Any accumulated unutilised tax losses brought 
forward from year of assessment 2018 can be carried forward for another 7 consecutive years of assessment. The Malaysia 
Finance Act 2021 has subsequently extended the utilisation period to 10 years. With that, the expiry dates of the Group’s tax

The Group has undistributed earnings from subsidiaries incorporated outside Malaysia, could be subject to tax if distributed. An 
assessable temporary difference exists, but no deferred tax liability has been recognised as the Group is able to control the timing 
of distributions from these subsidiaries and is not expected to distribute these profits in the foreseeable future.
The Group and the Company are within the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 
Two model rules whereby top-up tax on profits is required in any jurisdictions in which it operates, calculated at the jurisdictional 
level, when the effective tax rate is lower than the minimum effective tax rate of 15%.
Malaysia will be implementing the Pillar Two model rules effective 1 January 2025. Some foreign tax jurisdictions where the Group 
operates (such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) will implement the Pillar Two model rules earlier in 2024.
The Group and the Company have not recorded any impact on tax expense for the financial year and apply the exception to 
recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in 
the amendments to MFRS 112 issued in June 2023.
The Group and the Company have assumed the commitment to apply the Pillar Two model rules and are working on the analysis 
of the impact of the amendments to the standard as well as to establish a system of compliance which allows to adapt to regulations 
in a timely manner.

Borrowing cost of RM53,861,225 at an interest rate of 5.9% was capitalised during the financial year 2023.
The Group revised the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment during the financial year ended 30 June 2023. The revision was accounted for 
as a change in accounting estimate and as a result, the depreciation charge for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 decreased by RM31.9 million. Assuming 
the assets are held until the end of their estimated useful lives, depreciation in relation to these assets will decrease by approximate RM124.6 million per 
annum.

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of a subsidiary
The recoverable amount of the PPE assessed as part of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) is determined based on the fair value less 
costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) calculation.
The following are the key assumptions applied in the FVLCD calculation for impairment assessment of PPE of a subsidiary in the 
telecommunications segment:
2024 2023
Discount rate 8.2% 9.2%
Average revenue growth rate 45.1% 49.4%
Terminal year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) margin 18.0% 26.7%
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is derived from the cost of capital at the date of the assessment.
The cash flow projections used in the FVLCD calculation were based on approved financial budgets and forecasts covering a 5 year 
period, adjusted to reflect market participants assumptions. Cash flows beyond the 5 year period were extrapolated a further 11 
(2023: 12) years representing the estimated useful lives of the PPE of the subsidiary, using the estimated long-term growth rate 
of 2.1% (2023: 2.5%).

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of a subsidiary (continued)
Fair value is held within Level 3 in fair value hierarchy disclosures.
The carrying amount of the CGU as at 30 June 2024 is RM2.3 billion (2023: RM2.3 billion). No impairment charge was recognised as 
the recoverable amount of the CGU was in excess of its carrying amount.
If the discount rate increased by 3% (2023: 4%), the carrying value will be reduced by approximate RM188 million (2023: RM68 
million). If the average revenue growth rate reduced by 1% (2023: 2%), the carrying value will be reduced by approximate RM128 
million (2023: RM74 million). And, if the terminal year EBITDA margin reduced by 3% (2023: 7%), the carrying value will be reduced 
by approximate RM13 million (2023: RM21 million).

Inter-relationship between 
key unobservable inputs 
and fair value measurement
Market approach:
The valuation considers the present value of future 
cashflows to be generated should the Western 
Framework of the site be sold in parcels, net of 
the infrastructure cost of ensuring all parcels are 
fully serviced. The sales values are determined 
based on the market rate today for each use class. 
The expected cashflows are discounted using a 
discount rate which considers the cost of debt, 
the risk free rate, the nature and composition of 
the cashflows and their associated market 
conditions.
–  Residential land value per  
  acre (2024: RM8.9 million,  
  GBP1.5 million)
–  Commercial land value per  
  acre (2024: RM4.4 million,  
  GBP0.8 million)
–  Discount rate (2024: 8%)
The estimated fair value would 
increase (decrease) if:
–   the density per acre was  
  higher (lower)
–   land values were higher  
  (lower)
–   absorption by the market was  
  quicker (slower)

Details of the fair value of land and buildings in the United Kingdom is as follows: (continued)
Valuation technique
Significant 
unobservable inputs
Inter-relationship between 
key unobservable inputs 
and fair value measurement
Income approach:
The valuation model considers the present value 
of net cash flows to be generated from the 
development of each parcel in the Eastern 
Framework, subdivided into asset classes taking 
account of attainable revenues, construction and 
development costs and developer margins. The 
expected cashflows are discounted using a 
discount rate which considers the cost of debt, 
the risk free rate, the nature and composition of 
the cashflows and their associated market 
conditions.
– Residential unit density per 
  acre, ranging from 18–250
  units (2023: 18–28)
– Infrastructure costs remaining
  and delivery of same
– Residual land values for each 
  asset within each plot
– Discount rate (2024: 8%,
  2023: 8%)
– Assumption that certain  
  infrastructure costs will be 
  shared between the wider 
  development and the  
  Arena, the split of which  
  is not included in a formal  
  agreement between the  
  entities
The estimated fair value would 
increase (decrease) if:
 –   the density per acre was  
  higher (lower)
 –   infrastructure costs  
  remaining were lower  
  (higher)
 –   residual land values were  
  higher (lower)
 –   discount rate was lower  
  (higher)
In determining the fair value, the valuer has used valuation techniques which involve certain estimates. In relying on the 
valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation methods and estimates are reflective 
of current market conditions. The estimates underlying the valuation techniques in the next financial year may differ from 
current estimates, which may result in valuation that may be materially different from the valuation as at reporting date. A 
1.0% (2023: 1.0%) change in the discount rate would lead to a movement of RM26.0 million (2023: RM11.4 million) in the 
valuation.
Management is satisfied that the valuation reflected in these statements is reasonable. In making this assessment, management 
has reviewed the estimated cash flows for the development and the future rent roll which continue to support the valuation 
presented within the financial statements. Management constantly monitors market data which shows conditions have been 
strong despite the cost of living crisis, further justifying the valuation included in these statements.
Fair value is held within Level 3 in fair value hierarchy disclosures for investment properties.
(c) Contractual obligations and restrictions
The Group has no restrictions on the realisability of its investment properties and no contractual obligations to purchase, 
construct or develop investment properties.

(a) Impairment test for goodwill
The Group undertakes an annual test for impairment of its cash-generating units (“CGUs”).
Goodwill is allocated for impairment test to the individual entity which is also the CGUs identified according to the respective 
companies.
The following CGUs, being the lowest level of asset for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, have carrying 
amounts of goodwill that are considered significant in comparison with the Group’s total goodwill:
Group
2024
RM’000
2023

Power generation segment (“Singapore”) 8,531,609 8,475,867
Water and sewerage segment (United Kingdom (“UK”)) 440,700 440,700
Ranhill Utilities Berhad 259,604 –
Others 146,149 146,821
Total goodwill 9,378,062 9,063,388
The amount of goodwill initially recognised is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, 
to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement.
The recoverable amount of the CGU of Ranhill Utilities Berhad is determined based on fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) 
calculation. FVLCD is determined based on quoted market price and is held within Level 1 in fair value hierarchy disclosures. 
No impairment charge was recognised for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 as the recoverable amount of the CGU was 
in excess of its carrying amount.
(i) Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
The following assumptions have been applied in the value-in-use calculation:
2024 2023
Singapore

Discount rate 6.80 4.45 6.53 2.96
Terminal growth rate 2.00 6.74 2.00 3.29
Revenue growth rate 3.80 11.01 3.37 4.39
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations apply 
a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU. The discount rates applied to the cash 
flow projections are derived from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium at the date of the assessment of 
the respective CGU.

(a) Impairment test for goodwill (continued)
(i) Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations (continued)
For power generation segment (“Singapore”), cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculation were based on 
approved financial budgets and forecasts covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period were 
extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated above. The growth rate did not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate in which the CGU operates.
The terminal growth rate indicates the expected growth of cash flows after the forecast period of five years.
The revenue growth rate is calculated using the Compound Annual Growth Rate method and applied on the current year’s 
sales figures over the forecast period.
For water and sewerage segment (“UK”), cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculation were based on approved 
financial budgets and forecasts covering an one-year (2023: two-year) period, to conform the final determinations approved 
by OFWAT, the economic regulator of the water sector in England and Wales.
(ii) Impact of possible change in key assumptions
The circumstances where a change in key assumptions will result in the recoverable amounts of goodwill on the CGUs 
to equal the corresponding carrying amounts assuming no change in the other variables are as follows:
2024 2023
Singapore
%
UK
%

Revenue growth rate 0.50 (78.61) 0.80 (29.55)
Based on the above assessment, no impairment charge for the goodwill was recognised for the financial year ended 30 
June 2024 (2023: Nil) as the recoverable amount of the CGUs was in excess of its carrying amount.

(c) Impairment assessment for investment in a subsidiary
The recoverable amount of the investment in a subsidiary is determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) 
calculation.
The following are the key assumptions applied in the FVLCD calculation for impairment assessment of a subsidiary in the 
telecommunications segment:
2024 2023
Discount rate 9.2% 10.3%
Terminal multiple 14.3x 13.0x
Average revenue growth rate 45.1% 49.4%
Terminal year EBITDA margin 19.7% 28.2%
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections are derived from the cost of equity at the date of the assessment of 
the investment in the subsidiary. The cash flow projections used in the FVLCD calculation were based on approved financial 
budgets and forecasts by board of subsidiary, adjusted to reflect market participants assumptions.
Fair value is held within Level 3 in fair value hierarchy disclosures.
The circumstances where a change in key assumptions will result in the recoverable amount of investment in subsidiary to 
equal the corresponding carrying amount assuming no change in other variables are as follows:
2024 2023
Discount rate 12.3% 12.3%
Terminal multiple 12.6x 11.9x
Average revenue growth rate 44.4% 48.8%
Terminal year EBITDA margin 17.2% 26.2%
The carrying amount of the subsidiary is RM4.6 billion (2023: RM3.9 billion). No impairment charge was recognised as the 
recoverable amount was in excess of its carrying amount.

activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities. Land is transferred from investment properties to property development costs 
under current assets when development activities have commenced and are expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. These are 
measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value is assessed by considering the expected future revenues and the total 
costs to complete the development.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in ‘cost of sales’ amounted to RM206 million (2023: RM111 million). 
These were recognised as an expense during the financial year and included in ‘cost of sales’.

20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(a) Fuel swaps
Fuel swaps are entered into to hedge highly probable forecast fuel purchases that are expected to occur at various dates within 
1 to 47 months (2023: 1 to 29 months) from financial year end. The fuel swaps have maturity dates that match the expected 
occurrence of these transactions. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve prior to the occurrence of these transactions 
are transferred to the inventory of fuel upon acquisition or cost of sales upon consumption of natural gas. The gains and losses 
relating to fuel oil inventory are subsequently recognised in the Income Statement upon consumption of the underlying fuel.
The fair value of fuel swaps is determined using a benchmark fuel price index at the reporting date.
(b) Currency forwards
Currency forwards are entered into to hedge highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency expected 
to occur at various dates within 1 to 49 months (2023: 1 to 31 months) from financial year end. The currency forwards have 
maturity dates that match the expected occurrence of these transactions.
Gains and losses relating to highly probable forecast fuel payments are recognised in the hedging reserve prior to the occurrence 
of these transactions and are transferred to the inventory of fuel upon acquisition or cost of sales upon consumption of natural 
gas. The gains and losses relating to fuel oil inventory are subsequently transferred to Income Statement upon consumption 
of the underlying fuel.
For those currency forwards used to hedge highly probable forecast foreign currency payments of purchases of property, plant 
and equipment, the gains and losses are included in the cost of the assets and recognised in the Income Statement over their 
estimated useful lives as part of depreciation expense.
For those currency forwards used to hedge highly probable forecast foreign currency transactions for maintenance contracts, 
the gains and losses are included in payments and recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the contracts.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting 
date.

(b) Defined benefit plan – Malaysia
A subsidiary of the Group, Ranhill SAJ Sdn. Bhd., operates a defined benefit retirement scheme for its eligible employees, which 
is unfunded. The estimated obligations under the retirement benefit scheme are based on actuarial valuation report prepared 
by a qualified independent actuary on 5 April 2023 covering the period from 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2025.
The retirement benefit obligations are made for the non-funded benefits plan. The liability is accrued at the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations using the projected unit method.

(c) Defined benefit plan – United Kingdom 
A subsidiary of the Group operates final salary defined benefit plans for its employees in the United Kingdom, the assets of 
which are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The latest actuarial valuation of the plan was undertaken by a qualified 
actuary as at 30 September 2022. This valuation has been adjusted to the reporting date as at 30 June 2024 taking account 
of experience over the period since 30 September 2022, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and 
demographic assumptions by the qualified actuary.
(i) Profile of the scheme
The defined benefit obligations include benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners. Broadly, 
about 24% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 14% to deferred pensioners and 62% to current 
pensioners. 
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made. For the scheme as 
a whole, the duration is approximately 13-14 years, reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation 
between current employees (duration of c18-19 years), deferred members (duration of c17-18 years) and current pensioners 
(duration of c10-11 years).
(ii) Funding requirements
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation report, 30 September 2022 
showed a deficit of GBP35.3 million (RM210.4 million).
The subsidiary paid GBP18.4 million (RM108.6 million) on 30 June 2023 which, along with investment returns from return-
seeking assets, has made good the shortfall. The next funding valuation is due no later than 30 September 2025, at 
which progress towards full-funding will be reviewed.
The subsidiary also pays contributions of 15.5% of pensionable salaries in respect of current accrual and non-investment 
related expenses. 
(iii) Risk associated with the scheme
Asset volatility - The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities 
including a diversified growth fund and a global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure 
it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields - A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme’s liabilities for 
accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings. 
Inflation risk - The majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to 
higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme 
inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an 
increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. 
Life expectancy - The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. 
Risk management - The trustees insure certain benefits payables on death before retirement.

(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign currency exchange risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group and the Company are exposed to risks arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the 
United States Dollar (“USD”). Where necessary, the Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to 
limit its exposure on foreign currency receivables and payables and on cash flows generated from anticipated transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies.
The following table demonstrates the impact to the Group’s and the Company’s profit after tax and equity to strengthening/
weakening of USD, with all other variables held constant.

Interest rate exposure arises from the Group’s and the Company’s borrowings, deposits, short-term investments and 
interest-bearing advances to subsidiaries of the Company. This exposure is managed through the use of fixed and floating 
rate debts, as well as through derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, to generate the desired interest rate 
profile.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows to interest rate risk. However, this 
is partially offset by the interest income accruing on fixed deposits and income funds.

At the reporting date, if annual interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower respectively, with all other variables 
in particular foreign exchange rates and tax rates being held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s profit after tax 
and equity will be lower/higher by RM40.8 million (2023: RM54.8 million) and RM2.6 million (2023: RM6.4 million), 
respectively as a result of increase/decrease in interest expense on these variable rate borrowings.
The Group and the Company manage their liquidity risks by placing excess funds of the Group and the Company in bank 
deposits and other highly liquid investments to match its cash flow needs. If interest deposit rates increased/decreased 
by 10 basis points, interest income for the Group and the Company for the financial year would increase/decrease by 
RM9.1 million (2023: RM8.0 million) and RM1.2 million (2023: RM1.5 million), respectively.
(iii) Price risk
Investments
The Group and the Company are exposed to equity securities and income funds price risk arising from investments held 
which are classified on the Statement of Financial Position either as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVTOCI”) or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”). 
To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group and the Company diversify their portfolio. 
For income funds, the Group and the Company mainly invest in AAA rated bonds. This investment is meant to achieve 
better yield as compared to fixed deposits. At the reporting date, if the prices of the income funds at FVTPL increased/
decreased by 1% (2023: 1%) with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s 
profit after tax and equity will be higher/lower by RM9.6 million (2023: RM12.4 million) and RM0.9 million (2023: RM4.2 
million), respectively.

(a) Market risk (continued)
(iii) Price risk (continued)
Fuel commodity price risk
The Group hedges its fuel commodity price risk by the use of derivative instruments against fluctuations in fuel oil prices 
which affect the cost of fuel.
The Group has contracts for the sale of electricity to the Singapore electricity pool at prices that are fixed in advance 
every three months and to retail customers at prices that are either fixed in amount or in pricing formula for periods up 
to a number of years. The fixing of the prices under the contracts is based largely on the price of fuel oil required to 
generate the electricity. The Group enters into fuel swaps to hedge against adverse price movements of fuel oil prices. 
The Group typically enters into a swap to pay a fixed price and receive a variable price indexed to a benchmark fuel price 
index.
Exposure to price fluctuations arising from the purchase of fuel oil and natural gas are substantially managed via swaps 
where the price is indexed to a benchmark price index, for example 180 CST fuel oil and Dated Brent. The Group’s exposure 
to the fluctuation of forward price curve is immaterial.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a counter party to settle their obligations to the Group 
and the Company. 
The Group’s exposures to credit risk arise primarily from trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and other 
receivables. For other financial assets (including short-term investment securities, fixed deposits and derivative financial 
instruments), the Group minimises credit risk by dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Company’s exposures to credit risk arise primarily from other receivables and amounts owing by related companies. For 
other financial assets (including short-term investment securities and fixed deposits), the Company minimises credit risk by 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, customers are mainly segregated according to business segments. In the Group’s 
power generation business in Singapore, credit reviews are performed on all customers with established credit limits and 
supported by collateral in the form of guarantees for selected customers.
For the Group’s water and sewerage business, the credit risk of receivables is mitigated through strict collection procedures. 
In the Group’s telecommunications business, the credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through a credit policy. The 
Directors are of the view that credit risk arising from these businesses is limited due to the large customer base.

Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies 
The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring ECL which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade 
receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in nature. To measure 
the ECL, trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics 
and the days past due.
The expected loss rates are determined based on between 1 to 10 (2023: 1 to 10) years of historical ageing profiles and the 
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period as applicable. The historical loss rates are adjusted to 
reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables. 
Some of the factors which the Group has identified include unemployment rates, economic trends, and annual Gross Domestic 
Product (“GDP”) growth. The Group has adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in such factors. The 
Group’s estimate of recoverability of the contract assets is based on forward-looking judgement on the future collection rate 
that are likely to be achieved. 
On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts 
owing by related companies as follows:

Note:
(1) The expected loss rate comprises of customers with different risk profiles.
Cash and bank balances
The Group and the Company place its cash and bank balances with a number of creditworthy financial institutions. The Group’s 
and the Company’s policy limit the concentration of financial exposure to any single financial institution. While cash and bank 
balances are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
Derivative financial instruments
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are allowed only with counterparties that are of high credit quality. As 
such, management does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The Group considers the risk of material 
loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counter party to be unlikely.

(b) Credit risk (continued)
Other receivables and amounts owing by related companies
The Group and the Company use the 3-stages approach for ECL on other receivables and amounts owing by related companies. 
The 3-stages approach reflects their receivables’ credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each of those 
categories.
A summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group’s and the Company’s ECL model is as follows:
Category Group’s and Company’s definition of category Basis for  
 recognising ECL
Performing Debtors have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet 
contractual cash flows
12 month ECL
Underperforming Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit risk or 
significant increase in credit risk is presumed if interest and/or principal 
repayments are 30 days past due
Lifetime ECL
Non-performing Debtors and repayments are more than 80 to 365 days past due Lifetime ECL
Write-off There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or assets 
to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount
Asset is written off
Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL using a PD x LGD x EAD methodology 
where:
• PD (‘probability of default’) - the likelihood that the debtor would not be able to repay during the contractual period;
• LGD (‘loss given default’) - the percentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens; and
• EAD (‘exposure at default’) - the outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk.
In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group and the Company consider historical data by each debtor by category and adjusts for 
forward-looking macroeconomic data. The Group and the Company have identified the industry and geographical area which 
the debtor operates in to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected 
changes in these factors. Loss allowance is measured at a probability-weighted amount that reflects the possibility that a 
credit loss occurs and the possibility that no credit loss occurs. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions 
were made during the reporting period.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient bank deposits and marketable securities, the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic 
nature of the underlying businesses, the Group and the Company aim at maintaining flexibility by keeping committed credit 
lines available.

As at 30 June 2024, the current liabilities of the Company include RM0.70 billion (2023: RM1.24 billion) of borrowings. The said 
borrowings will be refinanced or repaid from existing undrawn facilities and the Group’s unencumbered cash. 
(d) Capital risk
The objectives of the Group and the Company when managing capital are to safeguard the ability of the Group and the Company 
to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain 
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are external debt covenants, such as gearing and debt service coverage ratio applicable to the Group and gearing 
ratio to the Company, which are not onerous and these obligations can be fulfilled. As part of its capital management, the 
Group rigorously monitors compliance with these covenants. In addition, consistent with others in the industry, the Group 
and the Company monitor capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. 
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including ‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the Statement of 
Financial Position) less cash and bank balances. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the Statement of Financial 
Position plus net debt.

To strengthen the capital structure of the Company, all borrowings of subsidiaries are undertaken on a non-recourse basis to 
the Company save and except for those borrowings guaranteed by the Company as set out in Note 28 to the financial 
statements.
(e) Fair value measurement
The Group and the Company measure fair value using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the 
input used in making the measurements:
(a) Level 1 - quoted price (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities;
(b) Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
(c) Level 3 - inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
The Group and the Company used last transacted price in arriving at the fair value of the investment for the financial assets 
included in the Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
