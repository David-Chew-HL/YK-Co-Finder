TAN SRI (SIR) FRANCIS YEOH SOCK PING, PSM, KBE
Executive Chairman
This was a sterling year for our Group as we saw revenue 
and profits at their highest-ever levels, and operating 
performance across all business divisions remained strong.
We declared two interim dividends amounting to 6.0 sen 
per share in respect of the 2023 financial year. This is 
the 26th consecutive year in our dividend track record 
since listing on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange in 1997, 
and a 33% increase over last year. In safeguarding the 
financial resilience of our Group, we continue to maintain 
a stable and prudent financial structure and, as always, 
decisions about dividends are performance-driven with 
a view to ensuring ongoing financial strength.
Protecting the long-term viability and sustainability of 
our businesses is a core tenet of our strategy and this 
year proved no different in reinforcing how vital this has 
been to the growth and development of our Group.
As our long-term shareholders will know, YTL PowerSeraya, 
which we acquired during the Global Financial Crisis, 
served as a bulwark for our Group against the global 
economic downturn and volatility that ensued. 
YTL POWER INTERNATIONAL BERHAD
06 STRATEGIC & PERFORMANCE REVIEW
EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

---- Page 9 ----
Having successfully navigated the structural issues plaguing the 
market in recent years, we now see the turnaround and return to 
stability.
Around the same time, in 2010, we started on our path towards 
digital transformation with our 4G telecommunications business, 
leading the way in democratising the availability of high-speed 
internet access across the Peninsula. 
With the headway made towards 5G over the last year, and new 
digital banking and green data center businesses, our journey has 
become more interesting than ever, opening up the possibilities of 
advanced new technologies and applications. When we look ahead 
to our new growth areas, we take the same long-term view that 
has served our Group so well since inception.
In a similar vein, we have now owned Wessex Water for over 20 
years, making us the longest single owner of a UK water and 
sewerage company. We have a demonstrable track record of 
responsible ownership and Wessex Water is one of the best 
performers in the sector. Nevertheless, unprecedented criticism 
from the public, media and politicians about the state of rivers and 
the impact of storm overflows in the UK over the past year has 
necessitated a reassessment of investment programmes and 
priorities throughout the industry.
Solving this problem will take many years of sustained effort and 
investment. It is also vital that the solutions employed stand the 
test of time, against a background of climate emergency and 
changing rainfall patterns, and Wessex Water will pursue nature-
based treatments and solutions wherever possible.
In considering the wider environment in which we operate and 
the many stakeholders that our activities impact, a long-term 
outlook is the only viable approach towards ensuring the ongoing 
success, resilience and sustainability of our Group. 
As we embark on a new year, we remain committed to continuing 
to provide the essential services on which our millions of 
customers are reliant, and operating in a way that delivers the 
best outcomes for our communities and the longevity of our 
organisation.
TAN SRI (SIR) FRANCIS YEOH SOCK PING

Economic Review
The Malaysian economy registered a strong recovery in 2022, with 
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 8.7%, exceeding pre-
pandemic levels. Recovery was driven by the realisation of pent-up 
demand following the full upliftment of COVID-19 containment 
measures, resilient export performance, higher tourism activity and 
continued policy support. In 2023, Malaysia’s economy expanded by 
5.6% in the first quarter but growth eased in the second quarter to 
2.9% due to weaker external demand (sources: Bank Negara Malaysia 
updates & reports).
In other major economies where the Group operates, the United 
Kingdom recorded GDP growth of 4.1% for the 2022 calendar year. 
As a result of high inflationary pressures, the UK economy only 
expanded 0.2% in the first quarter of 2023 and 0.4% in the 
second quarter on a year-on-year basis. Singapore’s economy 
expanded by 3.6% in 2022. Growth moderated to 0.4% and 0.5% 
on a year-on-year basis in the first and second quarters of 2023 
(sources: Singapore Ministry of Trade & Industry, UK Office for National 
Statistics updates & reports) .

EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

---- Page 10 ----
OVERVIEW
I am pleased to report that our Group achieved our highest-ever profit after tax of 
RM2.03 billion this year on the back of revenue of RM21.9 billion, also a record high. 
This significant improvement in performance was driven primarily by our power generation 
business under YTL PowerSeraya in Singapore. Our water and sewerage business in the 
UK and telecommunications business in Malaysia faced challenges but operating 
performance remained stable.
With about 97.1% of our Group’s revenue being generated from overseas businesses, the 
results were also bolstered by foreign exchange gains for the financial year under review. 
This enabled us to continue to reward shareholders, with two interim cash dividends 
declared in respect of the 2023 financial year, amounting to 6.0 sen per share, a 33% 
increase over 4.5 sen per share last year.
DATO’ YEOH SEOK HONG
Managing Director
REGIONAL EVOLUTION
Singapore’s electricity market continues to 
see a return to stability with lower price 
volatility in the wholesale market. Against 
this backdrop, YTL PowerSeraya delivered 
a strong set of results, with last year’s 
acquisition of Tuaspring Power Plant by 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Taser Power Pte 
Ltd, the newest and most efficient on the 
grid, contributing to the growth in 
generation market share. 
With our unique positioning in Malaysia 
and Singapore, we aim to play our part  
in lowering the carbon footprints of both 
countries by facilitating the export of 
green energy from Malaysia, supplementing 
Singapore’s existing capacity as Malaysia 
continues to accelerate its growth in 
renewable energy generation capacity.
Over the medium to longer term, we are 
pursuing upstream decarbonisation efforts 
by developing clean energy solutions and 
actively sourcing low carbon electricity 
generation. This will also facilitate the 
unlocking of downstream opportunities 
through sustainable electrification and 
carbon abatement solutions. 
In January 2023, we signed a joint venture 
agreement with TNB Power Generation 
Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Tenaga Nasional Berhad, for the export 
and import 100 MW of electricity from 
Malaysia to Singapore via a newly 
upgraded interconnector. 
This strategic alliance marks the inaugural 
electricity import from Malaysia to 
Singapore commercially under the  
Malaysian Energy Commission’s Guide for 
Cross-Border Electricity Sales. This initiative 
will diversify Singapore’s energy sources, 
further enhancing its energy security, and 
is a significant step towards the vision of a 
strong ASEAN power grid.

MANAGING DIRECTOR’S REVIEW

---- Page 11 ----
In line with Singapore’s objective to deploy 
12,000 electric vehicle (EV) chargers at 
public housing estates’ carparks by 2025, 
a joint venture company ChargEco was 
formed in November 2022 between YTL 
PowerSeraya and Strides Mobility, a 
leading mobility solutions and services 
provider and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Singapore’s SMRT Corporation Ltd, to 
install, operate and maintain 1,200 EV 
chargers in Singapore.
ONGOING RESILIENCE
Strong financial foundations and operational 
performance have continued to underpin 
the provision and delivery of leading service 
levels for Wessex Water’s customers and 
communities in the UK. 
Wessex Water continues to exemplify the 
safe haven protection that regulated assets 
add to our Group. This year, Wessex Water’s 
regulated asset base (RAB) value increased 
11% to £4.1 billion (RM24.4 billion) from 
£3.7 billion (RM21.8 billion) last year. 
Over the longer term, we expect to continue 
to see ongoing growth in RAB owing to 
inflationary trends in the UK and the 
industry-wide re-examination of the capital 
expenditure needed for infrastructure 
improvements. A higher RAB value in turn 
has the effect of decreasing our gearing 
in terms of Wessex Water’s debt-to-RAB 
ratio, and will further reinforce our financial 
position.
On the operational front, Wessex Water 
continues to champion innovation and 
markets to drive down costs and customer 
bills. In particular, this revolves around 
implementing nature-based solutions and 
partnerships, which would have multiple 
benefits in keeping costs down, having a 
lower carbon footprint, supporting nature 
recovery and improving resilience, fully in 
line with our Group’s priorities.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
We forged ahead this year on the digital 
transformation front, led by our green data 
center business and encompassing our 5G 
telecommunications and new digital bank 
venture. 
Progress is well underway on Phase 1 of 
the YTL Green Data Center Park in Kulai, 
Johor, which will be the first data center 
campus in Malaysia to be powered by on-
site renewable energy. 
In January this year, we mandated Malayan 
Banking Berhad and OCBC Bank (Malaysia) 
Berhad as joint lead arrangers for a RM1.1 
billion Islamic term financing facility for 
Phase 1, with a commitment to secure Gold 
LEED certification, and in compliance with 
Green Loan Principles published by the Loan 
Market Association, Asia Pacific Loan Market 
Association and Loan Syndications and 
Trading Association. 
The transaction signifies YTL Power’s 
ongoing commitment towards transitioning 
to a green and circular economy while 
contributing to our environmental objectives 
of climate change mitigation and the 
promotion of green buildings. 
The YTL Green Data Center Park will be 
powered by our solar power generation 
facility of up to 500 MW. Ultimately, the 
Park will provide data storage co-location 
services to clients looking for more 
sustainable and lower carbon solutions 
within Southeast Asia, serving as the 
foundation for our greater objective of 
carbon neutrality for our data centers across 
the region.
We made excellent progress this year with 
our 5G offerings. YES 5G was awarded 
Malaysia’s fastest mobile network speed in 
Q3-Q4 2022 and again in Q1-Q2 2023 by 
Ookla, the global leader in fixed broadband 
and mobile network testing applications, 
data and analysis. 
Our services also picked up four awards at 
the Malaysian Communications and 
Multimedia Commission (MCMC) Star Rating 
Awards, amongst them ‘Best Quality of 
Service’ and ‘Best in Consumer Satisfaction’.
Meanwhile, work is ongoing towards 
commencement of operations on our digital 
bank, the licence for which our Group in 
consortium with Sea Limited was awarded 
by Bank Negara Malaysia in April 2022.
OUTLOOK
Our core businesses delivered another strong 
year of operating performance and remain 
well-grounded in the face of growing 
economic, environmental and geo-political 
volatility. 
Meanwhile, our new businesses in green 
data centers, solar power generation and 
other renewable energy solutions driving 
digital transformation bolster the outlook 
and prospects for our Group, moving into 
the future.

GROUP OVERVIEW
OBJECTIVES & STRATEGIES
The YTL Power Group pursues the geographic diversification and 
expansion of its revenue base through greenfield developments 
and strategic acquisitions both domestically and overseas, 
focusing on regulated and other utility assets, and businesses 
correlated to its core competencies, with the goal of maximising 
stakeholder value and building and operating strong businesses 
that are viable and sustainable on a long-term basis.
The YTL Power Group derives the bulk of its revenue from 
operating various regulated assets under long-term concessions 
and/or licences and other utility assets, enabling the Group to 
achieve stable earnings and mitigate the downside risks arising 
from economic uncertainties or changing operating conditions, 
both in Malaysia and globally.
The principal components of the YTL Power Group’s strategy 
comprise:
•
 Diversification and expansion of the Group’s revenue 
base through both greenfield projects and strategic
 
acquisitions in Malaysia and overseas, particularly in 
the area of regulated utilities
The YTL Power Group pursues a strategy of acquiring 
regulated assets operating under long-term concessions. The 
Group’s existing overseas operations in this area continue to 
generate steady returns and its overseas acquisitions diversify 
income streams, enabling the Group to mitigate single-country 
and single-industry risks.
•
 Growth and enhancement of the YTL Power Group’s
 
core businesses 
The Group’s strategy to continue to grow its businesses is to 
leverage its expertise in its core competencies, particularly in 
the areas of power generation, water and sewerage services 
and telecommunications.
This includes investing in more sustainable renewable energy 
solutions. In implementing its strategy, the Group focuses 
strongly on governance, compliance and managing the 
economic, environmental and social impacts of its businesses 
to ensure the long-term sustainability and viability of its 
operations.
•
 Development of superior asset quality with increasing 
regulatory asset value over time 
The YTL Power Group’s regulated assets demonstrate ongoing 
growth, with the regulated asset value of these assets
 
increasing over time. Wessex Water’s regulatory capital value, 
for example, has grown from GBP1.3 billion (approximately 
RM7.7 billion) when it was acquired by YTL Power in 2002 to 
GBP4.1 billion (approximately RM24.4 billion) as at 30 June 
2023.
•
 Ongoing optimisation of the Group’s capital structure 
The YTL Power Group maintains a balanced financial structure 
by optimising the use of debt and equity financing and
 
ensuring the availability of internally generated funds and 
external financing to capitalise on acquisition opportunities. A 
key component of the Group’s growth strategy is its practice 
of funding the debt component of its acquisitions and 
greenfield projects largely through non-recourse financing 
which has ensured that the Group only invests in projects that 
are commercially viable on a stand-alone basis.  
•
 Enhancement of operational efficiencies to maximise 
returns from the Group’s businesses and delivery of
 
high-quality services to its customer base 
The Group believes that its utility assets on average operate 
within the highest efficiency levels of their industries and 
further enhances operational efficiencies where possible 
through the application of new technologies, production 
techniques and information technology, to ensure the delivery 
of efficient, high-quality services to its customer base.

REVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Group Financial Performance
The YTL Power Group recorded higher revenue of RM21,890.5 million for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 compared to RM17,804.7 
million for the previous financial year ended 30 June 2022. Profit before taxation increased to RM2,449.5 million for the financial year under 
review, compared to RM1,642.0 million recorded in the previous financial year. The improved performance was primarily due to the Power 
Generation segment.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2023, overseas operations accounted for approximately 97.1% of the Group’s revenue, compared to 
96.1% for the previous financial year ended 30 June 2022, whilst operations in Malaysia contributed 2.9% of the Group’s revenue in the 
current financial year compared to 3.9% for the previous financial year.

---- Page 19 ----
(a) Power Generation
The 
Power Generation segment recorded higher revenue of 
RM16,217.0 million for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 
compared to RM12,721.0 million for the previous financial 
year ended 30 June 2022, and an increase in profit before 
taxation to RM2,464.0 million this year compared to RM690.3 
million last year. 
The increase in revenue and profit before taxation was 
mainly due to higher retail and pool prices, coupled with the 
strengthening of the Singapore Dollar against the Malaysian 
Ringgit.
(b)
 Water & Sewerage
The 
Water & Sewerage segment recorded higher revenue of 
RM4,265.8 million for the financial year under review over 
RM4,109.5 million last year, mainly due to improved trading 
and new contracts within the non-household retail market. 
The loss before taxation of RM94.8 million recorded this 
year over profit before taxation of RM378.0 million recorded 
last year was primarily attributable to interest accruals on 
index-linked bonds, which had a non-cash impact of RM272.1 
million (GBP51.4 million). The inflationary pressures on costs 
will be compensated in future years tariff revenues.
(c)
 Telecommunications
T
he Telecommunications segment recorded lower revenue 
of RM600.6 million for the financial year under review 
compared to RM678.0 million last year, and loss before 
taxation widened to RM268.6 million from RM196.7 million 
last year due to lower project revenue recorded.
(d)  Investment Holding Activities
The 
Investment Holding Activities segment recorded higher 
revenue of RM807.1 million this year compared to RM296.2 
million last year, attributable mainly to higher interest 
income and recognition of accrued technical service income 
following the commercial operation of the Jordan oil shale-
fired power generation project (“Jordan Project”).
Profit before taxation decreased to RM348.9 million in the 
current financial year as compared to RM770.4 million last 
year due mainly to the absence of a net gain on the 
ElectraNet disposal, partially offset by higher foreign 
exchange gains, higher interest income and accrued technical 
service income derived from the Jordan Project.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
On 24 August 2023, the Board of Directors of YTL Power (“Board”) declared a second interim dividend of 3.5 sen per ordinary share in 
respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2023 with book closure and payment dates of 10 November 2023 and 29 November 2023, 
respectively.
The total dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 amounted to 6.0 sen per ordinary share.
The Board did not recommend a final dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2023.
Dividend Policy
The Board has not adopted a set dividend policy. It is the present intention of the Directors to continue to propose the payment of cash 
dividends on an annual basis, subject to future earnings and the financial condition of YTL Power and other factors, including the profit 
and cash flow position of the YTL Power Group, restrictions imposed by law or under credit facilities on the payment of dividends by 
members of the YTL Power Group and the availability of funds. 
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing its capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are external debt covenants, such as gearing ratios applicable to the Group, which are not onerous and these obligations can be 
fulfilled. As part of its capital management, the Group rigorously monitors compliance with these covenants. 
In addition, consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated 
as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings, as shown 
in the Statement of Financial Position) less cash and bank balances. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the Statement of 
Financial Position, plus net debt.

Statements in this Annual Report. 
Under Practice Note 17 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Securities, the Company is required to maintain consolidated 
shareholders’ equity equal to or not less than the 25 percent of the issued and paid-up capital (excluding treasury shares) and such

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
SEGMENT OVERVIEW
YTL Power owns a 100% equity interest in YTL PowerSeraya, a 
Singapore-based energy company with a total licensed generation 
capacity of 3,100 MW, consisting of combined-cycle plants, co-
generation combined-cycle plants and steam turbine plants. 
Situated on Jurong Island, Singapore’s oil, gas and petrochemicals 
hub, YTL PowerSeraya is a diversified energy company with a 
core business centered on the generation and retailing of 
electricity, in addition to operating other multi-utility businesses 
comprising utilities supply (steam, natural gas and water), oil 
storage tank leasing and oil trading and bunkering. 
The Group is also undertaking a solar power facility with a 
generation capacity of up to 500 MW in Johor, Malaysia. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
For the financial year under review, YTL PowerSeraya sold 10,040 
gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity, a 12.6% increase from the 
previous financial year, while generation market share saw a 
strong annual increase of 3.9% following the Group’s successful 
completion last year of its acquisition of Tuaspring Power Plant by 
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Taser Power Pte Ltd. The electricity 
market has stabilised, which led to lower volatility of prices in the 
Singapore wholesale electricity market except for hotter months, 
which saw a surge in electricity supply commitments.
A keen focus on maintaining plant reliability saw the timely 
completion of major and minor maintenance inspection activities 
on combined cycle and co-generation power plant units. Several 
key measures were implemented progressively over the past 
years and have improved plant reliability, such as Failure Mode 
Effect Analysis (FMEA) and Master Trip Logic Reviews to prevent 
forced outages, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to prevent recurrence 
of outages and an Operational ‘near-miss’ Incident Framework for 
early detection and rectification of plant abnormalities.
Upon successful diversion of the house load from the Tuas South 
Desalination 6.6kV switchboard for two Circulating Water Pumps 
to the Group’s own electrical switchboard, YTL PowerSeraya 
managed to achieve significant monthly cost savings and 
optimised electricity distribution.
POWER GENERATION
Several digitalisation initiatives have also been implemented, such 
as plant performance, training and safety tracking dashboards 
and Operation Digitalisation through the use of Self Serving 
applications.
Continued emphasis on the importance of maintaining high 
standards in quality, environmental, energy, health and safety as 
well as cyber security management systems saw re-certifications 
of ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO45001, ISO27001 and BizSafe Star 
successfully completed, as well as audit compliance with the 
ISO50001 standard under Singapore’s National Environmental 
Agency’s Energy Management System requirement during the 
year. In addition, the Group successfully obtained the SS 651 
standard, which is a standard developed specifically for the 
chemical industry in Singapore on occupational safety and health 
management systems.
Support of the company’s ongoing digital transformation agenda 
focused on three key areas for the year under review, namely 
data and analytics, application modernisation and cybersecurity. 
As part of its commitment to continuous advancement, YTL 
PowerSeraya’s embrace of application modernisation included 
the completion of several upgrading, cloud migration and re-
platforming projects over the year.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
These initiatives have led to improvements in system performance 
and efficiency, increased scalability, an enhanced overall security 
posture and ensured compliance for the company. Further 
information on the Group’s cybersecurity and data protection 
work can be found in the Environmental, Social & Governance 
Report 2023 in this Annual Report.
Retail
YTL PowerSeraya’s retail brand, Geneco, held a market share of 
13.5% in the electricity retail market (based on retail volume over 
total system demand), with a sales volume of 7,408 GWh for the 
financial year under review. The retail market comprises customers 
from the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. 
In April 2023, Geneco expanded availability of its innovative green 
Power Eco Add-on 2.0 to all of its residential customers, at any 
point of their contracts. As at 30 June 2023, Geneco had 3,408 
customers who had opted for Power Eco Add-on. This 2.0 initiative 
is in line with Geneco’s commitment to supporting The Singapore 
Green Plan 2030 and building a more sustainable future for the 
nation by encouraging its customers to do their part for the 
environment.
As part of its digitalisation journey, Geneco launched Small & 
Medium Business (SMB) Online in May 2023 to empower SMB 
customers with single premises and a load size of less than 20 
megawatt hours (MWh) per month, to sign up online. This self-
service portal optimises operational requirements and provides 
automation to its business processes. In less than two months, as 
at 30 June 2023, 123 SMB customers had signed up via this new 
portal. 
Fuel Management
YTL PowerSeraya’s fuel management arm demonstrated resilience 
and achieved a commendable performance through the strategic 
approach of successfully securing higher tank leasing rates and 
optimising infrastructure assets. This is especially notable given 
the challenges in the oil industry, ranging from geopolitical 
conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine situation to global energy security 
concerns, coupled with slower-than-expected global economic 
recovery and inflationary pressures leading to higher interest 
rates.
The division efficiently managed a substantial volume of 8.24 
million metric tonnes of fuel oil and diesel, a notable increase 
from the previous year’s 7.48 million metric tonnes. Moreover, the 
surge in berthing for bunkering and cargo vessels saw 837 vessels 
at the terminal, a significant increase from 644 vessels in the 
previous year, with an average berth utilisation rate of 41.85%, 
demonstrating the division’s commitment to optimal resource 
utilisation.
Strategic efforts in optimising tank leasing and fuel management 
activities further underpinned the division’s success and an 
unwavering focus on enhancing these core aspects will position 
the company for continued growth in the fuel management sector.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
SEGMENT OVERVIEW
In the UK, YTL Power owns a 100% equity interest in Wessex 
Water, a regional water and sewerage business serving 2.9 million 
customers across a geographic area of approximately 10,000 
square kilometres in the south west of England, including Dorset, 
Somerset, Bristol, most of Wiltshire and parts of Gloucestershire 
and Hampshire.
Wessex Water is regulated by the Water Services Regulation 
Authority (known as Ofwat), the economic regulator for the UK 
water industry, and holds a licence from the UK government 
under an instrument of appointment to supply clean water and 
treat and dispose of waste water from its operating region in the 
south west of England.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Wessex Water faced a challenging year, with extremely high 
energy prices and inflation in the UK. Nevertheless, its strong 
financial foundations have continued to underpin the provision 
and delivery of leading service levels for Wessex Water’s customers 
and communities. 
As the provider of an essential service, Wessex Water prioritised 
the mobilisation of support for its customers and communities 
who needed it most. Customers continued to be offered extensive 
financial and debt support through a range of schemes and low-
rate tariffs under Wessex Water’s tailored assistance programme 
(tap). This was increased during the year under review as 
customer incomes were increasingly squeezed by inflation and 
the high cost of living. The division aims to triple the number of 
customers on its financial support schemes over the next few 
years, making help even easier and quicker to access. 
Despite the challenges, complaints from customers about the 
taste, odour or appearance of their water fell for the fourth 
consecutive year. Wessex Water met its target on water quality at 
home and in the workplace, where activity saw a return to pre-
Covid levels, and achieved its best-ever performance on 
interruptions to supply, which moved further down to an average 
of 4 minutes 10 seconds per property, from 4 minutes 12 seconds 
in 2021.
While water discharge compliance remained very high at 99.4%, 
this was below the 100% target so process improvements have 
been implemented to restore and maintain compliance at specific 
sites. 
Following public concern in the UK over storm overflows, Wessex 
Water is taking immediate action to steadily eliminate or improve 
on the 1,300 overflows on its 35,089 kilometres of sewers. 
Investment has been increased to GPB3.0 million per month – at 
no additional cost to customers – to make a 25% reduction in the 
operation of storm overflows by 2025, from the 2020 level. After 
2025, Wessex Water is proposing a threefold increase in 
investment to GBP9.0 million per month, with the aim of fully 
treating or eliminating any discharge from storm overflows by 
2050.  
The division remains on track for its three-year average leakage 
target, despite 2022 being a difficult year due to both the extreme 
heat-drought in the summer and a significant freeze-thaw event 
in the winter.
Wessex Water’s trajectory of diminishing annual gross greenhouse 
gas emissions continued this year, with its lowest annual 
operational carbon footprint since reporting began in 1997.

Governance Report 2023 in this Annual Report.

YTL Power owns a 60% stake in YTL Comms, which provides 
high-speed 4G and 5G services in Malaysia.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Reflecting on the 2023 financial year, YTL Comms continued to 
invest in its network and technology, expand its reach and 
introduce new products and services. YES 5G focused on building 
its brand awareness through community-building campaigns and 
collaborations with well-known organisations. As a result of these 
efforts, YES has performed well and has been awarded various 
prestigious awards.
YES was awarded Malaysia’s fastest mobile network speed in Q1-
Q2 2023 by Ookla®, the global leader in fixed broadband and 
mobile network testing applications, data and analysis. Assessed 
and determined by Ookla Speedtest Intelligence® data analysis, 
YES landed at the No.1 spot for two consecutive years (YES was 
the winner for Q3-Q4 2022 as well) with top download speeds of 
562.81 Mbps and top upload speeds of 70.59 Mbps, surpassing 
the competition. 
On 22 December 2022, YES swept four awards from the MCMC 
Star Rating Awards 2021 – Best in Quality of Service, Best in 
Consumer Satisfaction, Best in Corporate Social Responsibility 
and, significantly, Best Mobile Network Operator with Less Than 
Five Million Subscribers. 
Throughout the pandemic, the YES network held up well under 
heavy usage and delivered essential quality service to the 
customers. Additionally, working together with YTL Foundation and 
FrogAsia, YES provided 1.5 million free 4G SIM cards and 1 million 
free 4G smartphones that in aggregate consumed over 200 million 
GB of 4G data through YTL Foundation’s Learn from Home Initiative. 
Not only is this program unique and impactful, it also shows how 
well the modern, all-IP YES network has performed when many 
other legacy networks struggle under extraordinary usage stress. 
YES also managed to lead the way and became the first telco in 
Malaysia to launch 5G – a full nine months ahead of all other 
telcos in Malaysia. Not only does YES now have the highest 
quality 5G services, YES provides the most cost competitive 5G 
postpaid and 5G prepaid plans in Malaysia. For example, the YES 
Power 35 postpaid plan offers 100GB of 5G and 4G data with no 
speed cap for only RM35/month, while its YES Prepaid FT5G 
Unlimited plan offers Unlimited 5G and 4G data with 30 days of 
validity for only RM30/month. These plans are some of the lowest 
price 5G tariffs globally. True to its roots, YES has again demonstrated 
there is no compromise between pricing and performance.
Beyond providing world-class service at most affordable pricing, 
YTL Comms worked ceaselessly to drive awareness.

run, The Wave showcased the power of YES 5G coverage in 
Malaysia. In line with the telco’s mission to provide accessible 
and affordable Internet connectivity to all Malaysians, The Wave 
signifies the arrival of YES 5G coverage throughout the country.
•
 On 22 July 2023, YES 5G partnered with Nothing, an innovative 
smartphone brand to launch the Nothing Phone (2) with YES
 
5G postpaid plans. The exclusive partnership offered the 
Nothing Phone (2) to consumers at no cost with a subscription 
to YES 5G’s Infinite+ Ultra Plan.
•
 YES supported the Government’s call for cost-effective 5G

tiers of society. Through the Ramah Programme, YES led the 
industry with the lowest-cost package – a totally free 5G 
smartphone with 100GB of uncapped 5G data package for 
merely RM35/month.
This is but a short list of activities to illustrate the energy and 
commitment demonstrated by YES to deliver on the mission of

data centers in Malaysia and Singapore via its wholly-owned 
subsidiary, YTL Data Center Holdings Pte Ltd (“YTLDC”), as well as 
digital banking in Malaysia. In the UK, the Group’s wholly-owned 
subsidiary, YTL Land and Property (UK) Limited (“YTL Property 
UK”), is developing Brabazon Bristol, a 380-acre residential and 
commercial project. The Group also has a 45% equity interest in 
APCO, which owns a 554 MW oil shale-fired project in Jordan, and 
an effective interest of 20% in Jawa Power, which owns a 1,220 
MW coal-fired power station in Java, Indonesia. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Data Centers
The Group has embarked on the development of the YTL Green 
Data Center Park in Kulai, Johor. This will be the first data center 
campus in Malaysia to be co-powered by on-site renewable solar 
energy. To date, the Group has partnered with Sea Limited as a 
co-locator to anchor this world-class green facility.
The campus will incorporate innovative and sustainable solutions 
in design and operations to achieve high-energy efficiency and is 
expected to serve a growing demand in the region for eco-
friendly, cost-efficient data center solutions from hyperscalers 
and co-location customers alike.
Progress is well underway on Phase 1 of the YTL Green Data 
Center Park, scheduled for completion in the first quarter of the 
2024 calendar year.
Digital Banking
In April 2022, the Group in consortium with Sea Limited was 
awarded a digital banking licence by Bank Negara Malaysia and 
work is well underway towards commencement of operations.
This new venture, which will leverage multiple synergies between 
the Group and Sea Limited, will enable the Group to further 
contribute to the growth of Malaysia’s digital transformation and 
broaden access of its citizens to financial services, particularly the 
underserved and underbanked, as well as micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs).
Brabazon
YTL Developments UK Limited (“YTL Developments”), a wholly-
owned subsidiary of YTL Property UK, is undertaking one of the 
UK’s largest master planned developments, located on the former 
Filton Airfield site. Brabazon Bristol is a 380-acre mixed-use urban 
development and the Group’s first UK property development 
project.
Awards won this year include Residential Project of the Year (36 
Homes and Over) – Michelmores Property Awards 2023; 
Residential Developer – Insider South West Property Awards 
2023; and Developer of the Year – Bristol Property Awards 2022.
Masterplan Densification
Planning approval from South Gloucestershire Council is currently 
pending for the proposed update to the development’s Masterplan. 
The approval will allow the new Masterplan to deliver up to 6,500 
residential homes, student accommodation units, 4 million sqft of 
commercial floor area and approximately 1 million sqft of 
educational and community facilities.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Residential 
YTL Developments is currently delivering the first phase at 
Brabazon, known as The Hangar District, comprising 302 
residential units apportioned to 127 landed and 175 apartment 
units. Half of these homes are now completed and occupied, with 
the remainder set to complete in stages up to the third quarter of 
2024. All open-market homes are sold in staggered releases, and 
to date, all have been sold off-plan with no voids accrued.
In July 2023, YTL Developments received planning permission for 
the next phase of 339 new homes at Brabazon. The designs for 
the second phase retain many of the distinctive features that 
have made The Hangar District such a success. Construction for 
this phase has begun and the first homes are scheduled for 
completion in late 2024.
The Retirement Village is orientated towards active elderly 
retirees who require minimum care and desire to be part of an 
urban community with walkable access to parks and the town 
center. The target market includes downsizers and parents who 
want proximity to family and convenience but, at the same time, 
independence. The approval for 229 units is expected by the 
fourth quarter of the 2023 calendar year.
Community
In November 2022, YTL Developments received planning approval 
to create a 15-acre public park at the center of Brabazon. Part of 
the Masterplan re-design, Brabazon Park consolidates a number of 
dispersed public open spaces into one more sustainable leisure 
destination. Once complete, Brabazon Park will be the largest new 
urban park in the southwest for more than 50 years, and will 
include a 3-acre lake that forms part of the water attenuation 
strategy.
In April this year, YTL Developments also received approval to 
transform a Grade II listed aircraft hangar into a new local, social 
community hub, designed to bring people together and promote 
active and sustainable living at Brabazon.
Spread over two floors, the hub is programmed with a café, library 
and wellness center as the ground floor anchors. On the upper 
level, a large hall will be a social space for multi-faith groups and 
venue for public meetings and family events. A range of activity 
rooms will offer space for after-school clubs and community 
groups, while the wellness center will offer cardio machines, 
weight-training facilities and group sessions.
Infrastructure
Discussions are ongoing on the new rail service will connect the 
train station at Brabazon to Bristol Temple Meads in less than 15 
minutes. Future expansion aspirations include a direct connection 
to Bristol Parkway train station, enabling direct onward 
connections to London Paddington in 1 hour 12 mins.
 
The station design has been upgraded to cater for YTL Arena 
Bristol, allowing up to 2,000 people on event nights to travel to 
the arena by train. The square has also been enlarged to allow for 
safe crowd management during event days and to minimise 
queue times.
Commercial
YTL Arena Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of YTL Property 
UK, is progressing well with the development of YTL Arena 
Bristol, situated at the legendary Brabazon Hangars, the birthplace 
of the Concorde. The Arena will feature the region’s largest
 column-
less exhibition and convention halls with 6,000 sqm of floor area, 
height clearance of 21 metres and banqueting capacity for 4,000, 
together with a flexible hub for entertainment, film, television
 
and music rehearsals.

SEGMENTAL REVIEW
Following pandemic-related delays to the project APCO 
successfully achieved COD for Unit 1 and Unit 2 in October 2022 
and May 2023, respectively. 
The 554 MW power plant is the first in Jordan to utilise the 
country’s indigenous oil shale resources which will account for 
approximately 15% of its installed power generation capacity. 
This will reduce the Kingdom’s import of oil products for power 
generation, and its development is a key milestone in the Jordanian 
government’s goal of furthering its energy independence. 
APCO is indirectly owned by YTL Power (45%), Guangdong Energy 
Group of China (45%) and Eesti Energia AS of Estonia (10%).
Jawa Power
Jawa Power’s 1,220 MW power station supplies power to 
Indonesia’s national utility company, PT PLN (Persero), under a 
30-year power purchase agreement. O&M for Jawa Power is 
carried out by PT YTL Jawa Timur, a subsidiary of YTL Power, 
under a 30-year agreement. Jawa Power’s performance remained 
stable during the year under review. 
YTL Arena Bristol will be at the heart of a vibrant new community 
at Brabazon. The project is in the final stages of design. Work has 
begun on key pieces of infrastructure required including new 
road connections, establishing new power supplies and site 
preparation works. 
 
In the meantime, the Brabazon Hangars have already been host 
to a number of film and TV productions and music rehearsals. 
Last year, Queen + Adam Lambert made use of the vast space to 
rehearse for their Rhapsody Tour. ITV’s popular period drama 
‘Sanditon’ filmed series two and three at the Hangars, and both 
Amazon Prime and Netflix have filmed episodes onsite. Formula 1 
team Alpine most recently used the space for the launch event 
of their new electric car, with both team drivers on-site for the 
test drive.
APCO
In Jordan, YTL Power has a 45% equity interest in APCO, the 
owner of a 554 MW oil shale-fired mine-mouth power generation 
project. APCO has signed a 30-year power purchase agreement 
(including construction period of 3.5 years) with the National 
Electric Power Company (“NEPCO”), Jordan’s state-owned utility, 
for the entire electrical capacity and energy of the power plant, 
with an option for NEPCO to extend the power purchase 
agreement to 40 years (from the commercial operation date 
(“COD”) of the project’s second unit).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION & ANAL YSIS

RISK MANAGEMENT
The overall risk management objective of the YTL Power Group is 
to ensure that adequate resources are available to protect its 
assets and to create value for its stakeholders. Risk management 
is carried out through regular risk review analysis, internal control 
systems and adherence to the Group’s risk management policies. 
The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves the 
appropriate control environment frameworks.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, 
including market risk (comprising foreign currency exchange risk, 
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and 
capital risk. The Group focuses on the unpredictability of financial 
markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its 
financial performance. 
Further details on the Group’s financial risk management can be 
found in Note 35 of the Financial Statements in this Annual 
Report.
OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Concessions & Key Contracts
A number of the Group’s businesses and projects are reliant, in 
some cases to a significant extent, on concessions or other key 
contracts. Cancellation, expiration, termination or renegotiation of 
any such concession or key contract or the imposition of restrictive 
regulatory controls could have an adverse effect on the financial 
condition and results of operations of certain subsidiaries of YTL 
Power and accordingly, the Group as a whole. 
However, the Group’s strategy of investing in regulated assets 
with long-term concessions or contracts has enabled it to establish 
a solid track record and operating performance to date, and is a 
measure to mitigate the vagaries of short-term contracts or more 
cyclical industries. Furthermore, the Group addresses these risks 
by investing in assets operating in stable economies and/or 
established markets or sectors with strong legal protections.
Business Risk
The YTL Power Group’s principal activities are subject to certain 
risks inherent in their respective sectors. These may include 
shortages of labour and raw materials, increases in the cost of 
labour, raw materials, equipment and electricity tariffs, changes in 
the general economic, business, credit and interest rate conditions, 
inflation, taxation and changes in the legal and environmental 
framework within which the industries operate.
The Group addresses these matters by maintaining sound financial 
risk management policies as set out above, and high standards of 
preventive maintenance and cost efficiency coupled with technical 
and operating efficiency of its assets.
Dependence on Key Management
The continued success of YTL Power is, to a significant extent, 
dependent on the abilities and continued efforts of the Board and 
senior management of YTL Power. Key personnel a with strong 
background in the diversified areas of YTL Power’s principal 
activities are valuable assets to YTL Power. The loss of any key 
member of the Board or senior management personnel could affect 
YTL Power’s ability to compete in the sectors in which it operates. 
The future success of YTL Power also depends on its ability to 
attract and retain skilled personnel for smooth business operations 
of the Group to continue without undue disruption. Therefore, 
appropriate measures are taken which include the provision of 
training programmes, the offering of attractive incentives such as 
employees’ share option schemes and competitive remuneration 
packages, and efforts to ensure smooth succession in the 
management team.
Political, Economic & Regulatory Risks
Like all other businesses, adverse developments in political, 
economic and regulatory conditions in Malaysia, Singapore, the 
UK, Indonesia, Jordan and other overseas markets in which the 
Group from time to time has operations or investments could 
materially and adversely affect the financial and business 
prospects of the Group and the markets for its products and/or 
services. 
Whilst it is not possible to prevent the occurrence of these 
events, the Group attempts to mitigate the effects of these risks 
through thorough due diligence assessments prior to the 
commitment to any project, ensuring compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations, as well as its strategy of maintaining the 
geographic diversity of its operations, and remaining vigilant in 
monitoring events and conducting ongoing assessments of any 
operational and financial impacts of such external developments.

Environmental & Climate-Related Risks
The YTL Power Group’s businesses, and in particular its utilities, 
are likely to continue to be subject to environmental legislation 
and regulations, compliance with which could result in increased 
costs, or losses of or reductions in revenue, to the Group. The 
terms on which concessions for power and other utilities projects 
are granted by relevant regulatory authorities may include, on 
occasion, requirements to contribute to environmental and/or 
other public works. 
The YTL Power Group’s businesses are exposed to environmental 
and climate-related risks including transition risks, which may 
arise from legal, regulatory, policy, technological and market 
changes to address climate mitigation and adaptation, and 
physical risks resulting from climate change which may arise from 
extreme weather events or longer-term shifts in weather 
patterns, causing adverse impacts including operational disruptions 
and physical damage to assets. 
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that its 
businesses are viable and sustainable on a long-term basis. In the 
short term, the Group will continue to monitor, manage and offset 
its carbon emissions and optimise resource management, and 
take guidance from domestic and international policies to keep 
abreast of developments in climate change and environmental 
issues. Over the medium to longer term, the Group will continue 
to incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities into its 
business model, operations and engagements with various 
stakeholders. 
Further information on the Group’s actions in managing these 
matters can be found in the Environmental, Social & Governance 
Report 2023 in this Annual Report.

OUTLOOK
Global economic growth is projected to decelerate in 2023, 
reflecting the challenging and uncertain economic environment. 
The outlook for global growth is tilted to the downside, with risks 
including increased geopolitical fragmentation, higher-than-
expected inflation and a sharp tightening in global financial 
market conditions, including further stress in the banking sector 
(source: Bank Negara Malaysia updates) .
Looking ahead, YTL PowerSeraya will continue to focus on 
customer service, operational efficiency and exploring 
diversification beyond the core business into integrated multi-
utilities supply. Electricity is an essential service and demand in 
Singapore is expected to remain stable. 
Wessex Water will continue to work towards delivering the 
investment commitments agreed with Ofwat, as it progresses 
with development of the business plan for the next price review 
for the forthcoming 2025-2030 period. Outside of the regulated 
business, exploration is also ongoing of low-risk opportunities for 
organic growth within Wessex Water’s wider UK operations.
The outlook for the Group’s main operations in Malaysia remains 
stable. YTL Comms is well-positioned to continue to grow its 
subscriber base as the first mover in delivering innovative 5G 
services to its customers, offering highly affordable data plans, as 
well as successful collaborations. 
YTL Power will continue to advance its sustainability transition, 
particularly with the development of its 500 MW solar farm 
project, YTL Green Data Center Park and partnerships in clean 
energy solutions and green technologies.

(“FY”) ended 30 June 2023 (“FY2023”), unless otherwise specified, 
and where there is readily available data.
There was one change to the Group’s reporting segments during the 
financial year under review with the Multi Utilities Business (Merchant) 
segment now reported under the Power Generation segment.
The environmental data in this report covers YTL Power and the 
operating subsidiaries which contributed to approximately 96% of our

MATERIALITY
Due to the essential nature of the utility services that our Group provides, our key stakeholders encompass a broad range of groups 
across our operations. These include our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, investors, lenders, business partners, industry 
groups, local communities, regulators and governments in the countries where we operate.
In carrying out this exercise, we reference the GRI reporting principles and guidance. We conduct materiality assessment exercises to 
help us identify the economic, environmental, social and governance issues that matter most to our business and our stakeholders. The 
assessment takes into account various factors including our business priorities, stakeholder feedback and the UN SDGs. Our material 
matters are reviewed and assessed annually as necessary to ensure their continued relevance.

Understanding the Context of our Material Matters
Whilst our Group operates in countries across the globe, the individual businesses are highly localised, with each key business segment 
generally operating in a single jurisdiction, area or region. As such, the materiality of ESG concerns, impacts and initiatives differs across 
business segments depending on their nature, and we then have a high-level Group-wide consolidation process to measure these 
matters.
Therefore, the matters that are material to our water and sewerage business in the UK will differ from those that affect our power 
generation business in Singapore or our telecommunications business in Malaysia. The following table provides an overview to further 
explain this in the context of our Group and the focus of disclosures in our ESG Report.

Management of our Material Matters
Value creation by the YTL Power Group is intrinsically linked to our ESG strategy, risks and opportunities, and our alignment with the 
relevant UN SDGs. Our risk framework is identified and managed through a tiered system of groups drawn from operational staff, senior 
management, Executive Directors and the Board. The Board reviews and is ultimately responsible for risk and setting the risk appetite 
and tolerance.
Risks have been identified evaluated and managed in line with our processes throughout the year. This section narrows the focus to 
highlight the ESG context, which forms a subset of our risk management framework, further details of which can be found in the 
Management Discussion & Analysis and Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control in this Annual Report.

MANAGING SUSTAINABILITY

---- Page 46 ----
Protection of the environment remains one of our core tenets 
and we place an important part of our focus on sustainable 
development.
YTL Power is dedicated to progressing in a sustainable manner 
whilst taking precautionary approaches to minimise the potential 
risks to both our business and the environment, in accordance 
with the UN SDG principles relating to the environment. We strive 
to minimise our environmental impacts through our collective 
efforts in the areas of climate change and energy, waste and 
water management, resource management and biodiversity.
We have set a high-level target for our Group to be carbon 
neutral in operations by 2050, in line with the Malaysian 
Government’s goal. Given the diverse geographic location of our 
Group’s key businesses, some of our operations have already 
moved ahead, in line with technological advances, government 
incentives and regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions, and 
are expected to reach this goal sooner:
✓ In the UK, Wessex Water’s target is to achieve net zero 
operational carbon emissions by 2030 and net zero 
total carbon emissions (including supply chain) by 
2040.
✓ In Singapore, YTL PowerSeraya is targeting a 60% reduction 
in GHG emissions (Scope 1) by 2030 (from 2010 levels), 
with a net zero ambition by 2050.
We recognise that the planet provides limited resources and as 
such the onus is on us to mitigate impacts on land, water and air 
through the responsible use of natural resources and sustainable 
operations. 
Our commitment
Protecting and improving the environment to build a better 
future
Our approach
We are dedicated to providing high quality services and 
products whilst minimising our impacts on the environment. 
We recognise the adverse impacts of environmental 
degradation and climate change, and strive to pursue 
purposeful measures in ensuring our businesses are 
genuinely sustainable and in compliance with legal 
environmental requirements. We contribute towards this 
cause through the following activities:
✓ Reducing GHG emissions
✓ Promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy
✓ Improving water efficiency
✓ Managing waste streams and ensuring responsible 
disposal or reuse
✓ Optimising resource efficiency
✓ Conserving terrestrial and marine biodiversity and 
ecosystems

Strategic investment in protection of the environment has 
resulted in a growing portfolio of green investments, environmental 
technologies, GHG emission reduction measures, resource 
efficiency programmes and biodiversity conservation programmes 
across our Group. We are committed to the pursuit of new 
ventures, particularly in renewable and sustainable energy 
solutions, with a view to achieving our target as early as possible. 
This will be propelled by our key operations in the UK and 
Singapore, which are further along on this journey, driven by the 
climate progress being pursued in those countries.
YTL PowerSeraya’s 60-30 Vision
YTL PowerSeraya’s 60-30 Vision is its goal to achieve a 60% 
reduction in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2010 levels by 2030, 
which it aims to fulfil through the following actions:
(i)
 Maximise energy efficiencies of its existing power plants and 
reduce 
emissions intensity by at least 10% from 2020 level 
by 2030 
(ii)
 Invest in low carbon power technologies such as hydrogen-
ready 
power plants 
(iii) Diversify energy sources by importing low carbon or green
 
electricity 
(iv) Secure eligible high-quality international carbon credits to
 
offset at least 5% of its taxable emissions by 2030 
Wessex Water’s Routemap to Net Zero Carbon
In 2020, water companies in England produced a routemap to 
achieving net zero operational carbon emissions by 2030. This 
was the first sector routemap of its kind in the world, and Wessex 
Water published its own detailed plan in mid-2021 to achieve net 
zero operational carbon emissions by 2030, alongside a goal to 
achieve full de-carbonisation by 2040, a decade ahead of the UK 
government’s 2050 target. The 2030 aim is not a science-based 
target, but we consider it to be aligned with the principles of the 
Paris Agreement and the United Nations Convention on Climate 
Change 1.5°C pathway.
The plan has three strands:
(i) Emissions avoidance e.g. further reducing leakage and
 
encouraging water efficiency, use of lower carbon transport 
and promotion of low energy, nature-based solutions;
(ii)
 Optimisation measures e.g. improving energy efficiency and 
controlling 
process emissions; and
(iii) More renewable energy e.g. increasing generation from
 
biogas and pursuing new opportunities for wind and solar 
power, both as generator and end user.

CLIMATE & ENERGY
In line with our commitment to SDG 13 (Climate Action), YTL 
Power strives to assess and mitigate climate-related risks 
stemming from tougher climate regulations and higher carbon 
prices, and continuously updates efforts to reduce, mitigate and 
adapt to the effects of climate change. Our strategy remains 
focused on reducing emissions, enhancing energy efficiency and 
adopting renewable energy technologies towards a low carbon 
future.
GHG Emissions
Recognising climate change as a significant risk that needs to be 
managed carefully, we measure and report our GHG emissions to 
develop a coherent climate strategy centered on various nature-
based solutions as well as community-based adaptation plans and 
initiatives in our various business units.
Our investment strategy has expanded to encompass new 
business models and green technology that focuses on energy 
efficiency, digitisation, resource recovery and cleaner energy 
solutions for a low carbon and climate resilient transition.
Type Description
Scope 1 Direct emissions from the consumption of fossil 
fuels in operations as well as company-owned or 
operated vehicles and refrigerant use
Scope 2 Indirect emissions from purchased/grid electricity 
consumption
Scope 3 Other indirect emissions from supply chain, such as 
business travel, outsourced activities, purchased 
electricity and fuels, treatment chemicals and reuse 
of biosolids on third party land
This year, we registered total Scope 1 GHG emissions of 3,921 
kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO₂e), a 5% increase 
compared to 3,718 ktCO₂e last year. The increase was due mainly 
to higher power generation in Singapore, which rose 13% for the 
financial year under review to 10,040 GWh.
Scope 2 emissions increased to 150 ktCO₂e this year compared to 
118 ktCO₂e last year, with the increase due mainly to an increase 
in the number of base stations in the telecommunications segment.
However, our GHG intensity decreased 13% to 0.19 this year 
compared to 0.22 last year, based on our Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions, measured against revenue.

 This 
is a first-time disclosure for the current financial year under review
Emission factors used for calculation of GHG emissions above are 
sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), Malaysian Green Technology Corporation, Energy Market 
Authority (EMA) Singapore, the UK Department for Environment, 
Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the UK Department for Energy 
Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and research commissioned by UK 
Water Industry Research. Main GHGs comprise carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide and refrigerants from our water and 
sewerage and telecommunications businesses based on the 
nature of their operations, as well as carbon dioxide from our 
power generation segment as other emissions are negligible.
In the UK, Wessex Water’s trajectory of diminishing annual gross 
GHG emissions continued in 2022-23, falling to the lowest annual 
operational carbon footprint since reporting began in 1997. A 
combination of energy efficiency improvements, renewable 
energy generation and the rapidly falling carbon dioxide intensity 
of UK grid electricity has led to steadily falling emissions over the 
last seven years.
Power Generation Mix
In Singapore, we continuously seek to source clean energy options 
to deliver affordable electricity to customers. Substantially all the 
power generated by YTL PowerSeraya comes from natural gas, 
which is amongst the least carbon intensive fossil fuels 
commercially available.

Advancing towards a more sustainable future, YTL PowerSeraya 
is also exploring low carbon hydrogen prototyping and feasibility 
studies separately with research institutions and key hydrogen 
partners in an effort to improve energy efficiency and ‘green’ 
power generation sustainability.
Energy options in Singapore are currently, by and large, limited to 
fossil-based fuels owing to the country’s geographic characteristics 
and constraints. As a major power sector player in Singapore’s 
open electricity market, YTL PowerSeraya has an important role in 
providing reliable and energy efficient electricity to power the 
country’s economy while contributing to the Singapore 2030 
climate change goals.
Taking guidance from Singapore’s blueprint, YTL PowerSeraya will 
develop a long-term de-carbonisation strategy that will transform 
its brownfield assets through low carbon fuel shifts, conversion 
of existing combined cycle gas turbines to hydrogen-ready power 
plants and hybridisation of power generation with renewable 
energy sources generated locally and overseas, as well as 
deployment of various energy storage solutions to advance its 
net zero ambition by 2050.
Renewable Energy
Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, producing 
much lower negative environmental and social impacts than 
conventional fossil fuel-based energy. In support of the transition to 
a low carbon economy, YTL Power has implemented various 
renewable energy integration projects across our business units and 
promoted the generation and use of renewable energy to facilitate 
the transition process and minimise our environmental footprint.
In line with our shift towards more sustainable renewable energy 
solutions, we are developing a solar power facility with a 
generation capacity of up to 500 MW in Johor, Malaysia.
This year, 12% of Wessex Water’s electricity demand came from 
renewable electricity generated at its sites. Furthermore, 
biomethane exported by Wessex Water to the gas grid was 2.5 
times the natural gas that it consumed itself. Biogas comes from 
anaerobic digestion of organic matter (sewage sludge and food 
waste), whilst biomethane comes from “upgrading” biogas 
(removal of CO2, hydrogen, etc).
Following the successful launch of Singapore’s First-and-Only 
customisable green add-on (Renewable Energy Certificate or 
Carbon Credits) for an electricity plan, YTL PowerSeraya’s retail 
arm, Geneco, expanded Power Eco Add-on’s availability from new 
sign-ups and renewals to all of its residential customers, at any 
point of their contracts, on 1 April 2023.
With this expansion, existing Power Eco Add-on customers are 
able to upgrade their current add-ons via Geneco’s self-service 
portal and mobile app. As at 30 June 2023, 3,408 customers had 
opted for Power Eco Add-on. This 2.0 initiative is in line with 
Geneco’s commitment to supporting the Singapore Green Plan 
2030 and building a more sustainable future for the nation by 
encouraging its customers to do their part for the environment.

Green Financing
We embarked on new green financing initiatives this year, a first 
for our Group.
The YTL Green Data Center Park in Kulai, Johor, Malaysia’s first 
data center campus to be co-powered by on-site renewable solar 
energy, is one of our new digital transformation businesses. This 
year, we undertook a RM1.1 billion Islamic term financing facility 
for Phase 1, with a commitment to secure Gold LEED certification 
in compliance with Green Loan Principles published by the Loan 
Market Association, Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and Loan 
Syndications and Trading Association.
Integrated with on-site solar photovoltaic power, the YTL Green 
Data Center Park aims to provide data storage colocation services 
to clients looking for more sustainable and lower carbon solutions 
within Southeast Asia and serves as the foundation for achieving 
YTL Power’s greater objective of carbon neutrality for its data 
centers across the region.
Meanwhile, the Wessex Group’s Sustainable Financing Framework, 
which supports its financing ambitions to deliver tangible 
environmental and social benefits, is now in place. The framework 
aligns Wessex Water’s purpose – to support customers’ health and 
well-being and enhance the environment and the diverse 
communities it serves – and its business plan commitments to its 
financing ambitions through targeted financing.
Under the framework, the Wessex Group may issue environmental 
or social debt instruments to support its environmental and social 
objectives, enabling investors to participate in the provision of a 
sustainable future. Through a Sustainable Finance Framework to 
finance its plans, investors will be able to monitor how the 
funding supports delivery of Wessex Water’s sustainability goals.
The Wessex Group launched an inaugural £300 million 
sustainability bond in March 2023, re-opening the sterling primary 
markets following recent financial sector volatility. The strong 
execution dynamics on show demonstrate the willingness of the 
UK investor base to look through the current financial environment 
for names which are more insulated from the financial sector 
volatility.
WATER EFFICIENCY
Water scarcity is one of the key challenges the world faces in the 
21st century. The degree of water scarcity can differ dramatically 
from one place to another, in some cases causing wide-reaching 
damage, including to public health, economic development and 
global trade.
Across our operations, our sources of water withdrawal consist of 
municipal water supply, NEWater (reclaimed water (in Singapore)) 
and seawater. We use water in our power plants for cooling 
processes and equipment. Our offices and other businesses use 
water for drinking, cleaning, landscaping and other general 
purposes.
All trade effluent from our operations is treated and discharged to 
water courses or sewer systems in accordance with the 
environmental discharge limits and effluent standards in countries 
where we operate.

The marginal increase in water discharge was due to higher 
rainfall in England, which has led to more water being treated and 
discharged in our water and sewerage business.
Notwithstanding this, the consequences of climate change were 
clearly demonstrated during last year, which was one of the driest 
on record in the UK. Wessex Water implemented its well-rehearsed 
drought plans during the summer and succeeded in avoiding any 
restrictions to supply – maintaining its 47-year unbroken record 
of no restrictions. But to keep pace with the changing climate, the 
division will continue its drive to further reduce leakage, and work 
with customers to help them use less water, as well as planning 
for additional water storage for the longer term.

Sustainable Abstraction
Water security is a critical part of our water and sewerage 
business. We are committed to providing a better environment for 
nature and people, and Wessex Water has a vital role to play in 
helping the UK to achieve its net zero target and tackle the 
climate and nature emergencies the world is facing. Wessex 
Water’s rivers need looking after more than ever and chalk 
streams and other water sources need to be maintained in good 
health.
This year, Wessex Water was 97% compliant with the licences 
that control how much water the business can take from the 
environment.
The unprecedented heat of 2022, combined with the second 
driest year on record in the region, made for the most challenging 
conditions faced since 1976. Demand soared as reservoir and 
groundwater levels plummeted and drought followed. Wessex 
Water coped successfully with these extreme conditions, 
maintaining supplies to all customers, avoiding any usage 
restrictions, and maintaining flow support to several vulnerable 
streams and rivers. Unplanned outage decreased to 0.76% in 
2022-2023, compared to 1.59% the previous year, and is well 
within the target of 2.34%. 
Wessex Water also remains on track for its three-year average 
leakage target, despite 2022 being a difficult year due to both the 
extreme heat-drought in the summer and a significant freeze-
thaw event in the winter.
Last year was a milestone year for water resource planning. 
Wessex Water published its new draft Water Resources 
Management Plan in the autumn, as well as playing its part with 
neighbouring water companies, in producing the first ever regional 
plan in January 2023, as part of the West Country Water Resources 
Group. Further details on the Draft Water Resource Management 
Plan can be found in the ‘ESG’ section on our website.
Environmental Water Quality
All effluent from our operations is treated and discharged to 
water courses or sewer systems is in accordance with the 
environmental discharge limits and effluent standards in countries 
where we operate. We have consistently achieved very high 
compliance with water discharge quality under local standards 
and there were no significant chemical or oil spills during the 
reporting period.
Water discharge compliance from Wessex Water’s water treatment 
and water recycling centres remained very high at 99.4%.  
This was below the 100% target with two sites failing in the 
year, and process improvements have been implemented to 
restore and maintain compliance at the specific sites.
Responding to wider public concern in the UK, Wessex Water has 
committed to eliminating all storm overflow discharges by 2050. 
The number of hours of storm overflows discharged this year fell 
by 45% – from 238,049 hours in 2020 to 129,957 in 2022. This 
was despite a 27% increase in monitor coverage and largely 
because of the dry weather. Wessex Water reported operational 
data from 91% of 1,300 overflows, and 100% will be monitored 
by the end of 2023.
Storm overflows are the legacy of over 100 years, when sewerage 
systems were built using the same pipe to carry both sewage and 
rainwater, with overflows designed to protect property from 
flooding during very heavy rain. Wessex Water has 1,300 overflows 
on 35,089 kilometres of sewers and has been steadily eliminating 
or improving these.
Wessex Water has already increased investment and is currently 
spending £3 million per month – at no additional cost to customers 
– to make a 25% reduction in the operation of storm overflows by 
2025, from the 2020 level. After 2025, Wessex Water is proposing 
a threefold increase in investment to £9 million per month, with 
the aim of fully treating or eliminating any discharge from storm 
overflows by 2050. The solutions chosen must also be sustainable 
for the long-term, taking into account the impact of climate 
change. So, wherever possible, surface water will be separated 
from sewage flows or nature-based treatment solutions will be 
used.
As part of the work to reduce the number of overflows, 93 
improvement projects are currently in progress and many more to 
come. Further details on the Storm Overflows Improvement Plan 
can be found in the ‘ESG’ section on our website.
In May 2023, Wessex Water published its Drainage and Wastewater 
Management Plan (DWMP), providing a strategic long-term plan 
for the network. The DWMP identifies how Wessex Water will 
extend, improve and maintain a robust and resilient drainage and 
wastewater system in light of the pressures of climate change, 
population growth and growing customer expectations.

Climate change also means lower flows for longer periods in many 
of the rivers and watercourses within Wessex Water’s operating 
region. This, coupled with a growing population and new houses, 
means that the level of nutrients is too high, resulting in excessive 
growth of algae and consequent damage to the water 
environment. Because of this, Natural England is imposing tough 
new standards for the level of nutrients and requiring any new 
development to be nutrient-neutral. The new standards will 
affect almost half the Wessex Water region and will be the 
largest driver of its investment programme from 2025.
Meanwhile, at YTL PowerSeraya’s Pulau Seraya and Taser power 
stations, wastewater after undergoing power plant processes is 
discharged to the open sea. This wastewater discharge, which is 
within the environmental limits regulated under the Environmental 
Protection and Management (Trade Effluent) Regulations of 
Singapore, is about 24.9% of the total water withdrawn.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Energy Efficiency
We manage and monitor our energy consumption and efficiency 
to implement the appropriate energy management practices in 
our daily operations. We have implemented several initiatives to 
reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and progressively 
upgrade our existing infrastructure with energy saving features 
across YTL Power’s operations and properties.
2023 2022 2021
Total fuel consumption 
(terajoules) 76,491 64,213 57,249
– Natural gas 99.5% 94.1% 99.5%
– Others 0.5% 5.9% 0.5%
Grid & house load energy 
consumption (GWh) 606 581 567
In the UK, Wessex Water’s electricity use, at 254 gigawatt hours, 
was relatively low in the context of the last five years, in part due 
to the dry summer, but close to its average consumption over the 
last 10 to 15 years. Wessex Water continues to pursue energy 
efficiency opportunities to offset any rising energy use driven by 
tighter water and sewage treatment standards, and the operation 
of the regional water supply grid.
Besides embarking on upstream low carbon energy solutions,  
YTL PowerSeraya is committed to supporting carbon abatement 
initiatives and providing low carbon electricity to end-users in 
Singapore.
In line with Singapore’s objective to deploy 12,000 electric vehicle 
chargers at public housing estates’ carparks by 2025, a joint 
venture company ChargEco was formed in November 2022 
between YTL PowerSeraya and Strides Mobility, a leading mobility 
solutions and services provider and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
SMRT Corporation Ltd, to install, operate and maintain 1,200 EV 
chargers in Singapore.
As at 30 June 2023, ChargEco had successfully installed over  
39 EV chargers in 13 carparks in Singapore’s Central and East 
regions. Besides providing electrification solutions to public 
housing estates, ChargEco is also actively pursuing opportunities 
in private, commercial and industrial estates.

Echoing the UN’s calls for “everything, everywhere all at once” to 
combat climate change, we are also pursuing upstream 
decarbonisation efforts by developing clean energy solutions and 
actively sourcing for low carbon electricity imports. The Group will 
also unlock downstream opportunities through sustainable 
electrification and carbon abatement solutions.
At our Brabazon development in Bristol, health and well-being are 
strongly supported. Segregated cycle paths and walking routes 
are designed to encourage active travel across 15-minute 
neighbourhoods, while gyms and wellness spaces will provide 
plenty of opportunity for an active lifestyle. Picture windows that 
flood the homes with natural light are a key feature, as well as 
clever layouts and a range of sustainable features that are all 
included as standard. Our emphasis on sustainability means that 
the second phase of new homes exclude gas-based heating 
entirely. Instead, heating will be provided through air source heat 
pumps, reducing reliance on natural resources.
The plans for the new phase – created by award-winning local 
architects Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios – aim to foster a strong 
sense of community. The new homes are designed on a network 
of “living streets”, with residents able to enjoy expanded access 
to outdoor spaces that bring people together, including shared 
gardens, public squares and play areas for children. Landed homes 
come equipped with solar panels and all residents will have access 
to EV charging bays.
Brabazon is a brownfield site, redeveloping the old Filton Airfield 
into a vibrant new community. Apart from rehabilitating and 
rejuvenating existing buildings such as the hangars, the airfield 
runways are processed and repurposed on-site. There is an 
established soil management plan where on-site soil is treated 
and reused throughout the site. Strict governance through on-
site monitoring ensures construction material packaging and 
waste is sorted on-site to increase recycling.
Waste Management
Waste generation around the world has increased exponentially 
over the last few decades, due to factors including population 
growth, urbanisation and economic growth, as well as online 
shopping and consumerism generally combined with inefficient 
waste management systems.
We work towards ensuring efficient resource use and responsible 
disposal in our organisation and continuously look for ways to 
avoid unnecessary consumption and waste generation, exploring 
innovative opportunities and partnerships. We engage licensed 
third-party contractors across our operations to handle hazardous 
waste, storage and responsible disposal, adhering to best practices 
and local regulatory requirements.

In 2022, Wessex Water completed the installation of 24 new 
drinking water refill units across the region. The units are well 
used, providing free water and preventing more than 245,000 
single-use plastic bottles going to landfill every year. Free drinking 
water at local sporting events was also provided again. Wessex 
Water provided water stations at runs across the region, including 
Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life and the Bath Half Marathon, 
hydrating over 16,000 athletes and eliminating more than 20,000 
single-use plastic bottles from landfill.
Responsible Production & Consumption
We place a high priority on responsible production and community-
wide initiatives to encourage and assist our customers and their 
local communities in protecting their shared environment and 
resources.
Wessex Water is proud, particularly given altered water 
consumption patterns since Covid, to have exceeded its 
performance commitment target for the volume of water saved 
through water efficiency activities, delivering savings of 3.6 Ml/d 
compared to an end of year target of 3.0 Ml/d.
Wessex Water’s water efficiency promotions were very popular 
with customers who were motivated by the twin pressures of 
drought and high energy prices, which are relevant to hot water 
use. The division re-launched its Home Check service to install 
water saving devices and offer bespoke behavioural advice to 
customers in their homes in April 2022. By the end of the year, 
Wessex Water had visited 4,439 customers and plumbers returned 
to 750 of these to fix leaking toilets and taps.

Wessex Water also promoted its free water saving device pack 
through social media and in e-newsletters and distributed more 
than 18,000 packs during the year, including nearly 11,500 eco 
shower heads. More than 21,000 households also signed up to 
use the online GetWaterFit water use calculator, up from 14,000 
the previous year.
In August 2022, the division launched a new non-household 
water efficiency programme, targeting schools for device 
installations and leak fixes – supporting 91 schools by the end of 
March 2023.
Following the successful launch of Singapore’s First-and-Only 
customisable green add-on (Renewable Energy Certificate or 
Carbon Credits) for an electricity plan, Geneco has expanded 
Power Eco Add-on’s availability from new sign-ups and renewals 
to all of its residential customers, at any point of their contracts, 
on 1 April 2023. As of 30 June 2023, Geneco had 3,408 customers 
who have opted for Power Eco Add-on.
BIODIVERSITY
Based on our Group’s operational footprint, protection of 
biodiversity is of material importance in Wessex Water’s 
operational sphere which covers over 10,000 square kilometres in 
the south west of England and our Brabazon development in 
Bristol, whilst our activities in Malaysia and Singapore do not have 
significant impacts on biodiversity.
Wessex Water’s work to boost biodiversity on its landholdings 
continues well and work for the year drew on insights derived 
from the 2021 baseline biodiversity value assessment. Wessex 
Water has identified that its 333 larger sites, each of more than 
0.5 hectares, contribute the lion’s share of its biodiversity units 
(13,952), whereas 1,825 small sites contribute far fewer (395). 
Some individual sites make an enormous contribution, including 
Clatworthy Reservoir (13.5%), Charmy and Shapwick Heath (10%).
Wessex Water has agreed actions with Natural England to improve 
a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the 
region. It exceeded the target number of actions to be delivered 
by 2022-23.
Of its SSSI landholding, 63% is in favourable condition and 30% 
is classified as unfavourable – recovering, a total of 93%. This is 
unchanged from last year. Work is also ongoing towards the UK 
government’s 25-Year Environment Plan target to restore 75% of 
protected sites to favourable condition.
Wessex Water’s Biodiversity Action Plan (Spring 2023 Update) can 
be found in the ‘ESG’ section of our website, together with more 
information on current biodiversity partnerships.
Meanwhile, we received planning approval in November 2022  
for Brabazon Park, a 15-acre public park at the center of our 
Brabazon development in Bristol. Wildlife corridors are designed 
into our Masterplan, providing protected passage and contributing 
to the biodiversity net gain. These corridors are intertwined with 
the 15-acre Brabazon Park, a new landmark in the south west of 
England at the heart of the development.
The design of Brabazon Park takes inspiration from aviation 
engineering, aiming to capture the historical, cultural and 
ecological uniqueness of the former airfield. One of the highlights 
of the new green space will be the Heritage Trail, connecting the 
Brabazon Hangars with Aerospace Bristol Museum and retelling 
the history of the airfields pioneering past.
Brabazon Park will also support the environment, offering new 
habitats for birds, insects and animals, while also connecting to 
other local wildlife corridors. There will be flowers and grasses, 
mature trees and shrubs, as well as the 3-acre lake, which will be 
a home for aquatic planting and will support sustainable drainage 
across the new neighbourhood. The lake is part of the masterplan 
water attenuation strategy which replaces the need to construct 
holding tanks.

Customer Satisfaction
We manage customer engagement from the ground-up in order 
to cater to and address the specific needs of different groups of 
customers. Our teams on the ground at the local level regularly 
engage with customers, soliciting and reviewing their feedback on

their experience with us.
Singapore’s open electricity market makes it easy for customers 
to choose their electricity provider, which incentivises electricity 
retailers to come up with attractive, innovative plans that address 
the needs of their customers. Rising awareness of the need to 
address climate change and the unique geographic and resource-
related challenges Singapore faces have increased customer 
interest in more energy efficient solutions that would enable 
them to mitigate their carbon impacts.
Last year, YTL PowerSeraya’s retail brand, Geneco, introduced the 
Power Eco Add-on plan to cater to the growing demand for 
greener electricity. The plan offers eco-conscious customers the 
option of choosing either carbon credits or Renewable Energy 
Certificates (RECs) to lower the carbon footprint of their electricity 
consumption. This year, availability of the plan, which was 
previously available for new sign-ups and renewals, was extended 
to all residential customers, at any point of their contracts.
In 2022, Wessex Water again delivered very strong performance 
in the UK water sector’s customer satisfaction metric (C-MeX) 
coming third overall. This was in part a product of its dedicated 
Customer Experience Group, continually reviewing C-MeX 
performance and feedback from customers in order to drive 
continuous improvement.
In addition, 87% of customers said they are satisfied with the 
service. This is a slight fall from 2021 (92%) but remains very high 
given that extreme weather affected response times and there 
was negative media coverage about the wider water sector in the 
year. 79% of customers said the division’s service was good or 
very good value for money; a higher proportion than in 2021 but 
still below target. Wessex Water’s average Trustpilot rating for 
2022 was 4.6 stars out of 5, and 86% of reviewers gave the top 
possible rating of five stars.
This year, Wessex Water again received the Customer Service 
Excellence award and retained the Service Mark with distinction 
from the Institute of Customer Service, one of only 20 companies

In Malaysia, YTL Comms continued to build on the roll-out of its 
5G services in tandem with the expansion of Digital Nasional 
Berhad’s network. We have long led the way in democratising 
access to high-speed mobile broadband services, offering the 
most affordable plans and bridging the access divide across rural 
and urban areas of the Peninsula.
This year, YTL Comms received several awards for its customer-
centric approach including ‘Best in Consumer Satisfaction’, ‘Best 
Quality of Service’, ‘Best in Corporate Social Responsibility’ and 
‘Best Mobile Network Operator with Less Than 5 Million

Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances
We offer financial assistance and other support programmes 
across our operations intended to assist customers facing difficult 
or challenging circumstances. As part of the YTL Group, YTL 
Power also contributes significantly to YTL Foundation, the YTL 
Group’s charitable arm, responsible for delivering the YTL Group’s 
community improvement initiatives.
This has been a tough year for many of our customers in the UK, 
with extremely high energy prices and food bills fuelled by high 
inflation. As a provider of an essential service, Wessex Water 
made it a priority to mobilise support for customers and 
communities who needed it most by expanding its industry-
leading tailored assistance programme (tap) of affordability help, 
making it easier and quicker for customers to access the help they 
need.
Customers are also offered extensive financial and debt support 
through a range of schemes and low-rate tariffs under tap. This 
increased in 2022 as customer incomes were increasingly 
squeezed by inflation and the high cost of living. Wessex Water is 
tripling the numbers on its financial support schemes over the 
next couple of years, making help much easier and quicker to 
access, auto-enrolling customers on to discounted tariffs where it 
can, and injecting additional funding into the debt advice sector to 
build extra capacity.
Wessex Water made the following changes in the past year:
✓ W orked to fast track up to another 60,000 customers on to 
its Assist social tariff, to benefit from discounts of up to 90% 
on their water bills more quickly and easily
✓ Worked with the UK Department of Work and Pensions to  
automatically apply a 20% discount to the bills of up to 
55,000 low-income pensioners. Overall, more than 23,900 
low-income pensioners received around £60 off their bill
✓ Set up data shares with local councils to auto-enroll customers 
on to help schemes
✓ Promoted its schemes using a variety of communication  
channels, and using imagery and wording customers have said 
will best encourage them to get in touch. Wessex Water also 
built new partnerships with organisations to increase take-up
✓ Simplified the application process for its schemes based on  
feedback from customers through focus groups
✓ Injected an additional £160,000 from out-performance into  
the debt advice sector, funding seven new projects across its 
region to directly increase capacity
✓ Ran a large pilot with debt advice organisation Money Wellness 
to directly refer customers to them through a web portal. With 
consent, Wessex Water 
is also able to receive customer data 
in return and support them with the right scheme
Wessex Water greatly values the insights of around 300 partners 
who help support vulnerable customers, and are always looking at 
ways to work more effectively with them and to develop new 
relationships. The division is co-funding a project with Bristol 
Water and two energy distribution networks for the Royal 
Association for the Deaf to signpost or register customers for 
Priority Services and/or affordability support.

Training, Development & Well-being
Nurturing and building people capabilities continued to be a top 
people agenda in FY2023. Our success is deeply rooted in the 
strength of our people, and investing in them is the key to 
achieving our collective goals.
We recognise the contributions of all employees to our collective 
achievements. In order to equip our employees with the right 
skills, we provide training, workshops and seminars on a diverse 
range of topics, including occupational health and safety, 
environmental management, environmental awareness, project 
management, technical capability and soft skill development such 
as communications, leadership and other topics.

With the acceleration of virtual learning over the past few years, 
it is easier than ever for employees to initiate and undertake their 
own training, signing up for and participating in sessions that best 
suit their specific needs and interests. Whilst this method of 
training is highly effective, tracking these training hours is largely 
done via voluntary reporting by employees and, as such, the total 
training hours captured by conventional systems may not 
accurately reflect the higher number of actual training hours 
undertaken. This is an area for ongoing analysis and improvement 
in the data collection process.
We aim to enhance the strength of mental and emotional 
connections of our people with their workplace and strive to 
create an environment where people are engaged and enabled to 
optimise performance. We view employee feedback mechanisms 
across our Group as essential in creating effective communication 
channels. During the year under review, these included the YTL 
Group Leadership Conference, in addition to a range of 
programmes carried out at subsidiary level across our Group.
To strengthen its people advantage and foster a growth mindset, 
YTL PowerSeraya ramped up its learning and development 
delivery in the year. In addition to mainstay function-specific 
technical training and Leadership Development programmes, a 
series of digital skills training to enable different levels of staff to 
thrive in today’s digital world were rolled out. These included 
Excel, Power BI and Machine Learning programmes to equip 
employees to be more proficient in analysing data in their day-to-
day tasks and for data-driven decision-making.

Our workforce of just under 4,800 people as at 30 June 2023 is 
situated mainly in the UK, Singapore and Malaysia, and we also 
have a smaller number of employees in Indonesia, the Netherlands 
and other countries.
People are our most valuable asset and we aspire to attract, 
retain and nurture people with exceptional capabilities by 
providing competitive remuneration packages, as well as investing 
in the ongoing learning and development of our human resources. 
In addition, we offer internship and apprentice programmes to 
equip future talented employees with extensive industry 
knowledge as well as hands-on experience.

As part of workforce planning and renewal, pipeline building for 
knowledge transfer and replacement of retiring employees 
continued. Over the years, YTL PowerSeraya has successfully 
adopted a multi-pronged sourcing approach leveraging internships, 
work-study programmes, scholarships, career fairs and open 
market hires to fulfil its talent needs. In the year under review, a 
new Staff Referral Scheme was launched to further enhance 
sourcing success.
Post-pandemic, YTL PowerSeraya’s ‘VIBRANCY’ club has been 
revived with on-site after-hours recreational activities such as 
board games night and happy hour. Corporate celebratory and 
get-together lunches were regularly organised for employees to 
enjoy their meals together. As part of employee well-being and 
work-life balance initiatives, guidelines on After-hours 
Communication were shared so that employees can more 
effectively disconnect from work to rest and recharge. Further, a 
new Internal Job Market Scheme was implemented to provide 
internal career opportunities and mobility for employees. These 
measures and initiatives will go a long way to enhance employee 
engagement and retention.
This year, YTL PowerSeraya led the pack in embarking on 
Operation and Technology Roadmapping in partnership with 
Singapore’s National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) under the 
Company Training Committee. The initiative involved the review 
of Terminal Operations’ end-to-end work processes to identify 
operation and technology improvement areas for focused 
development in its transformation roadmap. In the exercise, the 
competency framework for YTL PowerSeraya’s workforce will be 
updated to meet the new business requirements, and the training 
and development needs of the workforce will also be mapped out.
In the UK, in addition to welcoming 27 entry apprentices,  
21 career development apprentices, 13 people on industrial 
placements and 13 graduates in the year, Wessex Water was 
excited to launch the YTL Wessex Academy this year – a 
government recognised employer provider for apprenticeship 
delivery. The Academy will enable the delivery of high-quality 
training to be done in-house.
So far, more than 150 people have benefitted from the early 
career programmes, with an additional 35 having formal advice 
and guidance sessions on their potential career development 
steps. Wessex Water has also opened its doors to 40 work 
experience placements, showcasing career insights into the water 
industry, and has benefitted from the creation of a fantastic 
pipeline of talent to help futureproof the business.
Wessex Water delivered more than 1,000 training courses and 
added a ‘learning bites’ section to its platform to provide quick and 
simple eLearning opportunities for staff. Wessex Water expanded 
the eLearning catalogue by adding new courses to help users 
refresh knowledge quickly, including new courses for customer 
service and national water hygiene.
Labour Standards
We are committed to a strong code of conduct, professionalism 
and ethical integrity in all of our business dealings and operations. 
We ensure that the rights of our workforce are upheld and 
protected in accordance with the Employment Act 1955 in 
Malaysia and local regulations and employment acts in all 
jurisdictions where we operate.
We adhere to the YTL Group policy on Human Rights & Ethics 
encompassing child/forced labour prevention, non-discrimination, 
freedom of expression, employment rights and business ethics 
and compliance, which can be found in the ‘ESG’ section of our 
website.
As at 30 June 2023, about 83% of our workforce was based 
outside Malaysia, in countries that also have sound labour 
protection laws and standards to which we vigorously adhere. 
These include the UK, Singapore, Indonesia and the Netherlands.
We strongly oppose slavery and human trafficking in our supply 
chains and in any part of our business. To be trusted to do the 
right thing is one of our core values and we would never knowingly 
engage with suppliers or contractors involved in slavery or human 
trafficking.
Based on the nature of our operations and the stringency of our 
regulatory compliance requirements, we do not believe any of our 
business units are at risk of child labour or forced labour practices.
In Singapore, YTL PowerSeraya prides itself on having a 
harmonious and collaborative relationship with its industry union, 
the Union of Power and Gas Employees (UPAGE). In 2022, a new 
3-year Collective Agreement was successfully negotiated and 
renewed. Over the years, the division has actively partnered 
UPAGE in programmes such as education grants for members’ 
children and health screening for its employees.

Labour Movement’s mission to uplift the wages, welfare and work 
prospects of workers, the distinguished Plaque of Commendation 
(Gold) Award was conferred to YTL PowerSeraya by the NTUC Oil, 
Petrochemical, Energy and Chemical Cluster in the NTUC May Day 
Awards 2023.
Workplace Health & Safety
Protecting the health, safety and welfare of our colleagues, 
contractors and customers is a shared responsibility and we 
continue to deliver a strong health, safety and welfare culture in 
our day-to-day operations. The YTL Group policy on Health & 
Safety can be found in the ‘ESG’ section of our website.
Our aim is for zero accidents and we regularly monitor, review and 
optimise our health and safety practices to minimise incidents in 
our business operations. The information we collect assists in 
determining problem areas or emerging trends and allows 
resources to be allocated to prevent accidents or illnesses. The 
data collection and validation process is work-in-progress across 
our organisation and we target to report this information in our 
next report.
Established standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place to 
review relevant health and safety requirements to be followed in 
order to ensure health and safety risks arising from operations 
are properly managed.

YTL PowerSeraya obtained the SS 651 standard successfully and 
also initiated a 3-year safety culture transformation road map to 
promote proactive safety ownership. SS 651 is a standard 
developed specifically for the chemical industry in Singapore on 
occupational safety and health management systems. Re-
certifications of ISO45001 and BizSafeStar were also successfully 
completed during the year.
Wessex Water’s new dedicated health and safety reporting 
platform, Engage EHS, has been in place for its first full year, 
ensuring consistent reporting across the company and improving 
visibility and action management. Improvements to date included:
✓ improved safety trends and quicker response times from 
improved visibility of actions, enabling analysis of behaviours 
to inform more proactive intervention strategies.
✓ 17%  increase in employee engagement in 2022, resulting in 
an 11% increase in reported incidents, indicating a successful 
drive for openness and reporting rather than a failure, as 
injury and frequency rates both reduced. This included a 15% 
fall in serious incidents; a 9% reduction in injuries; and a 12% 
fall in all-injury frequency rate.
During the year, Wessex Water restructured and augmented its 
safety team, including implementing a multi-disciplined up-skilling 
programme for its health and safety advisers. Some of the 
division’s health and safety professionals also undertook the 
nationally recognised Kelvin TOP-SET incident investigation 
training, to improve, among other things, root cause analysis and 
prevention.
In addition to completing more than 3,000 safety audits, and a 
41% increase in site visits from senior leaders, Wessex Water also 
introduced a QR code induction process for all sites, automating 
key site-specific safety controls.
Once again, Wessex Water was very proud to receive the Royal 
Society for the Prevention of Accidents’ President’s Award, which 
is reserved for organisations which have achieved 10 or more 
consecutive gold awards. This year Wessex Water made it 11 
golds, in addition to retaining its ISO45001 certification.

Wessex Water took part in the 2022 Energy and Utility Skills 
Diversity and Inclusion Measurement Framework, which provided 
excellent insight into how it compares with the utility industry in 
the UK, including the water sector, both nationally and regionally.
While Wessex Water is making good progress on ensuring its 
workforce reflects the community it serves, its ethnicity results 
are below the UK industry average. In response, Wessex Water 
formed the Race At Work Group – an internal network of 
colleagues from across the business, to plan how it can provide 
more opportunities for those from ethnic minorities.
Similarly, Wessex Water formed a Disability Advisory Group, again 
consisting of colleagues across the business, with an interest in 
promoting opportunities for those with a disability, including 
hidden disabilities. The group will provide feedback and advice on 
improving opportunities.
After undertaking external benchmarking on its family leave 
policies, Wessex Water improved its leave and benefits 
entitlements to help attract and retain talent and build a 
reputation as an employer of choice, especially in male dominated 
business areas.
Partnerships with external organisations continued to thrive.  
For instance, Wessex Water provided work placements to help

Work Lab, and work with Seetec Plus and Bristol Future Talent

development to shape a better environment for future 
generations.
As part of the YTL Group, YTL Power also contributes significantly 
to YTL Foundation, the YTL Group’s charitable arm, responsible

Building Resilient Communities
As we adapt to the new normal and changing socio-economic 
conditions, it is now more important than ever to serve and create 
positive value for local communities. We continue to prioritise our 
commitment to building resilient communities and to improve the 
livelihoods and socio-economic well-being of local communities.
In the UK, approval is currently pending for the revised masterplan 
for Brabazon (further details of which can be found in the 
Investment Holding Activities section of the Management 
Discussion & Analysis in this Annual Report). The revised 
masterplan is designed to meet the needs of local people while 
also delivering on the objectives of the UK’s National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) and South Gloucestershire Council’s 
Local Plan. The overarching objective of the NPPF is to ensure 
development is economically, socially and environmentally 
sustainable.
As the birthplace of Concorde, the former Filton Airfield was 
known for the collective spirit of a community that changed the 
world. Brabazon is being designed to live up to that legacy, 
creating a new neighbourhood to inspire the next generation. 
Economically, the revised masterplan for Brabazon is forecasted 
to create over £5.0 billion in added economic value, with sufficient 
commercial space to support over 30,000 jobs. Socially, it 
represents a huge investment in the community that that built 
Concorde, with three new schools, a health centre, community 
facilities and over 35 hectares of new public green spaces, 
including the largest new urban park in the South West for 50 
years.
The grant of planning consent for Hangar 16U, the new local 
social hub at Brabazon, represents the second major community 
investment at Brabazon. In April 2023, YTL Developments also 
launched a new multi-year partnership with Southern Brooks to 
fund community development work and foster social cohesion 
across South Gloucestershire and North Bristol.
Southern Brooks is a community anchor charity, building 
connections and providing support to help individuals and 
communities thrive in South Gloucestershire. The new partnership 
will fund an extra community development worker and a range of 
activities for residents and community groups. Crucially, the 
partnership – worth almost £50,000 over an initial two-year 
period – is designed to engage existing local communities – from 
Bradley Stoke to Patchway, Henbury and Brentry – as well as new 
residents at Brabazon.

Under the programme, Southern Brooks will:
✓ Run neighbourhood events, from welcome workshops and  
community meetings to drop-in sessions and pop-ups
✓ Provide targeted funding for local groups, helping anything  
from book clubs to gardening groups and parenting networks 
with everyday expenses
✓ Manage newsletters and social media channels to communicate 
community information
✓ Identify and support potential community champions
✓ Southern Brooks and YTL Developments will use the Royal  
Society for Public Health Community Spirit Framework to 
measure the success and help target support where it is 
needed most
During the year, YTL Developments also launched new pathways 
into employment for local young people. This involved working 
with Bristol Talent Partnership to hold taster sessions about 
careers in property, a work experience programme for 16 year-
olds and university placement opportunities for students.
South Gloucestershire and North Bristol have needed new 
community spaces for some time. Hangar 16U, Brabazon Park and 
the new transport links at Brabazon will create ideal places for 
local residents to come together. This holistic approach to building 
sustainable communities is intended to make a real difference in 
improving social cohesion, reducing poverty, loneliness and 
isolation while boosting people’s health and well-being.
Enriching Communities through Education
Education enables upward socio-economic mobility, is key to creating a better society and has long been a priority for our Group. We 
strive to empower individuals and local communities by enhancing education and creating an inclusive and equitable environment where 
every child has access to education.
YTL Foundation believes that education moulds minds, inspires achievements, unleashes potential and is the basis on which every 
society progresses. The Foundation works towards unlocking opportunities for young Malaysians to grow, develop and reach their full 
potential.

In its dedication to the principle that all Malaysians deserve

character, the Foundation’s resources and expertise are channelled 
into a focused set of initiatives to ensure measurable and 
meaningful impact.
YTL Foundation celebrated its 25th Anniversary on 7 October 
2022 at The Majestic Hotel, Kuala Lumpur. DYMM Tuanku Muhriz

with DYMM Tuanku Muhriz ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir 
presenting awards to the top five finalists of the first-ever 
Malaysia Teacher Prize.
Highlights for FY2023 included:
(i)
 YTL Foundation Scholarship Programme
The foundation of the Scholarship Programme is the belief
 
that future generations hold the key to a prosperous and 
progressive nation. From the technical wonders of 
engineering to exploring the world of humanities, YTL 
Scholars can pursue their interests and aspirations both 
locally and internationally. Two scholarship programmes are 
available for qualifying high achievers who also possess 
strong interests in community service.
There were 15 successful YTL Foundation scholars in 2022 
including one pursuing a degree in Human, Social and Political 
Sciences in Cambridge University and another in Law in the 
University of Bristol. There are 70 active scholars under the 
programme.

elasKita: An evolution of the Learn From Home 
Initiative
With the rich bank of Learn From Home educational content, 
KelasKita allows volunteers to provide tuition (online or on-
site) to children in low-income communities most affected 
by the pandemic using the Learn From Home Lessons and 
FrogAsia’s virtual learning platform (Frog VLE). Through the 
Frog VLE, volunteers are able to teach using the ready-made 
lessons, edit lessons to add their own content, assign 
homework and quizzes and monitor the progress on their 
students.
Over the course of the year training was conducted for 
KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers Associates Sdn Bhd 
(PwC) (for both the administrators and volunteers) on using 
the KelasKita platform. In June this year, KPMG started the 
programme with students from SK Bukit Lanjan Selangor 
and PwC volunteers tutored students from Rumah Kebajikan 
Anbu Illam, Rumah Kebajikan Karunai Illam and Pusat Jagaan 
Rumah Juara.
Teach For Malaysia received a grant from CIMB Foundation 
to carry out the KelasKita classes for students in PPR Hicom 
and Lembah Subang. Volunteers from Universiti Teknologi 
MARA were recruited and trained, kicking off the first session 
in PPR Lembah Subang with 16 volunteers and 60 students. 
In April 2023, FrogAsia joined the programme and 12 
volunteers conducted classes for 80 students at PPR Hicom.
Micron Technology, an American producer of computer 
memory and computer data storage with a large facility in 
Penang also started the KelasKita programme in June this 
year with more than 70 students in two schools near their 
facility (SK Batu Kawan Penang and SJKT Batu Kawan 
Penang).
The Foundation is also working to recruit volunteers within 
the YTL Group and currently has volunteers tutoring students 
online from PPR Seri Perak in Sentul.
(iii)
 Leaps Academy
After a two-and-a-half-year hiatus due to the pandemic,
 
Leaps Academy resumed physical classes at 54C, the YTL 
Learning Space, and carried out outreach programmes 
commencing in July 2022. Leaps Academy runs programmes 
for children from the underserved community including the 
B40 and refugee communities, to improve education to build 
a stronger foundation for success.
Focus is on 3 key areas: improving academic performance, 
developing strong character through programmes that focus 
on social awareness and values, and building relationship 
with the refugee school administrators, parents and students 
to be more invested in learning.

To date, Leaps Academy has worked with over 200 local and 
international volunteers. In July 2022, three volunteer 
students from top UK universities, Bath University and 
Oxford University, were recruited through a partnership with 
Soroptimist International Damansara under their Building 
Bridges Beyond Borders programme. Serving in high-need 
refugee schools, each volunteer worked with over five 
schools and taught over 100 classes for both academic and 
non-academic subjects for a minimum of three to six months.
This was the first batch of international volunteers to

 PEMIMPIN GSL Leadership Programme for Schools
Pemimpin GSL has been supported by YTL Foundation since 
its inception in 2017. YTL Foundation has helped the
 
organisation grow and expand its reach from just 22 schools 
initially to over 1,854 schools all over Malaysia impacting 
over 3,277 school leaders and teachers and 406,200 
students.
Over the period from July 2022 to July 2023, Pemimpin GSL 
ran four programmes: - Accelerated School Leaders Initiative 
(ASLI) Cohort 1 & 2, Leadership, Enrichment and Development 
Programme Cohort 3, Leadership and Development 
Application and the Malaysia Teacher Prize.
The ASLI programme targeted at Orang Asli school leaders, 
launched last year after eight months of research, is currently 
running in Orang Asli schools in Perak, bringing impact to 30 
schools through face-to-face workshops.
Malaysia Teacher Prize – Pemimpin GSL
Together with the Global Teacher Prize and PEMIMPIN GSL, 
YTL Foundation organised and funded the first ever Malaysia 
Teacher Prize last year to elevate the status of teachers and 
recognise Malaysian teachers who go above and beyond 
their call of duty to make a difference. The inaugural event 
saw education and industry leaders coming together to 
celebrate the teaching profession and witnessed Cikgu 
Anuthra Sirisena walk away with RM50,000 for her amazing 
efforts not just in her classroom but in her community.

This year, the Malaysia Teacher Prize has returned for its 
second year to celebrate exceptional educators in Malaysia. 
In addition to YTL Foundation, the Malaysia Teacher Prize 
2023 is also funded by Yayasan Hasanah and ECM Libra 
Foundation, aspiring to reach 10,000 teachers and receive at 
least 2,000 applications. Furthermore, in November this 
year, the Prize will also feature a Summit to showcase the 
work of teachers and provide a platform for stakeholders 
within and beyond the education sphere to network and 
exchange ideas on innovations in education.
As part of the Malaysia Teacher Prize’s broader scope to 
drive long term impact for the education landscape in 
Malaysia, the Top 10 Finalists will also be given professional 
development to sharpen their expertise and scale their 
teaching methods beyond their classrooms.

 Malaysia Acumen Academy
As of June 2023, Malaysia Acumen Academy comprised 59
 
inspiring Fellows across seven states, who are leaders/key 
decision makers of their organisations. The Fellows continue 
to make a difference in Malaysia’s most pressing social 
issues such as food waste, hunger, access to healthcare, 
financial inclusion and more.
In conjunction with the launch of the 2023 cohort 
applications, Acumen Academy hosted the Acumen Academy 
Malaysia Summit at the end of July 2022. It was attended by 
150 social impact makers from various sectors who spent 
the day with Acumen Fellows and experienced parts of the 
fellowship programme during the day.
The Malaysia Acumen Academy’s new cohort was announced 
in January 2023. These dynamic individuals, who have been 
making an impact in their respective communities, will now 
embark on a leadership transformation journey which will 
prepare them for a lifetime of accompaniment and service to 
others.
(vi)  Teachers for Educational Equity Initiative 
YTL Foundation partnered with the University of Birmingham 
to 
co-develop the Teachers for Educational Equity Initiative 
– an Initiative that aims to partner with alternative learning 
centres and Teach For Malaysia to provide world-class quality 
education to teachers teaching in underserved,  
underprivileged and marginalised communities across 
Malaysia.
The Initiative includes a variety of teacher education 
programmes such as the Postgraduate Certificate in 
International Education (PGCEi in International Education), 
Postgraduate Diploma in International Education (PGDipi) 
and Master’s in Education (International Learning and 
Teaching). The Foundation and the University conducted 
desktop research and stakeholder consultations to gain 
clearer understanding of the notable challenges experienced 
by teachers in these national schools and alternative learning 
centres, from October 2022 to January 2023.
Following the research and consultations, the University 
developed a bespoke hybrid PGCEi in International Education 
which includes modules such as Teaching and Assessment, 
Adaptive Teaching and Inclusivity in Curriculum.
 
For 
the inaugural year of the PGCEi in International Education, 
the Foundation and University chose to reach out to 
alternative learning centres within the Klang Valley (Selangor, 
Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) within the Foundation’s 
network. This is to ensure a smoother execution and 
management of the programme especially as there is no 
existing framework for such a collaborative teacher education 
initiative.
A total of 36 teachers from the alternative learning centres 
and 41 from Teach For Malaysia were nominated by their 
school leaders and Teach For Malaysia, respectively. YTL 
Foundation and the University conducted the Admission 
Assessments throughout the week of 25 June 2023. The 
results of the Assessment of English Communication for 
Multilingual Speakers were announced in mid-July 2023 
followed by the registration and enrolment of the teachers 
by the University.

Supporting our Communities
We strive to build a resilient society by supporting vulnerable 
groups and giving back to local communities through charitable 
causes, partnerships and volunteerism which we believe can 
leverage our competencies to help those in our communities.
Throughout 2023 we have continued to engage with partners to 
reach wider segments of the community that would benefit from 
our programmes.

Ethical Supply Chain
We are committed to delivering world-class services whilst 
minimising any adverse health, safety and environmental impacts. 
We address our customers’ expectations and demands in each 
segment with the use of leading technology and innovative 
solutions to deliver value-added services, as well as to ensure a 
beneficial experience in conducting business with our Group.
2023
Procurement expenditure on local vendors 97%
Excellent relationships with our suppliers are key to delivering 
excellent services to our customers and nurturing business and 
innovation within our communities. We need to maintain 
relationships with suppliers who meet our high standards and 
demonstrate that they operate in accordance with recognised 
standards that uphold human rights and safety, prohibit modern 
slavery and promote sustainable sourcing.
The YTL Group policy on Commitment to Ethical Purchasing 
encompassing the areas of environmental compliance, health and 
safety and social rights and ethics can be found in the ‘ESG’ 
section of our website.
Our payment policy in respect of suppliers is to agree the payment 
terms for transactions in advance and to make payments in 
accordance with those terms. Due to the geographical and 
operational diversity of our business units, we do not follow one 
specific external code or standard on payment policy and adapt 
our practices to local standards. Our suppliers want us to provide 
them with fair, open and competitive opportunities regardless of 
their size, so that both ourselves and they can grow and excel. 
Our suppliers want fair payment terms and assistance during 
times of economic hardship, so that they can support us in 
delivering critical services to our customers.
We are fully committed to managing responsible and sustainable 
supply chains across all our businesses through the integration of 
sustainability elements into our procurement processes.
Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption Policy set out our expectations of our suppliers and 
contractors and explain our policy of zero tolerance for bribery 
and corruption within the organisation. Our policies also provide 
channels for external parties to submit any genuine whistleblowing 
reports. These are made available and easily accessible to our 
employees and the public on our website.
Measures for the promotion of responsible and ethical supply chains include:
Guidelines on supply chain 
management
• Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy
•
 Global 
Privacy Policy
•
 Code of 
Conduct & Business Ethics
•
 YTL Group policy

Our commitment
Being a trusted, reliable and financially strong corporate 
citizen
Our approach
✓ Upholding a zero-tolerance policy for bribery, corruption and 
unethical behaviour throughout the organisation and in 
dealings with business partners
✓
 Maintaining sound risk management systems and internal
 
controls to ensure significant risks are identified and properly 
managed
✓
 Fostering 
a culture of ethics and integrity to ensure compliance 
with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements
Sound ethics, integrity and a strong compliance culture are at the 
heart of our operations, driving environmental, social and 
governance policy commitments at the highest level through to 
business practices on the ground. We actively engage with our 
stakeholders to ensure that we meet the expectations placed 
upon us.
Our Board is the gatekeeper for our Group’s values, culture and 
ethics. Standards of governance and behaviour are communicated 
through policies that cover areas including ethics and anti-bribery 
and corruption, and training on these issues is provided to 
employees.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Our Group has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate 
governance and protection of stakeholder value, which has been 
integral to the YTL Power Group’s achievements and strong 
financial profile to date. YTL Power’s corporate governance 
structure is a fundamental part of the Board’s responsibility to 
protect and enhance long-term value and the financial 
performance of the YTL Power Group for the benefit of all 
stakeholders.
Further details can be found in our Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement in this Annual Report, as well as our 
Corporate Governance Report for the financial year ended 30 June 
2023, which is available in the ‘Governance’ section of our website.
RISK MANAGEMENT & INTERNAL CONTROL 
FRAMEWORK
YTL Power has a sound system of risk management and internal 
control in place which covers not only financial controls but 
operational and compliance controls and risk management. Our 
system of risk management and internal control is a concerted 
and continuing process, designed to minimise the likelihood of 
fraud and error, and to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives.
Robust risk management is essential to our business so we 
regularly horizon-scan to identify material risks that could impact 
our ability to deliver the services on which our customers depend. 
We have a systematic Group-wide approach under which risk 
management reviews progress through a hierarchy of expert 
colleagues, senior managers and executive directors, overseen by 
dedicated risk management teams at our operating subsidiaries, 
escalating to the Group-level risk management and internal audit 
functions that brief the Audit Committee.
Details can be found in our Statement on Risk Management & 
Internal Control in this Annual Report.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
YTL Power adheres to the YTL Group’s Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics, which also sets out the whistleblowing policy and 
procedures, and the YTL Group’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
Policy (“ABC Policy”), both of which can be found in the 
‘Governance’ section of our website.
The ABC Policy further enforces the YTL Group’s Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics in order to ensure that all employees 
understand their responsibilities in compliance with the YTL 
Group’s zero tolerance for bribery and corruption within the 
organisation.
A comprehensive implementation plan has been established to 
communicate and disseminate the ABC Policy throughout YTL 
Power’s Malaysia-based workforce through online training 
modules and other communication methods. Electronic 
communications put in place over the past two years to comply 
with physical distancing guidelines implemented in response to 
the COVID-19 pandemic have proven highly effective and we have 
continued to employ these methods as part of the overall 
dissemination and training process.

Employees are required to read and understand the ABC Policy 
and the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, successfully 
complete the online training modules to reinforce their 
understanding of the policy and sign the YTL Group’s Integrity 
Pledge in acknowledgement of their obligations and responsibilities.
Compliance with the ABC Policy continues to be monitored closely, 
both on an ongoing basis and in conjunction with the annual 
assessment of the Group’s corruption risks. The annual risk 
assessment is carried out to identify the corruption risks to which 
the Group is exposed and the appropriateness of the mitigation 
measures established to minimise the exposure to these risks.
Training modules and other methods of communication are 
employed on an ongoing basis to familiarise employees with their 
duties and obligations in this area. Training carried out during the 
financial year under review focused on areas including data 
security and protection, cybersecurity awareness and an anti-
bribery and corruption refresher course. Topics covered in the 
refresher course included corruption, corporate liability, 
gratification, whistleblowing and best practices in preventing and 
reporting corruption.
The Wessex Group and YTL PowerSeraya maintain their own 
policies and procedures to manage anti-bribery and corruption 
matters, tailored to comply with the requirements, practices and 
standards in the UK and Singapore, respectively.
CYBERSECURITY & DATA PROTECTION
Security and resilience of our digital systems and protection of 
data are of critical importance to our business. We have 
appropriate systems in place to protect sensitive company 
information and safeguard information of the stakeholders with 
whom we interact and/or transact from misuse, theft and 
unauthorised access.
In Malaysia, the YTL Power Group operates under the umbrella of 
the YTL Group Cybersecurity Task Force which was established in 
2022 to safeguard the YTL Group from cyber threats and attacks. 
Under the task force, the YTL Zero Trust Framework (ZTF) was 
established as a guide to implementing effective and efficient 
cybersecurity best practices.
We strongly believe that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 
As the first line of defence against any major security risk, 
employee awareness and training have become critical 
components of our cybersecurity risk management strategy.  
A six-part cybersecurity training module was released during the 
year under review, covering cyberattacks, malware, impostor 
scams, phishing attacks, and best practices to protect oneself and 
the company from cybersecurity threats for our employees in 
Malaysia. Spanning a diverse spectrum of topics, this module 
equips our teams with the knowledge to effectively counter cyber 
threats. Simultaneously, the Task Force has also established a 
centralised channel for incident reporting, allowing employees to 
report on potential incidents or seek clarity on the legitimacy of 
the content that they had received. These reporting channels are 
consistently communicated on the intranet to ensure employee 
accessibility.
The Cybersecurity Task Force maintains a proactive stance by 
continually analysing threat intelligence to identify potential risks 
that could impact the Group. In collaboration with our subsidiaries, 
the Task Force is also actively engaging to assess existing levels 
of maturity and to provide guidance on enhancing cybersecurity 
defence mechanisms. This collaborative approach bolsters the 
overall cybersecurity resilience of our entire corporate ecosystem.
YTL PowerSeraya also adopts a Zero Trust framework and, during 
the past financial year, successfully completed the re-certification 
of ISO27001 information security management. These frameworks 
enable the company to identify and promptly address security-
related operational gaps. YTL PowerSeraya will continue to 
strengthen its cyber security capabilities to meet regulatory 
compliance, protect business information, safeguard personal 
data and ensure business continuity.
We adhere to the YTL Group’s Global Privacy Policy which functions 
to safeguard personal data and the privacy of our customers, 
employees and other stakeholders and strong emphasis is placed 
across the organisation on the need to comply with the Personal 
Data Protection Act 2010 in Malaysia and the applicable data 
protection regulations and legislation in all jurisdictions where we 
operate. These include the Personal Data Protection Act in 
Singapore, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data 
Protection Regulations (GDPR) which apply to European Union 
nationals. We will continuously monitor developments in data 
protection laws and industry best practices to adapt and enhance 
our data protection measures, ensuring the ongoing security and 
privacy of the data entrusted to us.

The Managing Director is responsible for, amongst others, overseeing 
the day-to-day running of the business, developing and implementing 
Board policies and strategies, making operational decisions, serving 
as the conduit between the Board and management in ensuring 
the success of the Company’s governance and management functions, 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and relevant 
stakeholders, providing strong leadership, i.e., effectively 
communicating the vision, management philosophy and business 
strategy to employees, and keeping the Board informed of salient 
aspects and issues concerning the Group’s operations.
The Managing Director and Executive Directors are accountable to 
the Board for the profitability and development of the YTL Power 
Group, consistent with the primary aim of enhancing long-term 
shareholder value. The Independent Non-Executive Directors have 
the experience and business acumen necessary to carry sufficient 
weight in the Board’s decisions and the presence of these 
Independent Non-Executive Directors brings an additional element 
of balance to the Board as they do not participate in the day-to-
day running of the YTL Power Group. 
The roles of Executive and Non-Executive Directors are differentiated, 
both having fiduciary duties towards shareholders. Executive 
Directors have a direct responsibility for business operations whereas 
Non-Executive Directors have the necessary skill and experience 
to bring an independent judgment to bear on issues of strategy, 
performance and resources brought before the Board. The Executive 
Directors are collectively accountable for the running and management 
of the YTL Power Group’s operations and for ensuring that strategies 
are fully discussed and examined, and take account of the long-
term interests of shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers 
and the many communities in which the YTL Power Group conducts 
its business.
In accordance with the Code, the Executive Chairman is not a 
member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee or 
Remuneration Committee, all of which are chaired by and comprise 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. This promotes objectivity in 
the Board’s deliberations and ensures there are effective checks 
and balances, as well as objective review by the Board of 
recommendations put forth by the committees. 
In the discharge of their responsibilities, the Directors have 
established functions which are reserved for the Board and those 
which are delegated to management. Key matters reserved for the 
Board’s approval include overall strategic direction, business 
expansion and restructuring plans, material acquisitions and disposals, 
expenditure over certain limits, issuance of new securities, payments 
of dividends and capital alteration plans. Further information on 
authorisation procedures, authority levels and other key processes 
can also be found in the Statement on Risk Management & Internal 
Control set out in this Annual Report.
Board Meetings & Procedures
Board meetings are scheduled with due notice in advance at least 
5 times in a year in order to review and approve the annual and 
interim financial results. Additional meetings may also be convened 
on an ad-hoc basis when significant issues arise relating to the YTL 
Power Group and when necessary to review the progress of its 
operating subsidiaries in achieving their strategic goals. Meetings of 
the Board’s committees are conducted separately from those of the 
main Board to enable objective and independent discussions. The 
Board met 5 times during the financial year ended 30 June 2023.
The Directors are fully apprised of the need to determine and disclose 
potential or actual conflicts of interest which may arise in relation 
to transactions or matters which come before the Board. In accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations, the Directors formally disclose 
any direct or indirect interests or conflicts of interests in such 
transactions or matters as and when they arise and abstain from 
deliberations and voting at Board meetings as required.
The Directors have full and unrestricted access to all information 
pertaining to the YTL Power Group’s business and affairs to enable 
them to discharge their duties. At least one week prior to each 
Board meeting, all Directors receive the agenda together with a 
comprehensive set of Board papers encompassing qualitative and 
quantitative information relevant to the business of the meeting. 
This allows the Directors to obtain further explanations or clarifications, 
where necessary, in order to be properly briefed before each meeting.
Board papers are presented in a consistent, concise and comprehensive 
format, and include, where relevant to the proposal put forward 
for the Board’s deliberation, approval or knowledge, progress reports 
on the YTL Power Group’s operations and detailed information on 
corporate proposals, major fund-raising exercises and significant 
acquisitions and disposals. Where necessary or prudent, professional 
advisers may be on hand to provide further information and respond 
directly to Directors’ queries. In order to maintain confidentiality, 
Board papers on issues that are deemed to be price-sensitive may 
be handed out to Directors during the Board meeting. 
The minutes of the Board and/or Board committee meetings are 
circulated and confirmed at the next meeting. Once confirmed, the 
minutes of the Board committee meetings are subsequently 
presented to the Board for notation.

Board Charter
The Board’s functions are governed and regulated by the Constitution 
of the Company and the laws, rules and regulations governing 
companies in Malaysia, including the Companies Act 2016 and the 
Listing Requirements. The Board has a Board Charter, a copy of 
which can be found under the “Governance” section on the Company’s 
website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com. 
The Board Charter serves several important functions, including as 
a primary reference to the Board of its role, fiduciary duties and 
responsibilities, its governance processes and legal framework 
within which it operates and as an induction tool for new Directors. 
The Board Charter clearly identifies the respective roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, Board committees, Directors and 
management and the issues and decisions reserved for the Board. 
The Board Charter was most recently updated and adopted on 27 
June 2022 to include, amongst others, the fit and proper policy for 
Directors and prohibition for an active politician to be a member 
of the Board in compliance with the Listing Requirements and the 
Code, respectively.
The Board Charter is reviewed as and when changes arise and 
updated in accordance with the needs of the Company and any 
new regulations that impact the discharge of the Board’s 
responsibilities.
Business Conduct, Ethics & Whistleblowing
The Directors observe and adhere to the Code of Ethics for Company 
Directors established by the Companies Commission of Malaysia, 
which encompasses the formulation of corporate accountability 
standards in order to establish an ethical corporate environment. 
YTL Power has an established track record for good governance 
and ethical conduct and is also guided by the corporate culture of 
its parent company, YTL Corporation Berhad (“YTL Corp”). 
Key guidance is contained in the Code of Conduct and Business 
Ethics of the YTL Group of Companies (“YTL Group”), which also sets 
out the whistleblowing policy and procedures, and the YTL Group’s 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, as detailed in the following section. 
A copy of the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics can be found on 
the Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
The Code of Conduct and Business Ethics sets out the acceptable 
general practices and ethics for the YTL Group and includes policies 
and measures to address conflicts of interest, abuse of power, 
corruption, insider trading, money laundering and data protection. 
Training modules and other methods of communication are employed 
on an ongoing basis to familiarise employees with their duties and 
obligations in this area. Training carried out during the financial 
year under review focused on areas including data security and 
protection, cybersecurity awareness and an anti-bribery and 
corruption refresher course.

Anti-Bribery & Corruption Policy (“ABC Policy”)
The objective of the ABC Policy is to further enforce the YTL Group’s 
Code of Conduct and Business Ethics in order to ensure that all 
Directors and employees understand their responsibilities in 
compliance with the YTL Group’s zero tolerance for bribery and 
corruption within the organisation. This is in line with the corporate 
liability provision in Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption 
Commission Act 2009 (“MACC Act”) which came into force on 1 
June 2020.
The ABC Policy outlines the YTL Group’s strategies in identifying, 
preventing and managing bribery and corruption issues. The policies 
and procedures put in place are guided by the Guidelines on 
Adequate Procedures issued pursuant to Section 17A(5) of the 
MACC Act. The ABC Policy applies to all Directors, managers and 
employees of the Company in dealing with external parties in the 
commercial context. The policy will be reviewed at least once every 
three years to ensure that it continues to remain relevant, 
appropriate and effective to enforce the principles highlighted 
therein and to ensure continued compliance with the prevailing 
law. A copy of the ABC Policy can be found on the Company’s 
website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
A comprehensive implementation plan has been established to 
communicate and disseminate the ABC Policy on an ongoing basis 
throughout the YTL Group through online training modules and 
other communication methods. Electronic communications put in 
place over the past three years to comply with physical distancing 
guidelines implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
have proven highly effective and the YTL Power Group has continued 
to employ these methods as part of the overall dissemination and 
training process.
Directors and employees of the YTL Group in Malaysia are required 
to read and understand the ABC Policy and the Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics, successfully complete the online training 
modules to reinforce their understanding of the policy and sign 
the YTL Group’s Integrity Pledge in acknowledgement of their 
obligations and responsibilities.
Compliance with the ABC Policy continues to be monitored closely, 
both on an ongoing basis and in conjunction with the annual 
assessment of the Group’s corruption risks. The annual risk 
assessment is carried out to identify the corruption risks to which 
the Group is exposed and the appropriateness of the mitigation 
measures established to minimise the exposure to these risks.
Sustainability Governance
The YTL Power Group has a long-standing commitment to ensuring 
that its businesses are viable and sustainable on a long-term basis. 
The Board oversees governance of the YTL Power Group’s 
sustainability matters which includes setting its environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) strategies, priorities and targets, 
overseeing the progress of ESG strategy and performance and 
reviewing and addressing the YTL Power Group’s material ESG risks 
and opportunities. Further information can be found in the ESG 
Report in this Annual Report and the “ESG” section on the Company’s 
website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
YTL Power’s ESG Committee is chaired by the Managing Director, 
Dato’ Yeoh Seok Hong, and comprises the Chief Sustainability 
Officer, Heads of the Legal, Corporate Finance and Project 
Development divisions, together with departmental heads with 
responsibility for ESG matters from key subsidiaries.
The ESG Committee supports the Board to set the high-level ESG 
direction and strategic focus, oversees the implementation of ESG 
strategies and related matters and reviews, and monitors and 
provides the YTL Power Group’s ESG strategic plans and initiatives 
across its value chain. The ESG Committee reports to the Board on 
an annual basis or more frequently, as and when needed.
The Company’s key methods for communicating its sustainability 
strategies, priorities and targets as well as performance against 
these targets to internal and external stakeholders include the 
Annual Report and the “ESG” section on the Company’s website at 
www.ytlpowerinternational.com. As part of the YTL Group, 
information on the YTL Power Group’s ESG performance is also 
included in the YTL Group Sustainability Report, which is issued 
annually and can be accessed from the YTL Group’s Sustainability 
website at www.ytl.com/sustainability.
The Directors are kept apprised of the key ESG issues relevant and 
specific to the YTL Power Group through briefings from the ESG 
Committee and management on performance, targets and operational 
updates, and also stay abreast with more general developments 
in the ESG arena through training programmes, further details of 
which are disclosed in the Nominating Committee Statement in 
this Annual Report.
The Board’s evaluation process includes criteria for addressing and 
managing significant risks that may have a considerable impact on 
the Company, and ESG risks are incorporated into this process as 
they form part of the overall risk management framework. Further 
details are set out in the section below on Evaluation of the Board

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023

---- Page 85 ----
Composition of the Board
The Board has 12 Directors, comprising 8 executive members and 
4 independent non-executive members. The Independent Directors 
comprise 33.3% of the Board, providing an effective check and 
balance in the functioning of the Board, and in compliance with 
the Listing Requirements, which require one-third of the Board to 
be independent.
The Directors are cognisant of the recommendation in the Code 
for the Board to comprise a majority of independent directors, and 
will assess the composition and size of the Board on an ongoing 
basis to ensure the needs of the Company are met. 
YTL Power is 55.57%-owned by YTL Corp, which is in turn 
50.20%-owned by Yeoh Tiong Lay & Sons Holdings Sdn Bhd (as 
at 30 June 2023). The Executive Directors are appointed by the 
major shareholder in accordance with its rights under the Companies 
Act 2016 and the Constitution of the Company. 
YTL Power is majority-owned by a single shareholder, unlike other 
listed companies that may have a dispersed shareholder base which 
enables a shareholder to exercise control despite holding a minority 
stake. The interests of the major shareholder are fully aligned with 
those of all shareholders of the Company.
The expertise and experience in both the day-to-day running of 
the Group’s businesses and the determination and setting of its 
broader strategy lies with the Executive Directors in order to ensure 
the ongoing ability to fulfil their roles and responsibilities as stewards 
of the Group’s businesses.
Nevertheless, the Company has in place appropriate and rigorous 
governance structures and internal controls necessary to safeguard 
the assets of the Group and protect shareholder value. There is 
robust oversight in the form of the Board’s Audit, Remuneration 
and Nominating committees, all of which are chaired by and comprise 
solely Independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board is of the view that the current Independent Non-Executive 
Directors have the experience and business acumen necessary to 
carry sufficient weight in the Board’s decisions, and act in the best 
interests of the shareholders.
There is currently one Independent Non-Executive Director, Encik 
Faiz Bin Ishak, who has served on the Board for a period exceeding 
the nine-year term limit as recommended in the Code. As he will 
have served as an Independent Non-Executive Director for a 
cumulative period of 12 years by 1 December 2023, Encik Faiz Bin 
Ishak will either be re-designated as a non-independent director 
or step down on or before 30 November 2023.
In accordance with the Company’s Constitution, at least one-third 
of the Directors are required to retire from office at each Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”) and may offer themselves for re-election 
by rotation. Directors who are appointed by the Board during the 
financial year are subject to re-election by shareholders at the next 
AGM held following their appointments.
The names of Directors seeking re-election at the forthcoming AGM 
are disclosed in the Notice of Annual General Meeting in this Annual 
Report, whilst the review of Directors proposed for re-election and 
their profiles can be found in the Nominating Committee Statement  
and the Profile of the Board of Directors, respectively. This 
information is also available under the “Governance” section on the 
Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
Board & Senior Management Appointments
The Nominating Committee is responsible for assessing suitable 
candidates for appointment to the Board for approval, with due 
regard for diversity, taking into account the required mix of skills, 
experience, age, gender, ethnicity, time commitment, background 
and perspective of members of the Board before submitting its 
recommendation to the Board for decision. 
The Nominating Committee is chaired by and comprises solely 
Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of the 
Nominating Committee is Datuk Seri Long See Wool. This complies 
with the recommendation under the Code that the chairman of 
the Nominating Committee should not be the chairman of the 
Board.
Whilst it has, to date, not been necessary to do so given the 
expertise of the Independent Non-Executive Directors, the Board 
will also endeavour to utilise independent sources including external 
human resources consultants and specialised databases, as 
appropriate.
Meanwhile, members of senior management are selected based 
on relevant industry experience, with due regard for diversity in 
skills, experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and perspective, 
and are appointed by the Executive Chairman and/or the Managing 
Director following recommendation by the Executive Director in 
charge of the relevant division.
ANNUAL REPORT 2023
83ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023

---- Page 86 ----
As the Board’s overriding aim is to maintain a strong and effective 
Board, it seeks to ensure that all appointments are made on merit, 
taking into account the collective balance of elements such as skills, 
experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and perspective.
The Board recognises the importance of encouraging and developing 
female talent at all levels. Currently, there are three female directors 
on the Board comprising 25% of the Board and, therefore, whilst 
the Board has not met the target of 30% women directors set out 
in the Code, it will continue to seek Board members of the highest 
calibre, and with the necessary strength, experience and skills to 
meet the needs of the YTL Power Group.
Evaluation of the Board
Annual evaluation of the Board as a whole, Board committees and 
the individual Directors is carried out by the Nominating Committee. 
The evaluation carried out during the financial year under review 
involved an annual assessment of the effectiveness of each individual 
Director, the Board’s committees and the Board as a whole with 
the objectives of assessing whether the Board, its committees and 
the Directors had effectively performed its/their roles and fulfilled 
its/their responsibilities, and devoted sufficient time commitment 
to the Company’s affairs, in addition to recommending areas for 
improvement. 
The assessment exercise was facilitated by the Company Secretary 
and took the form of completion of questionnaires/evaluation forms 
comprising a Board and Board Committees Effectiveness Evaluation 
Form, Director’s Performance Evaluation Form, Director’s Confirmation 
of Independence Form, Audit Committee Effectiveness Evaluation 
Form and Audit Committee Members Evaluation by Nominating 
Committee Form. 
The results of the annual evaluation carried out form the basis of 
the Nominating Committee’s recommendations to the Board for 
the re-election of Directors. As recommended in the Code, the 
Board will endeavour to utilise independent experts to facilitate 
the evaluation process, as and when appropriate. Further information 
on the activities of the Nominating Committee can be found in the 
Nominating Committee Statement set out in this Annual Report. 
This information is also available under the “Governance” section 
on the Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
Remuneration
Directors’ remuneration is decided in line with the objective 
recommended by the Code to determine the remuneration for 
Directors so as to attract, retain, motivate and incentivise Directors 
of the necessary calibre to lead the YTL Power Group successfully. 
In general, the remuneration of the Directors is reviewed against 
the performance of the individual and the YTL Power Group. The 
Executive Directors’ remuneration consists of basic salary, other 
emoluments and other customary benefits as appropriate to a 
senior management member, whilst the Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration comprises Directors’ fees and benefits. The component 
parts of remuneration are structured so as to link rewards to 
performance. Directors do not participate in decisions regarding 
their own remuneration packages. Directors’ fees and other benefits 
must be approved by shareholders at the AGM. 
The Remuneration Committee (“RC”) is chaired by and comprises 
solely Independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with 
the Code.
The RC assists in the implementation of the remuneration policy 
and procedures, including reviewing and recommending matters 
relating to the remuneration of the Directors and senior management. 
The RC also ensures that the remuneration policy and procedures 
remain appropriate based on prevailing practices and aligned with 
the strategy and values of the YTL Power Group.
The composition of the RC is set out below:-
•
 Datuk Seri 
Long See Wool (Chairman)
•
 Datuk Loo Took Gee
•
 Encik 
Faiz Bin Ishak
The terms of reference of the RC and Remuneration Policy  
and Procedures for Directors and Senior Management  can be  
found under the “Governance” section on the Company’s website 
at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
During the financial year ended 30 June 2023, the RC met once, 
attended by all members. The meeting, which was held on  
3 August 2022, assessed the remuneration of the Directors and 
senior management as well as fees and meeting attendance 
allowance (benefits) proposed for the Independent Non-Executive 
Directors (“INED Remuneration”), guided by the framework set 
out in the YTL Power Group Remuneration Policy and Procedures 
for Directors and Senior Management. The remuneration of the 
Directors and the INED Remuneration were benchmarked against 
comparable listed companies in Malaysia in terms of industry and 
size/market capitalisation. The RC also considered the performance 
of the Independent Non-Executive Directors as indicated by the 
evaluations conducted and responsibilities assumed by the Directors 
and senior management, as well as the overall performance of 
YTL POWER INTERNATIONAL BERHAD
84 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023

---- Page 87 ----
the Group. In view of the foregoing, the RC considered the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management 
to be reasonable.
The RC, with the Independent Non-Executive Director abstaining 
from deliberation and voting in respect of his/her own proposed 
remuneration, recommended to the Board for shareholders’ approval 
that the INED Remuneration remains unchanged as it was still 
competitive and on par with the market rate.
Details of the Directors’ remuneration categorised into appropriate 
components can be found in Note 6 in the Notes to the Financial 
Statements in this Annual Report. Meanwhile, as regards the 
remuneration of the YTL Power Group’s senior management team, 
the Board is of the view that the disclosure of these details would 
not be in the best interests of the YTL Power Group due to 
confidentiality and the competitive nature of the industries in which 
the YTL Power Group operates, as well as for business and personal 
security reasons. 
Board Commitment
In accordance with the Listing Requirements, members of the Board 
do not hold more than five directorships in public listed companies. 
This ensures that their commitment, resources and time are focused 
on the affairs of the YTL Power Group thereby enabling them to 
discharge their duties effectively.
Presently, each Board member is required to assess (via the annual 
assessment process) whether he/she devotes the necessary time 
and energy to fulfilling his/her commitments to the Company. The 
Board recognises that an individual’s capacity for work varies 
depending on various factors that weigh very much on his/her own 
assessment. Hence, having rigid protocols in place before any new 
directorships may be accepted is not practical. Each Board member 
is also expected to inform the Board whenever he/she is appointed 
as an officer of a corporation. In accordance with the Board Charter 
and guidance in the Code, none of the Directors are active politicians. 
The details of each Director’s attendance of Board meetings  
can be found in the Profile of the Board of Directors whilst  
details of the training programmes attended during the year  
under review are disclosed in the Nominating Committee Statement  
in this Annual Report. This information is also available under  
the “Governance” section on the Company’s website at  
www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
PRINCIPLE B:  
EFFECTIVE AUDIT & RISK MANAGEMENT
Integrity in Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that financial statements 
are drawn up in accordance with the Listing Requirements, Malaysian 
Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in 
Malaysia. The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities made pursuant 
to Section 248-249 of the Companies Act 2016 is set out in this 
Annual Report.
In presenting the financial statements, the Company has used 
appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported 
by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates, to present 
a true and fair assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. 
Interim financial reports were reviewed by the Audit Committee 
and approved by the Board prior to release to Bursa Securities. 
Audit Committee
The Company has in place an Audit Committee which comprises 
solely Independent Non-Executive Directors, in compliance with 
the Listing Requirements and the Code, namely Encik Faiz Bin Ishak, 
Datuk Seri Long See Wool and Datuk Loo Took Gee. The Chairman 
of the Audit Committee is Encik Faiz Bin Ishak, in accordance with 
the recommendations of the Code that the chairman of the Audit 
Committee should not be the chairman of the Board.
The members of the Audit Committee possess a wide range of 
necessary skills to discharge their duties, and are financially literate 
and able to understand matters under the purview of the Audit 
Committee including the financial reporting process. The members 
of the Audit Committee also intend to continue to undertake 
professional development by attending training to keep themselves 
abreast of relevant developments in accounting and auditing 
standards, practices and rules.
The Audit Committee holds quarterly meetings to review matters 
including the YTL Power Group’s financial reporting, the audit plans 
for the financial year and recurrent related party transactions, as 
well as to deliberate the findings of the internal and external 
auditors. 
The Audit Committee met 5 times during the financial year ended 
30 June 2023. Full details of the composition and a summary of 
the work carried out by the Audit Committee during the financial 
year can be found in the Audit Committee Report set out in this 
ANNUAL REPORT 2023

Annual Report. This information and the terms of reference of the 
Audit Committee are available under the “Governance” section on 
the Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
The Audit Committee has established formal and professional 
arrangements for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the 
Company’s external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT (“PwC 
Malaysia”). The external auditors also attend each AGM in order to 
address clarifications sought pertaining to the audited financial 
statements by shareholders.
The Audit Committee’s Auditor Independence Policy guides its 
assessment of the suitability, objectivity and independence of the 
external auditors. This policy was updated during the last financial 
year to, amongst others, extend the cooling off period to three 
years (from two years previously) for appointment of a former audit 
partner of the external audit firm as a member of the Audit Committee, 
and to include additional assessment criteria based on information 
presented in the Annual Transparency Report of the external 
auditors, in line with the Code. None of the Audit Committee members 
were formerly audit partners of YTL Power’s external auditors.
Details of the audit and non-audit fees paid/payable to PwC Malaysia 
and member firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited 
(“PwCIL”) for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 are as follows:-
Company

legal entities from PwC Malaysia
The non-audit fees incurred related mainly to advisory services on 
matters including pension schemes, equity and financial structuring, 
filing of tax returns, advisory and other general tax services and 
regulatory audits in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
Risk Management & Internal Control
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for maintaining 
a sound system of risk management and internal control to safeguard 
the investment of its shareholders and the YTL Power Group’s 
assets, and that these controls are designed to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against the risk of occurrence of 
material errors, fraud or losses.
Details of the YTL Power Group’s system of risk management and 
internal control are contained in the Statement on Risk Management 
& Internal Control and the Audit Committee Report as set out in

contained in the Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control  
and the Audit Committee Report as set out in this Annual Report.
PRINCIPLE C: 
INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING & 
MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH 
STAKEHOLDERS
Communication with Shareholders & Other Stakeholders
The YTL Power Group values dialogue with its stakeholders and 
constantly strives to improve transparency by maintaining channels 
of communication that enable the Board to convey information 
about performance, corporate strategy and other matters affecting 
stakeholders’ interests. The Board believes that a constructive and 
effective investor relationship is essential in enhancing stakeholder 
value and recognises the importance of timely dissemination of 
information to stakeholders. 
The Board ensures that shareholders are kept well-informed of 
any major development of the YTL Power Group. Such information 
is communicated through the Annual Report, the various  
disclosures and announcements to Bursa Securities, including 
quarterly and annual results, and corporate websites. Corporate 
information, annual financial results, governance information, 
business reviews and future plans are disseminated through  
the Annual Report, whilst current corporate developments  
are communicated via the Company’s corporate website at  
www.ytlpowerinternational.com and the YTL Group’s community 
website at www.ytlcommunity.com, in addition to prescribed 
information, including its interim financial results, announcements, 
circulars, prospectuses and notices, which is released through the 
official website of Bursa Securities. 
The Executive Chairman, Managing Director and/or the Executive 
Directors meet with analysts, institutional shareholders and investors 
throughout the year not only to promote the dissemination of the 
YTL Power Group’s financial results but to provide updates on 
strategies and new developments to ensure better understanding 
of the YTL Power Group’s operations and activities. Presentations 
based on permissible disclosures are made to explain the YTL Power 
Group’s performance and major development programs. 
 
Whilst efforts are made to provide as much information as possible 
to its shareholders and stakeholders, the Directors are cognisant 
of the legal and regulatory framework governing the release of 
material and sensitive information so as to not mislead its 
shareholders. Therefore, the information that is price-sensitive or 
that may be regarded as undisclosed material information about 
the YTL Power Group is not disclosed to any party until after the 
prescribed announcement to Bursa Securities has been made. 
Conduct of General Meetings
The AGM is the principal forum for dialogue with shareholders. The 
Board provides opportunities for shareholders to raise questions 
pertaining to issues in the Annual Report, corporate developments 
in the YTL Power Group, the resolutions being proposed and the 
business of the YTL Power Group in general at every general 
meeting of the Company. 
The Notice of the AGM and a circular to shareholders in relation 
to the renewal of the Company’s share buy-back and recurrent 
related party transactions mandates, if applicable, are sent to 
shareholders at least 28 days prior to the AGM in accordance with 
the Code, which also meets the criteria of the Listing Requirements 
and Companies Act 2016, which require the Notice of AGM to be 
sent 21 days prior to the AGM. This provides shareholders with 
sufficient time to review the YTL Power Group’s financial and 
operational performance for the financial year and to fully evaluate 
new resolutions being proposed to make informed voting decisions 
at the AGM. 
The Executive Chairman, Managing Director and Executive Directors 
take the opportunity to present a comprehensive review of the 
financial and non-financial performance of the YTL Power Group, 
as well as progress and long-term strategies. The Directors provide 
appropriate answers in response to shareholders’ questions during 
the meeting, thereby ensuring a high level of accountability, 
transparency and identification with the YTL Power Group’s business 
operations, strategy and goals.

The Directors are mindful of the recommendation under the Code 
that all directors must attend general meetings and fully appreciate 
the need for their attendance at all such meetings. All Directors 
attended the Company’s 26th AGM held on 6 December 2022, save 
for Dato’ Sri Michael Yeoh Sock Siong.
Extraordinary general meetings are held as and when required to 
seek shareholders’ approval. The Executive Chairman, Managing 
Director and Executive Directors take the opportunity to fully explain 
the rationale for proposals put forth for approval and the implications 
of such proposals for the Company, and to reply to shareholders’ 
questions. 
Where applicable, each item of special business included in the 
notice of the meeting is accompanied by an explanatory statement 
for the proposed resolution to facilitate full understanding and 
evaluation of the issues involved. All resolutions are put to vote 
by electronic poll voting and an independent scrutineer is appointed 
to verify poll results. The results of the electronic poll voting are 
announced in a timely manner, usually within half an hour of the 
voting process to enable sufficient time for the results to be 
tabulated and verified by the independent scrutineer.
The rights of shareholders, including the right to demand a poll, 
are found in the Constitution of the Company. At the 26th AGM of 
the Company, held on 6 December 2022, the resolutions put forth 
for shareholders’ approval were voted on by way of a poll. 
Where general meetings are held on a virtual basis, the Board 
utilises available platforms and technologies that support meaningful 
engagement with shareholders by ensuring smooth broadcast of 
the general meeting and enabling interactive participation by 
shareholders via facilities to submit questions before and during 
the general meeting. Questions posed by shareholders are made 
visible to all meeting participants during the meeting. 
The Company engages professional service providers to manage 
and administer its general meetings who have in place the necessary 
data privacy and protection and cybersecurity policies and procedures 
to safeguard the information of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Company endeavours to post the minutes of general  
meetings on the Company’s website under the “Meetings” page at 
https://www.ytlpowerinternational.com/meetings no later than  
30 business days after the general meeting. 
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and as part of the safety measures 
to curb its spread, the 26th AGM of the Company was conducted 
as a fully virtual meeting through live streaming and online  
remote participation and voting using the TIIH Online System at 
https://tiih.com.my provided by the appointed share registrar and 
poll administrator, Tricor Investor & Issuing House Services Sdn Bhd.
The forthcoming 27th AGM will also be held on a fully virtual basis, 
the details of which can be found in the Notice of Annual General 
Meeting in this Annual Report.
This statement and the CG Report were approved by the Board on 
27 September 2023.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023

---- Page 91 ----
During the financial year under review, the Board of Directors 
(“Board”) of YTL Power International Berhad (“YTL Power” or 
“Company”) reviewed the system of internal control and risk 
management of YTL Power and its subsidiaries (“YTL Power 
Group”), to ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of 
the Main Market Listing Requirements (“Listing Requirements”) 
of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) and the 
principles and practices of the Malaysian Code on Corporate 
Governance (“Code”).
The Board acknowledges its overall responsibility for maintaining 
a sound system of risk management and internal control to safeguard 
the investment of its shareholders and the assets of the YTL Power 
Group, and that these controls are designed to provide reasonable, 
but not absolute, assurance against the risk of occurrence of 
material errors, fraud or losses.
This statement sets out an overview of YTL Power’s compliance 
with the applicable provisions of the Code during the financial year 
ended 30 June 2023.
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD
The Board is ultimately responsible for maintaining a sound system 
of risk management and internal control which includes the 
establishment of an appropriate control environment framework 
to address the need to safeguard shareholders’ investments and 
the assets of the YTL Power Group, and for reviewing the adequacy 
and integrity of the system. The system of internal control covers 
not only financial controls but operational and compliance controls 
and risk management. 
However, the Board recognises that reviewing the YTL Power 
Group’s system of risk management and internal control is a 
concerted and continuing process, designed to minimise the likelihood 
of fraud and error, and to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. Accordingly, the system 
of risk management and internal control can only provide reasonable 
but not absolute assurance against material misstatement, fraud 
and loss.
The Board believes that the YTL Power Group’s system of risk 
management and internal control, financial or otherwise, in place 
for the financial year under review, should provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the achievement of the objectives of ensuring 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability and transparency 
of financial information and compliance with laws and regulations.
PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE YTL POWER GROUP’S 
SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is committed to maintaining a sound internal control 
structure that includes processes for continuous monitoring 
and review of effectiveness of control activities, and to govern 
the manner in which the YTL Power Group and its staff conduct 
themselves. The principal features which formed part of the 
YTL Power Group’s system of internal control can be summarised 
as follows:-
• Authorisation Procedures: The YTL Power Group has a clear 
definition of authorisation procedures and a clear line of 
accountability, with strict authorisation, approval and control 
procedures within the Board and the senior management. 
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the YTL 
Power Group which set out, among others, authorisation levels, 
segregation of duties and other control procedures to promote 
effective and independent stewardship in the best interests 
of shareholders.
•
 Authority Levels: 
The YTL Power Group has delegated 
authority levels for tenders, capital expenditure projects, 
acquisitions and disposals of businesses and other significant 
transactions to the Executive Chairman/Managing Director/
Executive Directors. The approval of capital and revenue proposals 
above certain limits is reserved for decision by the Board. Other 
investment decisions are delegated for approval in accordance 
with authority limits. Comprehensive appraisal and monitoring 
procedures are applied to all major investment decisions.
 The 
authority of the Directors is required for decisions on key 
treasury matters, including financing of corporate and investment 
funding requirements, foreign currency and interest rate risk 
management, investments, insurance and designation of 
authorised signatories.
• Financial Performance: Interim financial results are reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board upon 
recommendation of the Audit Committee before release to 
Bursa Securities. The full year financial results and analyses of 
the YTL Power Group’s state of affairs are disclosed to 
shareholders after review and audit by the external auditors.

STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT & INTERNAL CONTROL
for the financial year ended 30 June 2023

---- Page 92 ----
• Internal Compliance: The YTL Power Group monitors 
compliance with its internal financial controls through 
management reviews and reports which are internally reviewed 
by key personnel to enable it to gauge achievement of annual 
targets. Updates of internal policies and procedures are 
undertaken to reflect changing risks or resolve operational 
deficiencies, as well as changes to legal and regulatory compliance 
requirements relevant to the YTL Power Group. Internal audit 
visits are systematically arranged over specific periods to monitor 
and scrutinise compliance with procedures and assess the 
integrity of financial information provided.
KEY PROCESSES OF THE YTL POWER GROUP’S 
SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL
The key processes that the Board has established to review the 
adequacy and integrity of the system of internal control are as 
follows:-
•
 Internal Audit Function: 
The YTL Power Group’s internal 
audit function is carried out by the Internal Audit department 
within the YTL Corporation Berhad Group (“YTLIA”), which 
provides assurance on the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
internal control systems implemented by management, and 
reports directly to the Audit Committee. A description of the 
work of the internal audit function can be found in the Audit 
Committee Report, whilst additional details about the personnel 
and resources of YTLIA are contained in the Corporate Governance 
Overview Statement set out in this Annual Report. This 
information is also available under the “ Governance” section on 
the Company’s website at www.ytlpowerinternational.com.
 Y TLIA operates independently of the work it audits and provides 
periodic reports to the Audit Committee, reporting on the 
outcome of the audits conducted which highlight the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the system of internal control and significant 
risks. The Audit Committee reviews and evaluates the key 
concerns and issues raised by YTLIA and ensures that appropriate 
and prompt remedial action is taken by management.
 None of the weaknesses or issues identified during the review 
for the financial year has resulted in non-compliance with any 
relevant policies or procedures, the Listing Requirements or 
recommended industry practices that would require disclosure 
in the Company’s Annual Report.
 The companies of the Wessex Water Limited group (“Wessex 
Water”) based 
in the United Kingdom (“UK”) were not covered 
by the internal audit process discussed above. Wessex Water’s 
operations are subject to stringent financial and operational 
controls imposed by its regulator, the UK Water Services 
Regulation Authority (known as Ofwat), a government body, 
and by its regulatory licence. Wessex Water Services Limited 
(“WWSL”) possesses its own internal audit department. The 
internal audit department reports to WWSL’s audit committee, 
which has the responsibility to ensure the preservation of good 
financial practices and monitor the controls that are in place 
to ensure the integrity of those practices. It reviews the annual 
financial statements and provides a line of communication 
between the board of directors and the external auditors. It 
has formal terms of reference which deal with its authorities 
and duties, and its findings are presented to the Audit Committee. 
 Similarly, the companies of the YTL PowerSeraya Pte Limited 
group (“YTL PowerSeraya”) based in Singapore were also not 
covered by YTLIA. YTL PowerSeraya’s operations are subject
 
to stringent financial and operational controls imposed by its 
regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA), a statutory board 
under the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore. YTL 
PowerSeraya outsourced its internal audit functions to a 
reputable professional firm which reports to its audit committee 
and its findings are also presented to the Audit Committee. YTL 
PowerSeraya has the responsibility to ensure that the internal 
controls and systems in place are maintained to provide 
reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of its 
financial statements.
 The system of internal control will continue to be reviewed,
 
enhanced and updated in line with changes in the operating 
environment. The Board will seek regular assurance on the 
continuity and effectiveness of the internal control system 
through appraisals by YTLIA. The Board is of the view that the 
current system of internal control in place throughout the YTL 
Power Group is effective to safeguard its interests.
• Executive Board/Senior Management Meetings : The YTL 
Power Group conducts regular meetings of the executive board/
senior management which comprise the Executive Chairman/
Managing Director/Executive Directors and divisional heads/
senior managers. These meetings are convened to deliberate 
and decide upon urgent company matters and to review, identify, 
discuss and resolve significant financial and treasury matters 
and to monitor the financial standing of the YTL Power Group.

They also serve to ensure that any new financial developments 
and/or areas of concern are highlighted early and can be dealt 
with promptly. Decisions can then be effectively communicated 
to all relevant staff levels in a timely manner. From these 
meetings, the executive board/management is able to identify 
significant operational and financial risks of the business units 
concerned.
• Site Visits: The Managing Director/Executive Directors undertake 
site visits to operating units and communicate with various 
levels of staff to gauge first-hand the effectiveness of strategies 
discussed and implemented. This is to ensure that management 
and the Managing Director/Executive Directors maintain a 
transparent and open channel of communication for effective 
operation.
KEY FEATURES & PROCESSES OF THE YTL POWER 
GROUP’S RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
The YTL Power Group’s strong financial profile is the result of a 
system of internal control and risk management designed to mitigate 
risks which arise in the course of business. This is exemplified by 
the YTL Power Group’s strategy of acquiring regulated assets and 
financing acquisitions on a non-recourse basis. These include Wessex 
Water and YTL PowerSeraya, as well as its interests in P.T. Jawa 
Power and Attarat Power Company PSC. These assets share common 
characteristics of predictable operating costs and revenue streams, 
which in turn generate stable and predictable cash flows and profits, 
underpinned by an established regulatory environment in their 
respective markets of operation. 
 
The 
Board acknowledges that all areas of the YTL Power Group’s 
business activities involve some degree of risk. The YTL Power 
Group is committed to ensuring that there is an effective risk 
management framework which allows management to manage 
risks within defined parameters and standards, and promotes 
profitability of the YTL Power Group’s operations in order to enhance 
shareholder value. 
The Board assumes overall responsibility for the YTL Power Group’s 
risk management framework. Identifying, evaluating and managing 
any significant risks faced by the YTL Power Group is an ongoing 
process which is undertaken by senior management at each level 
of operations and by the Audit Committee, which assesses and 
analyses these findings and reports to the Board. At the same time, 
YTLIA, in the performance of its internal audit function, will identify 
and evaluate any significant risks faced by the YTL Power Group 
and report these findings to the Audit Committee. During the 
financial year under review, the Board’s functions within the risk 
management framework were exercised primarily by the Managing 
Director/Executive Directors through their participation in 
management meetings to ensure the adequacy and integrity of 
the system of internal control. Emphasis is placed on reviewing 
and updating the process for identifying and evaluating the significant 
risks affecting the business, and policies and procedures by which 
these risks are managed. 
The YTL Power Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial 
risks, including market risk (comprising foreign currency exchange 
risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and 
capital risk. The YTL Power Group’s overall financial risk management 
objective is to ensure that the YTL Power Group creates value for 
its shareholders. The YTL Power Group focuses on the unpredictability 
of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects 
on its financial performance. Financial risk management is carried 
out through regular risk review analysis, internal control systems 
and adherence to the YTL Power Group’s financial risk management 
policies. The Board reviews these risks and approves the appropriate 
control environment framework. Further discussion and details on 
the YTL Power Group’s risk management is contained in the 
Management Discussion & Analysis in this Annual Report. 
Management is responsible for creating a risk-aware culture within 
the YTL Power Group and for the identification and evaluation of 
significant risks applicable to their areas of business, together with 
the design and operation of suitable internal controls. These risks 
are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a 
variety of internal and external sources including control breakdowns, 
disruption in information systems, competition, natural catastrophe 
and regulatory requirements. Significant changes in the business 
and the external environment which affect significant risks will be 
reported by management to the Board in developing a risk mitigation 
action plan. Where areas for improvement in the system are 
identified, the Board considers the recommendations made by the 
Audit Committee and the internal auditors.
The Board will pursue its ongoing process of identifying, assessing 
and managing key business, operational and financial risks faced 
by its business units as well as regularly reviewing planned strategies 
to determine whether risks are mitigated and well-managed, and 
to ensure compliance with the guidelines issued by the relevant 
authorities. This is to ensure the YTL Power Group is able to respond

effectively to the constantly changing business environment in 
order to protect and enhance stakeholders’ interests and shareholder 
value. 
REVIEW BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS
As required under Paragraph 15.23 of the Listing Requirements, 
the external auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT, have reviewed 
this Statement on Risk Management & Internal Control. Their review 
was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice 
Guide (“AAPG”) 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. 
Based on their review, they have reported to the Board that nothing 
has come to their attention that causes them to believe that this 
Statement is inconsistent with their understanding of the process 
the Board has adopted in reviewing the adequacy and integrity of 
internal control and risk management of the YTL Power Group. 
AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to form an opinion 
on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and 
internal control systems of the YTL Power Group.
CONCLUSION
The Board is of the view that the system of risk management and 
internal control being instituted throughout the YTL Power Group 
is sound and effective. The monitoring, review and reporting 
arrangements in place give reasonable assurance that the structure 
and operation of controls are appropriate for the YTL Power Group’s 
operations and that risks are at an acceptable level throughout its 
businesses. The Managing Director is primarily responsible for the 
financial management of YTL Power and has provided assurance 
to the Board that the YTL Power Group’s risk management and 
internal control system is operating adequately and effectively. 
Reviews of all the control procedures will be continuously carried 
out to ensure the ongoing effectiveness and adequacy of the 
system of risk management and internal control, so as to safeguard 
shareholders’ investments and the YTL Power Group’s assets.
This statement was approved by the Board on 24 August 2023.

effectiveness of key controls in responding to risks within the 
organisation’s governance, operations and information systems 
regarding:-
• reliability and integrity of financial and operational information;
• effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
•
 safeguarding of assets; and
• compliance with relevant laws, regulations and contractual
 
obligations.
The work of the internal audit function during the year under 
review include the following:-
1. Developed the annual internal audit plan and proposed the
 
plan to the Audit Committee.
2. Conducted scheduled and special internal audit engagements, 
focusing primarily on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
internal controls and recommended improvements where 
necessary.
3.
 Conducted follow-up reviews to assess 
if appropriate action 
has been taken to address issues highlighted in previous audit 
reports.
4. P resented significant audit findings and areas for improvements 
raised by the IA to the Audit Committee for consideration on 
the recommended corrective measures together with the 
management’s response.
5. Conducted RRPT reviews to assess accuracy and completeness 
of reporting for presentation to the Audit Committee, and 
ensure compliance with the Listing Requirements.
6. C
onducted discussions with management in identifying 
significant concerns and risk areas perceived by management 
for inclusion in the internal audit plan.
7. Conducted discussions with management to identify, analyse,  
assess and prioritise the internal and external corruption risks, 
for the purpose of establishing appropriate processes, systems 
and controls to mitigate the specific corruption risks exposure.
Costs amounting to RM1,926,255 were incurred in relation to the

POLICY ON BOARD COMPOSITION
As the Board’s overriding aim is to maintain a strong and effective 
Board, it seeks to ensure that all appointments are made on merit, 
taking into account the collective balance of elements such as skills, 
experience, age, gender, ethnicity, background and perspective. 
The Board recognises the importance of encouraging and developing 
female talent at all levels. Currently, three of the Company’s Directors 
are women and make up 25% of the full Board. Although it has 
not set any specific measurable objectives, the Board intends to 
continue its current approach to diversity in all aspects while at 
the same time seeking Board members of the highest caliber, and 
with the necessary strength, experience and skills to meet the 
needs of the Company.
INDUCTION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT OF 
DIRECTORS
Upon joining the Board, a newly appointed Director will be given 
an induction pack containing the Company’s annual report, various 
policies adopted by the Company, terms of references of the Board 
Committees, Constitution, and schedule of meetings of the Board 
and Board Committees (if the Director is also a Committee member) 
which will serve as an initial introduction to the YTL Power Group 
as well as an ongoing reference. Visits to the YTL Power Group’s 
operational sites and meetings with senior management may also 
be arranged as practicable and appropriate.
The Board, through the NC, assesses the training needs of its 
Directors on an ongoing basis by determining areas that would 
best strengthen their contributions to the Board. 
Besides the findings from the annual performance evaluation of 
Directors, which provide the NC with useful insights into the training 
needs of the Directors, each Director is requested to identify 
appropriate training that he/she believes will enhance his/her 
contribution to the Board.
The Board has taken steps to ensure that its members have access 
to appropriate continuing education programmes. The Company 
Secretary facilitates the organisation of in-house development 
programmes and keeps Directors informed of relevant external 
training programmes.

STATUTORY INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(a)
 to 
ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful 
debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for 
doubtful debts; and
(b)
 to ensure that any current assets, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including the values o
f 
current assets as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which 
the current assets might be expected so to realise.
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(a) which would render the amounts written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial
 
statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(b) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleadi ng; 
or
(c)
 which have arisen which would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of
 
the Company misleading or inappropriate.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements of YTL Power International Berhad (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) give a true 
and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2023, and of their financial performance and their 
cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting 
Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 
30 June 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of 
changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 134 to 281.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” 
section of our report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) 
of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code 
of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Our audit approach
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect 
of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in 
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration 
of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as 
a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry 
in which the Group and the Company operate.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements 
of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion 
on these matters.
Key audit matters How our audit addressed the key audit matters
Impairment review of goodwill
Refer to Note 2(d)(ii) – significant accounting policies, Note 3(a) 
– critical accounting estimates and judgements, and Note 13 – 
intangible assets
The Group recorded goodwill of RM9,063.4 million as at 30 June 
2023, primarily allocated to the power generation segment in 
Singapore and water and sewerage segment in the United 
Kingdom. Goodwill for these segments represents 98.4% of 
total goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGUs”) 
are determined based on value-in-use (“VIU”) calculations. Based 
on the annual impairment test performed, the Directors concluded 
that no impairment is required for goodwill. The key assumptions 
and sensitivities are disclosed in Note 13(a)(i) and 13(a)(ii) to the 
financial statements.
We focused on this area as the estimation of the recoverable 
amounts is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement 
on the future cash flows, terminal growth rate and discount rate 
applied to the projected cash flows.
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We discussed with management the assumptions underlying the  
cash flow projections;
•
 We evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions used by 
management in the approved cash flow projections by comparing 
the discount rate, revenue growth rates and terminal growth 
rates against publicly available macroeconomic and industry data, 
as well as historical data and market expectations from industry 
reports, where available;
• We were assisted by our valuation expert in assessing the
 
assumptions used and the appropriateness of the methodology 
adopted by management for impairment assessment in accordance 
with MFRS 136 “Impairment of Assets”;
• We assessed the reliability of the approved budget by comparing 
the previous years’ approved budget against past trends of actual 
results;
• We checked the appropriateness of sensitivity analysis performed  
by management, including disclosures, on reasonable possible   
changes in key assumptions and the corresponding effect on 
the recoverable amounts; and
•
 We checked the appropriateness of disclosures in the financial 
statements.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material 
exceptions.

Capitalisation of infrastructure assets of the water and 
sewerage segment
Refer to Note 2(b) – significant accounting policies, Note 3(b) 
– critical accounting estimates and judgements, and Note 10 – 
property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
As at 30 June 2023, the net book value of infrastructure assets 
of the water and sewerage segment amounted to RM10,209.2 
million. Due to the high value of capital expenditure on 
infrastructure assets, judgements made on the classification of 
expenses as operating or capital, and within capital between 
maintenance and enhancement, are key to the preparation of 
the accounts.
We focused on this area since there is significant judgement 
involved in determining whether such expenditure meet the 
recognition criteria for capitalisation in accordance with MFRS 
116, Property, Plant and Equipment (“MFRS 116”).
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over
 
authorisation of selected projects’ infrastructure assets and 
identification of capital expenditures attributable to the 
infrastructure assets;
•
 We understood the nature of costs incurred through discussion 
with management and corroborated with supporting information 
provided and checked whether the costs incurred met the 
capitalisation criteria in accordance with MFRS 116;
• We challenged management’s assumptions used in allocating
 
certain costs between capital and operating expenditure. 
Specifically, this has included assessing the appropriate 
capitalisation of the following types of costs; overheads, interest, 
and infrastructure maintenance; and
• We sampled capital expenditure costs in the year and agreed
 
the costs to underlying support, including timesheets and invoices.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Expected credit losses assessment on trade receivables 
of the Group’s water and sewerage segment
Refer to Note 2(m)(iv) – significant accounting policies, Note 3(d) 
– critical accounting estimates and judgements and Note 18 – 
receivables, deposits and prepayments
As at 30 June 2023, trade receivables of the water and sewerage 
segment amounted to RM524.9 million, net of expected credit 
losses charges of RM307.4 million.
As this segment operates in the United Kingdom (“UK”), there 
is a statutory requirement to continue to provide water to all 
customers who has defaulted in payment. Therefore, the Group 
has estimated the expected credit losses of trade receivables 
on a portfolio basis for the year based on the historical cash 
collection trends and economic trends, which are subjective in 
nature.
We focused on this area given the use of significant estimates 
and judgement in determining the appropriate level of expected 
credit losses for trade receivables.
We performed the following audit procedures:
•
 We tested the operating effectiveness of the key information 
technology systems used for generating billings and cash collection 
data used for the expected credit losses assessment and the 
controls over assessment of expected credit losses of trade 
receivables;
•
 We performed substantive testing to ensure the completeness 
and accuracy of the reports used to populate the expected credit 
loss provision calculation;
• We  obtained the historical cash collection trends of each ageing 
bracket of the trade receivables and payment methods and 
compared against the percentage of expected credit losses used 
by management against each ageing bracket and payment 
methods;
• We chec ked the appropriateness of the forward-looking forecasts 
assumptions used to determine the expected credit losses, which 
included management’s scenario analysis of the impact of 
economic uncertainty due to inflation;
• W e compared the level of expected credit losses charged against 
similar companies within the industry in the UK; and
• We  developed expectations to generate a range for the estimated 
value and compared against the estimates and assumptions set 
forth by management to ensure no management bias over the 
expected credit losses.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Metered income accrual
Refer to Note 2(m) and Note 2(v)(ii) – significant accounting 
policies, Note 3(g) – critical accounting estimates and judgements, 
Note 4 – revenue and Note 18 – receivables, deposits and 
prepayments
The Group has recorded a metered income accrual of RM640.4 
million as at 30 June 2023 relating to revenue from the provision 
of water services to customers on water meters that had not 
been read at the year-end date.
Revenue recognition in respect of the accrued income is particularly 
judgemental. It arises in relation to the unbilled income accrual 
from metered water services. This income accrual requires an 
estimation of the amount of unbilled charges at the period end. 
It is calculated using system generated information based on 
previous customer volume usage.
We focused on this area given the estimation uncertainty 
regarding a range of factors underlying the estimates and 
judgement used in determining the metered income accrual and 
revenue.
We performed the following audit procedures:
•
 We obtained an understanding of the process for the supply of 
measured 
services, meter reading and related billing;
• We tested the key controls linked to system generated information 
and around the estimation process for measured revenue;
•
 We compared the accrued income to bills raised post year end 
and compared management’s history of estimating the accrued 
income balance to bills raised in the subsequent year to assess 
the accuracy of 
accrual income balance;
• We recomputed the accrued income based on customers’ historical  
usage data for selected samples;
• We perform analytical procedures by comparing revenue balances  
for the year against expectation and obtaining support for 
significant variances;
•
 We corroborated the key assumptions and estimates made by 
management in recognising revenue, by obtaining internal and 
external data on factors that influence demand from customers;
• We tested contract terms and conditions were met and revenue  
recognised at the correct period;
• We performed journal testing over targeted manual entries
 
related to revenue, particularly those recorded close to the year 
end; and
•
 We obtained an understanding of manual adjustments made to 
accrued income and reviewed the underlying assumptions for
 
those adjustments.
Based on the procedures performed above, we did not identify any 
material exceptions.

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment

a)
 Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment 
(“PPE”)
The Group has PPE related to its telecommunications segment 
with an aggregate carrying values of RM1,993.8 million as 
at 30 June 2023.
The Group performed an impairment assessment on the 
carrying values of the PPE due to the losses recorded by 
the segment which is an impairment indicator.
The impairment assessment was performed by management 
using fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) cash flows 
which requires significant judgement as the timing and 
quantum of the cash flows is dependent on the achievement 
of the next five years’ business plans and financial budgets 
which are dependent on the use of key assumptions 
especially its growth targets.
Based on the annual impairment test performed, the 
Directors concluded that no impairment of PPE is required.
a) I mpairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
We performed the following audit procedures:
• We discussed with management the assumptions underlying  
the cash flow projections;
• We assessed key assumptions including the discount rate,
 
average service revenue growth rate, earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) margin, long-
term growth rate and useful life of the assets by comparing 
these assumptions against publicly available macroeconomic 
and industry data, as well as historical data and market 
expectations from industry reports, where available;
•
 We were assisted by our valuation expert in assessing the 
assumptions 
used and the appropriateness of the 
methodology adopted by management for impairment 
assessment in accordance with MFRS 136 “Impairment of 
Assets”;
• We assessed the reliability of the approved budget by
 
comparing the previous years’ approved budget against 
past trends of actual results; and
• We checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management  
by stress testing the discount rate, average service revenue 
growth rate and terminal year EBITDA margin.

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment 
of the Group and investment in subsidiaries of the 
Company (continued)
b) Impairment assessment on cost of investment in the separate  
financial statements of the Company
The cost of investment in the telecommunications segment 
in the separate financial statement of the Company as at 
30 June 2023 amounted to RM3,853.3 million. Given the 
impairment indicator as described above, the Group has 
performed an impairment assessment and estimated the 
recoverable amount based on FVLCD cash flows and the 
Directors have concluded that no impairment on the cost 
of investment is required.
We focused on (a) and (b) above as the estimation of the 
recoverable amounts is inherently uncertain and requires 
significant judgement on the future cash flows, terminal growth 
rate and the discount rate applied to the calculation of the 
FVLCD.
b)
 Impairment assessment on cost of investment in the separate 
financial statements of the 
Company
In addition to the procedures performed on the cash flows 
from the underlying PPE of the subsidiary as described above, 
we have performed the following audit procedures:
•
 We assessed key assumptions including the discount rate 
which reflects the specific risk relating to investment in
 
the subsidiary and terminal growth rate by comparing these 
assumptions against publicly available macroeconomic and 
industry data, as well as historical data and market 
expectations from industry reports, where available;
•
 We were assisted by our valuation expert in assessing the 
assumptions 
used and the appropriateness of the 
methodology adopted by management for impairment 
assessment in accordance with MFRS 136 “Impairment of 
Assets”; and
• We checked the sensitivity analysis performed by management  
on terminal growth rate, discount rate, average service 
revenue growth rate and terminal year EBITDA margin.
We checked the appropriateness of disclosures for (a) and (b) above 
in the financial statements.
Based on the procedures performed, we did not identify any material 
exceptions.

Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, Statement 
on Risk Management and Internal Control, Executive Chairman’s Statement, Managing Director’s Review, Management Discussion & 
Analysis, Environment, Social & Governance Report, Corporate Governance Overview Statement, Audit Committee Report, Nominating 
Committee Statement and other sections of the 2023 Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and 
of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required 
to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing 
in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise 
professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
(a)
 Identify 
and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of 
internal control.
(b)
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in t
he 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the Company’s internal 
control.
(c)
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
 
made by the Directors.
(d)
 Conclude 
on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our 
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including  
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and 
to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where 
applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare 
circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted 
as auditors, are disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.
OTHER MATTERS
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in 
Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

2. S IGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies have been used consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to 
the financial statements.
(a)
 Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared under the historical cost convention (unless
 
stated otherwise in the significant accounting policies below).
The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also 
requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group’s and the Company’s accounting policies. 
Although these estimates and judgement are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of current events and actions, actual 
results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates 
are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements.

(a) Basis of preparation (continued)
 The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (’000) 
except as otherwise 
indicated.
(i)
 Amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable for the Group’s and the Company’s 
financial year beginning on or after 1 July 2022 are as follows:
Effective for 
financial periods 
beginning on
or after
Amendments to MFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations – Reference to the Conceptual Framework’ 1 January 2022
Amendments to MFRS 116 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment – Proceeds Before Intended Use’ 1 January 2022
Amendments to MFRS 137 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets – Onerous 
Contracts ‘Cost of Fulfilling a Contract’
1 January 2022
Annual Improvements to Illustrative Example accompanying MFRS 16 Leases: Lease Incentives 1 January 2022

1 January 2022
Annual Improvements to MFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments – Fees in the 10 per cent test for 
Derecognition of Financial Liabilities’
1 January 2022
The adoption of the above applicable amendments to published standards have not given rise to any material impact on 
the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
(ii) Amen dments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective
a) Financial year beginning on/after 1 July 2023
•
 MFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (effective from 1 January 2023) introduces consistent accounting for all insurance 
contracts based on a current measurement model. Under MFRS 17, the general model requires entities to recognise 
and measure a group of insurance contracts at: (i) a risk-adjusted present value of future cash flows that 
incorporates information that is consistent with observable market information; plus (ii) an amount representing 
the unearned profit in the group of contracts.
•
 Amendments to MFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (effective from 1 January 2023). The amendments are designed 
to minimise the risk of disruption to implementation already underway and do not change the fundamental
 
principles of the standard or reduce the usefulness of information for investors. In addition, the amendments 
also defer the effective date of MFRS 17 by two years to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2023.
•
 Amendments to MFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ – Initial Application of MFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ and MFRS 9 
‘Financial Instruments’ – Comparative Information (effective from 1 January 2023) – In order to avoid the temporary 
accounting mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract liabilities in the comparative information 
presented on initial application of MFRS 17 and MFRS 9, the amendment provides an option for the presentation 
of comparative information about financial assets as if the classification and measurement requirements of MFRS 
9 had been applied to that financial asset.

2. S IGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(a) Basis of preparation (continued)
(ii) Amendment s to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective 
(continued)
a)
 Financial year 
beginning on/after 1 July 2023 (continued)
•
 Amendments 
to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective 
from 1 January 2023) require entities to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their 
significant accounting policies. The Amendments, amongst others, also include examples of circumstances in 
which an entity is likely to consider an accounting policy information to be material to its financial statements.
• A
mendments to MFRS 108 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’ – Definition of 
Accounting Estimates (effective from 1 January 2023) revise the definition of accounting estimates to clarify 
how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The 
distinction is important because changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively to transactions, other 
events, or conditions from the date of that change, but changes in accounting policies are generally also applied 
retrospectively to past transactions and other past events. An entity shall apply the amendments to changes in 
accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual 
reporting period in which it applies the amendments.
•
 Amendments to MFRS 112 ‘Income Taxes’ – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single 
Transaction (effective from 1 January 2023) clarify that the initial exemption rule does not apply to transactions 
where both an asset and a liability are recognised at the same time such as leases and decommissioning obligations. 
Accordingly, entities are required to recognise both deferred tax assets and liabilities for all deductible and taxable 
temporary differences arising from such transactions.
•
 Amendments to MFRS 112 ‘Income Taxes’ – International Tax Reform—Pillar Two Model Rules (effective from 1 
January 2023) give entities temporary relief from recognising and disclosing accounting for deferred taxes arising 
from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) international tax reform; and 
introduces targeted disclosure requirements to help investors better understand an entity’s exposure to income 
taxes arising from the reform, particularly before legislation implementing the rules is in effect. Applying the 
temporary relief, entities neither recognise nor disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities 
related to Pillar Two income taxes. The relief will help to ensure consistency in the financial statements while 
easing into the implementation of the rules by allowing time for entities to assess how they are affected. And, 
we have applied the temporary exception.
b)
 Financial year 
beginning on/after 1 July 2024
•
 Amendments to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-
current (effective from 1 January 2024) clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current,
 
depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period. Classification is unaffected by the entity’s 
expectations or events after the reporting date (e.g. the receipt of a waiver or a breach of covenant). The 
amendments shall be applied retrospectively.

(ii) Amendment s to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective

b)
 Financial year 
beginning on/after 1 July 2024 (continued)
• Amendments to MFRS 101 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (effective 
from 1 January 2024) specify that covenants of loan arrangements which an entity must comply with only after 
the reporting date would not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the reporting date. 
However, those covenants that an entity is required to comply with on or before the reporting date would affect 
classification of a liability as current or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the reporting 
date. The amendments shall be applied retrospectively.
• A mendments to MFRS 16 ‘Leases’ – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (effective from 1 January 2024) specify 
the measurement of the lease liability arises in a sale and leaseback transaction that satisfies the requirements 
in MFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ to be accounted for as a sale. In accordance with the 
amendments, the seller-lessee shall determine the “lease payments” or “revised lease payments” in a way that 
it does not result in the seller-lessee recognising any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use 
it retains. The amendments shall be applied retrospectively to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after 
the date when the seller-lessee initially applied MFRS 16.
•
 Amendments to MFRS 107 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ and MFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ – Supplier 
Finance Arrangements (effective from 1 January 2024) require entities to disclose information that would enable 
users of financial statements to assess how supplier finance arrangements affect an entity’s operations; including 
the effects supplier finance arrangements have on an entity’s liability, cash flows and exposures to liquidity risk. 
The new disclosure requirements would also inform users of financial statements on how an entity might be 
affected if the arrangements were no longer available to it.
c)
 Financial year 
beginning on/after 1 July 2025
• A mendments to MFRS 121 ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates’- Lack of Exchangeability (effective 
from 1 January 2025) clarify that entities will be applying a consistent approach in determining if a currency can 
be exchanged into another currency. These amendments provide guidance on the spot exchange rate to use 
when a currency is not exchangeable into another currency and the disclosures entities need to provide to enable 
users of financial statements to understand the impact on the entities’ financial performance, financial position 
and cash flows as a result of a currency being not exchangeable into another currency. An entity does not apply 
the amendments retrospectively. Instead, an entity recognises any effect of initially applying the amendments 
as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings when the entity reports foreign currency transactions. 
When an entity uses a presentation currency other than its functional currency, it recognises the cumulative 
amount of translation differences in equity.

•
 Amendments to MFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ and MFRS 128 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures’ – 
Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture resolve a 
current inconsistency between MFRS 10 and MFRS 128. The accounting treatment depends on whether the 
non-monetary assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a ‘business’. Full gain or loss 
shall be recognised by the investor where the non-monetary assets constitute a ‘business’. If the assets do not 
meet the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised by the investor to the extent of the other 
investors’ interests. The amendments will only apply when an investor sells or contributes assets to its associate 
or joint venture. They are not intended to address accounting for the sale or contribution of assets by an investor 
in a joint operation.
The Group and the Company have started a preliminary assessment on the effects of the above annual improvements 
and amendments to published standards and the impact is still being assessed, except for those have been updated 
above.
(b)
 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost also includes borrowing costs incurred for assets under 
construction. The cost of certain property, plant and equipment includes the costs of dismantling, removal and restoration, 
the obligation which was incurred as a consequence of installing the asset.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it 
is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance 
are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Where items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to the Group from customers/developers, the fair value of the 
assets transferred is recognised as property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial Position. Where the transfer 
is exchanged for connection to the network and no further obligation is required, the corresponding credit is revenue. Where 
the transfer is linked to the provision of ongoing services, the corresponding entry is deferred income as disclosed in Note 31 
and released to the Income Statement over the expected useful lives of the assets.
Infrastructure assets comprise eight components: impounding reservoirs 150 years, raw water mains 100 years, treated water 
mains 100 years, communication pipes 60 years, sewers 200 years, sewage pumping stations 60 years, combined sewer 
overflows 80 years and sea outfalls 60 years.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
Leased assets (including leasehold land) are presented as a separate line item in the Statements of Financial Position. See 
accounting policy Note 2(c)(i)b) to the financial statements on right-of-use (“ROU”) assets.

All other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of each asset to its
 
residual value over its estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:
 Years

Assets under construction are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Upon completion, assets under construction are transferred 
to categories of property, plant and equipment depending on nature of assets. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment 
under construction commences when the property, plant and equipment are ready for their intended use. Depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment ceases at the earlier of derecognition and classification as held-for-sale.
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication 
exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. A write down is made 
if the carrying amounts exceed the recoverable amounts. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on 
impairment of non-financial assets.
Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Income 
Statement.
(c)
 Leases
(i)
 Accounting by lessee
Leases are recognised as ROU asset and a corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for 
use 
by the Group and the Company (i.e. the commencement date).
Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group and the Company allocate the consideration in 
the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices.
a)
 Lease 
term
In determining the lease term, the Group and the Company consider all facts and circumstances that create an 
economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or 
periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended 
(or not to be terminated).
The Group and the Company reassess the lease term upon the occurrence of a significant event or change in 
circumstances that is within the control of the Group and the Company and affects whether the Group and the 
Company are reasonably certain to exercise an option not previously included in the determination of lease term, 
or not to exercise an option previously included in the determination of lease term. A revision in lease term results 
in remeasurement of the lease liabilities. See accounting policy (refer to d) below) on reassessment of lease liabilities.

 ROU assets
ROU assets are 
initially measured at cost comprising the following:
•
 The amount of 
the initial measurement of lease liability;
•
 Any lease payments made 
at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received;
•
 Any initial direct costs; 
and
•
 Decommissioning 
or restoration costs.
ROU assets that are not investment properties are subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment loss (if any). The ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life 
and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group and the Company are reasonably certain to exercise a 
purchase option, the ROU asset is depreciated over the underlying asset’s useful life. In addition, the ROU assets 
are adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities.
ROU assets are presented as a separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position.
c)
 Lease 
liabilities
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The 
lease payments include the following:
•
 Fixed 
payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentive receivable;
•
 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at 
the commencement date;
•
 The exercise price of extension options if the Group and the Company are reasonably certain to exercise that 
option; 
and
• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group and the Company exercising 
that option.
Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, 
which is generally the case for leases in the Group and the Company, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is 
used. This is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset 
of similar value to the ROU in a similar economic environment with similar term, security and conditions.
Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over 
the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for 
each period.
The Group and the Company present the lease liabilities as a separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position. 
Interest expense on the lease liability is presented within the finance cost in the Income Statement.

 Reassessment 
of lease liabilities
The Group and the Company are also exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend 
on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease 
payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is remeasured and adjusted against the ROU 
assets.
Lease liabilities are also remeasured if there is a change in the Group’s and the Company’s assessment of whether 
it will exercise an extension option and there are modifications in the scope or the consideration of the lease that 
was not part of the original term.
e)
 Short-term 
leases and leases of low-value assets
Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and 
small items of office furniture. Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value 
assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Income Statement.
(ii)
 Accounting by lessor
Operating leases
Assets 
leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment in the Statement of Financial 
Position. They are depreciated over their expected useful lives on a basis consistent with similar owned property, plant 
and equipment. Lease income (net of any incentives given to lessees) is recognised on the straight-line basis over the 
lease term.
Separating lease and non-lease components
If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company allocate the consideration in 
the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on the stand-alone selling prices in accordance with the 
principles in MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
(d)
 Intangible assets
(i)
 Contract rights
Contract rights comprise 
acquired contracts and rights to contracts from business combination. These are amortised over 
the contractual period on a straight-line basis and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication 
that the contract rights may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of 
non-financial assets.

Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisitions of subsidiaries and it represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the 
Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the 
fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the date of acquisition. If the fair value of consideration 
transferred, the amount of non-controlling interest and the fair value of previously held interest in the acquiree are less 
than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree, the resulting gain is recognised in the Income Statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing 
and is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and value-in-use. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently 
reversed. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
(iii)
 Software assets
Software assets comprise in-house computer software development and specialised computer software. Software assets 
are amortised over 3 to 10 years and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the software 
assets may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
Software-as-a-service arrangements are service contracts providing the right to access the cloud provider’s application 
software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to 
the cloud provider’s application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of 
the costs incurred relate to the development of software code that enhances or modifies, or creates additional capability 
to, existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of, and the recognition criteria for, an intangible asset.
(iv)
 Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise customer lists. Other intangible assets are amortised over the contractual period on a 
straight-line basis and are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the other intangible
 
assets may be impaired. See accounting policy Note 2(f) to the financial statements on impairment of non-financial assets.
(e) Investment properties
Investment properties include those portions of buildings that are held for long-term rental yields and/or for capital appreciation 
and freehold land and/or land under leases that is held for long-term capital appreciation or for a currently indeterminate use. 
Investment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised in the 
Income Statement for the period in which they arise. Where the fair value of the investment property under construction is 
not reliably determinable, the investment property under construction is measured at cost until either its fair value becomes 
reliably determinable or construction is complete, whichever is earlier.

(e) Investment properties (continued)
Cost included expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. The cost of self-constructed 
investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.
An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic 
benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset is recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which the item is derecognised. The amount of consideration to 
be included in the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of investment property is determined in accordance with the 
requirements for determining the transaction price in MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.
Transfers are made to (or from) investment property only when there is a change in use. For a transfer from investment 
property to owner-occupied property/inventories, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fair value at the date of 
change in use. If owner-occupied property becomes an investment property, the Group accounts for such property in accordance 
with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment up to the date of change in use.
(f)
 Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or as and 
when events or circumstances occur indicating that an impairment may exist. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the purposes of 
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of 
the impairment at each reporting date.
The impairment loss is charged to the Income Statement unless it reverses a previous revaluation in which case it is charged 
to the revaluation surplus. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. In respect of other assets, any subsequent increase 
in recoverable amount is recognised in the Income Statement unless it reverses impairment loss on a revalued asset in which 
case it is taken to revaluation surplus.
 
(g)
 
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when 
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting except for subsidiaries that were consolidated prior 
to 1 July 2002 in accordance with Malaysian Accounting Standard 2 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions and Mergers’, the generally 
accepted accounting principles prevailing at that time.

(g) Subsidiaries (continued)
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of 
the Group.
The gain or loss on disposal of a subsidiary is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the Group’s share of the 
subsidiary’s net assets as of the date of disposal, including the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to 
that subsidiary and is recognised in the Income Statement. The exchange difference on return of capital is reversed when 
there is no change in ownership interests.
(i)
 Acquisition method
The 
Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations when the acquired sets of activities and 
assets meet the definition of a business. The Group determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set 
of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to 
create outputs. Under the acquisition method of accounting, subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The consideration transferred 
for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests 
issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. On an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or 
at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the fair 
value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. If this consideration is lower than 
the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in the 
Income Statement (refer to significant accounting policies Note 2(d)(ii) on goodwill).
(ii)
 Merger method
Acquisition of a subsidiary, YTL 
Power Generation Sdn. Bhd., was accounted for using merger accounting principles.
Under the merger method of accounting, the results of subsidiaries are presented as if the merger had been effected 
throughout the current and previous financial years. The assets and liabilities combined are accounted for based on the 
carrying amounts from the perspective of the common control shareholder at the date of transfer. On consolidation, the 
difference between the carrying values of the investment in the subsidiary over the nominal value of the shares acquired 
is taken to merger reserve.
On consolidation, the cost of the merger is cancelled with the values of the shares received. Any resulting credit difference 
is classified as equity and regarded as a non-distributable reserve. Any resulting debit difference is adjusted against any 
suitable reserve. Any share premium, capital redemption reserve and any other reserves which are attributable to share 
capital of the merged enterprises, to the extent that they have not been capitalised by a debit difference, are reclassified 
and presented as movement in other capital reserves.

(iii)
 Transactions with non-controlling interests
T
he Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control as transactions with 
equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid 
and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses 
on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
(iv)
 Change in control
Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-
controlling interests and the other component of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the 
loss of control is recognised in the Income Statement. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then 
such 
interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity 
accounted investee or as a financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.
(h)
 
Associates
Associates are entities in which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial 
and operating policy decisions of the associates but not control over those policies.
Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements by using the equity method of accounting 
and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any 
accumulated impairment loss.
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the Income Statement and its share of post-acquisition 
movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted 
against the carrying value of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equal or exceed its interest in 
the associate, including any other unsecured obligations, the Group’s interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses 
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate.
The results of associates are taken from the most recent financial statements of the associates’ concerned, made up to dates 
not more than three months prior to the end of the financial year of the Group.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in 
the associates; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset 
transferred. Where necessary, in applying the equity method, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the associates 
to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group.
When the Group losses significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change 
in carrying amount recognised in the Income Statement. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes 
of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. Any amounts previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets 
or liabilities.

(i) Joint arrangements
A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or
 
more parties, where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of 
the parties sharing control. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the 
rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint ventures 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the joint operators have 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.
Joint ventures
The Group’s interest in a joint venture is accounted for in the financial statements by using the equity method of accounting. 
Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to 
recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses in the Income Statement and movements in reserves in 
other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equal or exceed its interests in the joint 
ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint 
ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the 
joint ventures.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in the joint ventures; unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred. Where necessary, in applying the equity method, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the 
joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group.
(j)
 Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates
Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses if any. 
Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately 
to its 
recoverable amount.
On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates, the difference between disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in the Income Statement.
(k)
 Development expenditure
Development expenditure is generally expensed when incurred otherwise it is capitalised when it meets certain criteria that 
indicate that it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits and are amortised over the period of the
 
projects. They are written down to their recoverable amounts when there is insufficient certainty that future economic benefit 
will flow to the enterprise.

(l) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average or first-in, fir
st-
out basis. Inventories comprise primarily of raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, fuel and spare parts. The cost of 
work-in-progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and an appropriate share of overheads based on 
normal operating capacity. It excludes borrowing costs. Fuel and diesel oil held for generation of electricity are not written 
down below cost if the electricity generated is expected to obtain a gross margin at or above cost. Cost for this purpose 
includes the applicable costs required to enable the fuel and diesel oil to be used for the generation of electricity.
Inventories for oil trading are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations 
in price. These are at fair value less costs to sell, with changes in fair value less costs to sell recognised in the Income Statement 
in the period of change.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion 
and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Classification
The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following measurement categories:
• those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (“OCI”) or through profit 
or loss), and
•
 those 
to be measured at amortised cost
The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of 
the cash flows.
The Group and the Company reclassify debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those 
assets changes.
The Group and the Company irrevocably elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI. The 
Group and the Company consider this classification to be more relevant as these instruments are strategic investments 
of the Group and the Company and not held for trading purposes.
(ii)
 Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group and the 
Company commit to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows 
from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred
 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

 Measurement
At initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition 
of the 
financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the Income Statement.
Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows 
are solely payment of principal and interest (“SPPI”).
a)
 Debt instruments
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s and the Company’s business model for
 
managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.
There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify their debt instruments:
•
 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent 
S
PPI are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in the Income 
Statement using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised 
directly in the Income Statement and presented in other operating income/(expenses) together with foreign 
exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the Income Statement.
•
 Fair value 
through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”): Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash 
flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. 
Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or 
losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the Income Statement. 
When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified 
from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other operating income/(expenses). Interest income from these 
financial assets is included in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange 
gains and losses are presented in other operating income/(expenses) and impairment expenses are presented 
as separate line item in the Income Statement.
•
 FVTPL: 
Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. The Group and 
the Company may also irrevocably designate financial assets at FVTPL if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates 
a mismatch created by assets and liabilities being measured on different bases. Fair value changes are recognised 
in the Income Statement and presented net within other operating income/(expenses) in the period which it 
arises.

instruments
The Group and the Company subsequently measure all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s and the 
Company’s management have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is 
no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the 
investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in the Income Statement when the Group’s 
and the Company’s right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are recognised in other operating income/(expenses) in the 
Income Statement as applicable.
(iv)
 
Impairment
The Group and the Company assess on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss (“ECL”) associated with its debt 
instruments carried at amortised cost and at FVOCI and financial guarantee contracts issued. The impairment methodology 
applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
The Group has six types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
•
 Trade 
receivables
•
 Unbilled 
receivables
•
 Contract assets
•
 Other 
receivables (including deposits, interest receivables and receivables from associate/joint venture)
• A mounts owing by related companies (fellow subsidiaries, immediate holding company and ultimate holding company)
• Financial guarantee contracts
The 
Company has three types of financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:
•
 Other 
receivables (including deposits and interest receivables)
• Amounts owing by related companies (fellow subsidiaries, immediate holding company, ultimate holding company and 
subsidiaries)
•
 Financial guarantee contracts
While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”, the 
identified 
impairment loss was immaterial.

 Impairment (continued)
ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between present value of cash flows according to the 
contract and 
present value of cash flows the Group and the Company expect to receive, over the remaining life of the 
financial instrument. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to 
reimburse the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Group and the Company expect to 
receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.
The measurement of ECL reflects:
•
 an 
unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;
•
 the 
time value of money; and
•
 reasonable 
and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about 
past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
a)
 General 
3-stage approach for other receivables and financial guarantee contracts issued
At each reporting date, the Group and the Company measure ECL through loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 
month ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly 
since initial recognition. For all other financial instruments, a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL is 
required. Note 35(b) sets out the measurement details of ECL.
b) Simplified approach for trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related
 
companies which is trade in nature
The Group applies the MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” simplified approach to measure ECL which uses a lifetime ECL 
for all trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is 
trade in nature. Note 35(b) sets out the measurement details of ECL.
Significant increase in credit risk
The Group and the Company consider the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has 
been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there 
is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group and the Company compare the risk of a default occurring on the asset 
as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group and the Company consider 
available reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.

 Impairment (continued)
Significant increase in credit risk (continued)
The 
following indicators are incorporated:
•
 external credit 
rating (as far as available)
• actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to
 
cause a significant change to the debtor’s ability to meet its obligations
• significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the debtor, including changes in the payment
 
status of debtor in the Group and changes in the operating results of the debtor.
Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past 
due in making a contractual payment.
Definition of default and credit-impaired financial assets
The Group and the Company define a financial instrument as default, which is fully aligned with the definition of credit-
impaired, when it meets one or more of the following criteria:
a)
 Quantitative criteria
The Group and the Company define a financial instrument as default, when the counterparty fails to make contractual 
payment within 80 and 365 days of when they fall due.
b)
 Qualitative criteria
The debtor meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the debtor is in significant financial difficulty. The
 
Group and the Company consider the following instances:
•
 the debtor is in 
breach of financial covenants
•
 concessions 
have been made by the lender relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty
•
 it is 
becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation
•
 the debtor is insolvent
Financial instruments that are credit-impaired 
are assessed on individual basis.

Groupings of instruments for ECL measured on collective basis
a)
 Collective assessment
To measure ECL, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies 
which is trade in nature have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics of customer’s behaviour and 
the days past due. The unbilled receivables, contract assets relate to unbilled amounts and amounts owing by related 
companies which is trade in nature have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the 
same types of contracts. The Group has therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are 
a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by 
related companies which is trade in nature.
b)
 Individual assessment
Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, other receivables and amounts owing by related companies 
which 
are in default or credit-impaired are assessed individually.
(v)
 Write-off
a)
 Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in 
nature
Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in 
nature are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the 
Group, 
uneconomic collection and court orders.
Impairment losses are presented within ‘cost of sales’ in the Income Statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the same line item.
b)
 Other 
receivables and amounts owing by related companies
The Group and the Company write-off financial assets, in whole or in part, when the Group and the Company have 
exhausted all practical recovery efforts and have concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The 
assessment of no reasonable expectation of recovery is based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or 
assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount. The Group and the Company may write-off 
financial assets that are still subject to enforcement activity. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off will result in impairment gains.

(m) Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued)
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Group and the Company 
become 
a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade payables, other payables and borrowings (see Note 2(r)). The Company’s financial 
liabilities include other payables and borrowings (see Note 2(r)). These are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction 
costs incurred, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. When an existing financial liability 
is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new 
liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Income Statement.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when there is 
a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must 
be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.
(n)
 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-
measured at their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is
 
designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates its hedges as cash 
flow hedges. Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
in the Income Statement when the changes arise.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, 
as well as its risk management objective and strategies for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents 
its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives designated as hedging instruments 
are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in Note 20 to the financial 
statements. Movements on the hedging reserve in shareholders’ equity are shown in Note 25(a) to the financial statements. 
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is 
less than 12 months. The fair value of a trading derivative is classified as a current asset or liability.

(n) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (continued)
The fair value changes on the effective portion of the derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is
 
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in 
the Income Statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to Income Statement in the financial periods when the hedged item affects 
Income Statement (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). When the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously 
deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, 
plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately 
recognised in the Income Statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss 
that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement.
(o)
 Financial guarantee
Financial guarantee 
contracts are contracts that require the Group and the Company to make specified payments to reimburse 
the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of 
a debt instrument.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially 
measured at fair value.
The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the 
contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without guarantee, or the estimated 
amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.
Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with the 
expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount 
of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, where appropriate.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, cash at bank and deposits 
held at call with financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known
 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are 
included within borrowings in current liabilities on the Statement of Financial Position.

(q) Share capital
Ordinary shares and non-redeemable preference shares with discretionary dividends are classified as equity. Other shares are 
classified 
as equity and/or liability according to the substance of the contractual arrangement of the particular instrument.
Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings and accrued 
as liability in the financial year in which the obligation to pay is established.
Purchase of own shares
Where the Company purchases its own shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, 
net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the Company as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled, 
reissued.
Should such shares be cancelled, the costs of the treasury shares are applied in the reduction of the profits otherwise available 
for distribution as dividends. Should such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the 
Company.
Where the treasury shares are subsequently distributed as dividends to shareholders, the costs of the treasury shares are 
applied in the reduction of the funds otherwise available for distribution as dividends.
(r)
 
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, borrowings are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method; any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the term of the borrowings.
Interest relating to a financial instrument classified as a liability is reported within finance cost in the Income Statement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement 
of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
Borrowing cost incurred to finance the construction of property, plant and equipment that meets the definition of qualifying 
asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets during the period of time that is required to get ready the asset for its 
intended use.
(s)
 Grants and contributions
Grants and contributions are benefits received in respect of specific qualifying expenditure, and investment tax credits and 
tax benefits in respect of qualifying property, plant and equipment. These are released to the Income Statement over the
 
expected economic useful lives of the related assets.

(t) Deferred income
The deferred income comprise assets transferred from customers in respect of services which are yet to be provided and
 
shareholder loan interest revenue. Such amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and are 
amortised to the Income Statement over the expected economic useful lives of the related assets.
(u)
 
Provisions
The Group and the Company recognise provisions when it has a present legal or constructive obligation arising as a result of 
a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable 
estimate of the amount can be made. The recording of provisions requires the application of judgements about the ultimate 
resolution of these obligations. As a result, provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the Group’s 
and the Company’s current best estimate.
(v)
 Revenue recognition
Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group’s ordinary activities is recognised by reference to each 
distinct performance 
obligation promised in the contract with customer. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured 
at its transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
promised goods or services to a customer, net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Transaction price is 
allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services 
promised in the contract. Depending on the substances of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised 
when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time.
(i)
 Sale of electricity
The Group’s electricity is generated and sold into national electricity company or market in the respective countries in 
which 
the Group operates.
Revenue from the sale of electricity is recognised over time as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits 
provided by the Group’s performance when electricity is delivered based on contractual terms stipulated in respective 
agreements with customers.
Revenue is presented, net of goods and service tax, penalties, rebates and discounts. Collection of the contract consideration 
from customers is considered probable. No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has adopted the practical 
expedient available in MFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (“MFRS 15”) where the interval between transfer 
of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer is expected to be less than 12 months.
Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customer from the date of the last meter 
reading available and reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenue is recognised as receivables and is reversed in the 
following month when actual billings occur.

(ii)
 Supply of clean water and treatment and disposal of waste water
The Group, under the license granted by the UK Government, has the right to supply water and sewerage services to 
customers, together 
with an obligation to maintain and develop the network and ensure its continued availability.
The nature of the water industry in the UK is such that revenue recognition is subject to a degree of estimation. The 
assessment of water sales to customers is based on internal data where final settlement data is not yet available. At the 
end of each period, amounts of water delivered to customers are estimated and the corresponding billed and unbilled 
revenue is assessed and recorded in revenue. For the purpose of the judgement, various factors are considered such as 
seasonality, historic billing profiles, leakage data and general economic conditions.
For metered customers, revenue is determined by the meter reading. For unmetered customers, the amount to which 
the Group has a right to receive is determined by the passage of time during which the customer occupies a property 
within the Group’s licensed region. Revenue represents income receivable in the ordinary course of business, excluding 
Value Added Tax, for services provided. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits 
will flow to the Group.
Unbilled receivables are considered to be a variable consideration which is not constrained as the Group considers it to 
be highly probable that a significant amount will not be reversed after year end. Unbilled receivables and the variable 
consideration are estimated using the most likely outcome approach.
Developer services related to the obligation under statute to allow property developers to establish an authorised 
connection to the water and/or sewerage network. In obtaining the connection, the developer may require the Group to 
undertake one or more of the following:
(i)
 Connections and 
meter installation in exchange for payment;
(ii)
 Requisitions of water mains 
in exchange for payment; and
(iii)
 Adoptions 
of water and wastewater mains.
The developer is also required to pay infrastructure charges being a contribution to network reinforcement.
These activities are not separable nor distinct and instead form a bundle of activities necessary to establish an authorised 
connection from which the network access can be obtained. Also, the Group has an additional obligation under statute 
to keep the connection in place for all current and future occupiers and facilitate ongoing access to the network for as 
long as the property requires service provision. Consequently, revenue from developer services will be deferred over the 
shorter of expected period of service provision or the need to replace the assets at the end of their useful life (typically 
in the range 60 to 125 years). No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has adopted the practical expedient 
available in MFRS 15 where the interval between transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer 
is expected to be less than 12 months.

(iii)
 Telecommunications
The Group generates revenue from providing telecommunication services, such as access to the network, airtime usage, 
messaging, and internet services as well as from sales of products. Products and services may be sold separately or in 
bundled 
packages. The typical length of a contract for bundled packages is 11 months to 24 months.
For bundled packages, the Group accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, i.e. if a 
product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from 
it. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their Relative Stand-alone 
Selling Prices (“RSSP”). The RSSP are determined based on the list prices at which the Group sells the products and 
telecommunication services. RSSP are based on observable sales prices; however, where RSSP are not directly observable, 
estimates will be made maximising the use of observable inputs.
a)
 Telecommunication 
services
Telecommunication revenue from postpaid and prepaid services provided by the Group is recognised over time, as 
the benefits of telecommunication services are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer.
Revenue from prepaid services is recognised when services are rendered. Starter packs with a sim card and reload 
voucher is accounted for as a single performance obligation as the sim card can only be used together with the 
services provided by the Group. Prepaid credits are recognised as contract liability in the Statement of Financial 
Position. Revenue is recognised when the credits are utilised or up to the point of customer churn or upon expiry, 
whichever is earlier.
Postpaid services are provided in postpaid packages which consist of various services (i.e. call minutes, internet data, 
sms and etc.). As the services are separately identifiable and the customers can benefit from each of the services 
on its own, each service is accounted for as a separate performance obligation.
Postpaid packages are either sold separately or bundled together with the sale of device to a customer. As postpaid 
packages and device are capable of being distinct and separately identifiable, there are two performance obligations 
within a bundled transaction. Accordingly, the Group allocates the transaction price based on the RSSP of the postpaid 
packages and devices.
b)
 Sale 
of devices
Devices may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The Group recognises revenue when control of the device 
has transferred to the customer upon delivery and acceptance of the device at the point of sale.
For devices sold separately, the consideration is received in full at the point of sale. The amount of revenue recognised 
is measured at the consideration specified in the contract. For devices sold in bundled packages, the customers 
usually offered to pay at a discounted price on the device. The amount of revenue recognised for devices sold in 
bundled packages is measured at the allocated consideration based on the RSSP as explained previously.

 Sale 
of devices (continued)
Devices that the Group promises to transfer as part of a bundled package with network service plans are considered 
distinct and thus accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Devices that are transferred as part of a fixed 
line telecommunication services bundled package which can only be used together with the services provided by 
the Group, are considered as a single performance obligation in telecommunications service revenue.
A contract asset is recognised when the Group delivers the devices before the payment is due. If the payment 
happens before delivery of device, then a contract liability is recognised. Contract assets and contract liabilities are 
presented within receivables and payables respectively in the Statement of Financial Position.
The Group generates revenue from telecommunication infrastructure. Telecommunication infrastructure revenue is 
generated from the leasing of space on the Group’s telecommunication towers, where the customers install and maintain 
their individual communication network equipment, and from construction of telecommunication infrastructure. The leasing 
revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the fixed and non-cancellable term of the lease agreement, irrespective 
of when payments are due. For the construction of telecommunication infrastructure, see accounting policy Note 2(vii) 
to the financial statements on construction contracts.
(iv)
 Sale of steam
The 
Group’s sale of steam is mainly derived from wholesale market customers. Revenue from sale of steam is recognised 
as and when the Group’s customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits (i.e. the customers are able to 
utilise the steam for their benefit as and when the steam is being supplied) arising from the Group performing its 
obligations based on the terms of the contracts with the customers. Accordingly, revenue from the supply of steam is 
recognised over time; i.e. as and when the steam supplied is consumed by the customers.
No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has adopted the practical expedient available in MFRS 15 where 
the interval between transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer is expected to be less 
than 12 months.
(v)
 Investment income
Investment income earned 
by the Group and the Company are recognised on the following bases:
Dividend income – When the shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Interest income – On an effective interest basis.
(vi)
 Lease income
Lease 
income earned by the Group is recognised on the following bases:
Tank leasing fees – Tank leasing fees from operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.
Rental income – Rental income from operating leases (net of any incentive given to the lessees) is 
recognised on the straight-line basis over the lease term.

(vii)
 Construction 
contracts
Under such contracts, the Group is engaged to construct buildings and related infrastructure and in certain instances to 
supply equipments. These contracts may include multiple promises to the customers and therefore accounted for as 
separate performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated based on relative stand-alone selling 
price of the considerations of each of the separate performance obligations. When these are not directly observable, they 
are estimated based on expected cost plus margin.
Revenue from construction contracts is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the agreement.
The Group determines the transaction price of a contract after considering the effect of variable consideration, constraining 
estimates of variable consideration, effect of significant financing component, non-cash consideration and consideration 
payable to customer.
When the fair value of variable consideration is uncertain, the Group estimates the amount of consideration by using the 
most likely amount method and only recognises to the extent that is highly probable that a significant reversal in cumulative 
revenue will not occur.
Revenue is recognised as and when control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group 
would collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that would be transferred to the 
customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may 
transfer over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the performance of the Group 
does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for 
performance completed to date.
If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the 
progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation using the input method, which is based on the 
total actual construction cost incurred to date as compared to the total budgeted costs to the respective construction 
projects.
If control of the asset transfers at a point in time, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains 
control of the asset.

Others
Other income earned by the Group is recognised on the following bases:
Sale of natural gas – Revenue from sale of natural gas is recognised as and when the Group’s customers 
simultaneously receive and consume the benefits (i.e. the customers are able to utilise 
the gas for their benefit as and when the gas is being supplied) arising from the Group 
performing its obligations based on the terms of the contracts with the customers. 
Accordingly, revenue from the supply of gas is recognised over time; i.e. as and when 
the gas supplied is consumed by the customers. No element of financing is deemed 
present as the Group has adopted the practical expedient available in MFRS 15 where 
the interval between transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the 
customer is expected to be less than 12 months.
Sale of fuel oil – Sale of fuel oil is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when 
the products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that 
could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the 
products have been transported to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and 
loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the 
products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, 
or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.
– Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract 
and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant 
reversal will not occur. No element of financing is deemed present as the Group has 
adopted the practical expedient available in MFRS 15 where the interval between 
transfer of the promised goods or services and payment by the customer is expected 
to be less than 12 months. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as 
this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage 
of time is required before the payment is due.
Management, operation  
and maintenance fees
– Management, operation and maintenance fees are recognised over the period in which 
the services are rendered.
Hotel operations – Hotel room revenue is recognised over time during the period of stay for the hotel 
guests. Revenue from food, beverage and other ancillary services are generally recognised 
at the point in time when the services are rendered.

(w) Contracts with Customers
(i)
 Contract assets
C
ontract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods and services that the Group has transferred to a 
customer. If the Group transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject 
to impairment assessment based on the ECL model. Contract assets are presented within “Receivables, deposits and 
prepayments” of the Statement of Financial Position.
(ii)
 Contract liabilities
Contract liability is the unsatisfied obligation by the Group to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the
 
Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration 
before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made 
or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs the 
services under the contract. Contract liabilities are presented within “Payables and accrued expenses” and “Payables” of 
the Statement of Financial Position.
(iii)
 Contract cost assets
The Group capitalises sales commissions as costs to obtain a contract with a customer when they are incremental and 
expected to be recovered more than a year. The Group expects to recover these costs in the future through telecommunication 
services revenue earned from the customer. The Group also capitalises the expenditure on assets such as water mains/
sewers or new connections relating to contracts as they are incurred to fulfil the contract.
Sales commissions are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the specific contract to which the cost relates 
to. Amortisation of contract costs are included as part of direct cost within “Cost of sales” in the Income Statement. While, 
the expenditure on assets are treated as cost of sales when the contract is complete.
An impairment loss is recognised to the Income Statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost 
asset recognised exceeds the remaining amount of considerations that the Group expects to receive for the specific 
contract that the cost relates to less additional costs required to complete the specific contract.
(x)

(x) Employee benefits (continued)
(ii)
 Post-employment benefits (continued)
These 
benefit plans are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans.
a)
 Defined 
contribution plan
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into 
a separate entity (a fund) on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and will have no legal or constructive 
obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits 
relating to employee service in the current and prior financial periods.
The Group’s and the Company’s contributions to defined contribution plan are charged to the Income Statement in 
the financial period to which they relate.
b)
 Defined 
benefit plan
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a 
function of one or more factors such as age, years of service or compensation.
The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting 
date minus the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows 
using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will 
be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Re-measurement gains and losses of post-employment benefit obligations are recognised in Other Comprehensive 
Income.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
(iii)
 Share-based compensation
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based compensation plan for the employees of the Group. The fair value of 
the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share options is recognised as an expense in the Income 
Statement over the 
vesting periods of the grant with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options 
granted and the number of share options to be vested by vesting date. At each reporting date, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision of original 
estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. For options granted to subsidiaries, 
the expense will be recognised in the subsidiaries’ financial statements over the vesting periods of the grant.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital when the options 
are exercised.

(y) Income taxes
Current tax expense is determined according to the tax laws of each jurisdiction in which the Group operates and includes all 
taxes based upon the taxable profits, including withholding taxes payable by a foreign subsidiary, associated company or joint 
venture 
on distributions of retained earnings to companies in the Group.
Deferred tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the amounts attributed 
to assets and liabilities for tax purposes and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax is not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that 
at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint 
ventures except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Group’s share of income taxes of joint ventures and associates are included in the Group’s share of profits of investments 
accounted for using the equity method.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability is settled.
(z)
 Foreign currencies
(i)
 Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
e
conomic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial statements 
are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency.
(ii)
 Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates 
of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the 
translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the Income Statement.

(z) Foreign currencies (continued)
(iii)
 Group companies
The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) 
that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency 
as follows:
•
 assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date 
of that 
Statement of Financial Position;
•
 income 
and expenses for each Income Statement are translated at average exchange rates; and
•
 all resulting exchange 
differences are recognised as a separate component of other comprehensive income.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken 
to shareholder’s equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of or sold, such exchange differences that were recorded 
in shareholders’ equity are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity on or after 1 July 2011 are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. For acquisition of foreign entities completed 
prior to 1 July 2011, goodwill and fair value adjustments continued to be recorded at the exchange rate at the respective 
date of acquisitions. This is in accordance to the adoption of MFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of Malaysian Financial Reporting 
Standards”.
(aa)
 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
The Group and the Company do not recognise a contingent liability but disclose its existence in the financial statements, except 
in a business combination.
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence 
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and the Company or a present 
obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation 
or it cannot be measured reliably. However, contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and the Company. The Group and 
the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose their existence where inflows of economic benefits are probable, 
but not virtually certain.
In the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group under a business combination, the contingent liabilities assumed are measured 
initially at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests.
The Group recognises separately the contingent liabilities of the acquirees as part of allocating the cost of a business combination 
where the fair values can be measured reliably. Where the fair values cannot be measured reliably, the resulting effect will be 
reflected in the goodwill arising from the acquisitions.

(ab) Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating  
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of 
the operating segments, has been identified as the Executive Director primarily responsible for the financial statements of 
the Group.
Transactions between segments are carried out on mutually agreed basis. The effects of such inter-segment transactions are 
eliminated on consolidation. The measurement basis and classification are consistent with those adopted in the previous 
financial year.
3. C RITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations 
of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by 
definition, rarely equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:
(a)
 Impairment assessment of goodwill
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, in accordance with its accounting policy. The recoverable amounts of cash-
generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of significant 
judgements and 
estimates as set out in Note 13 to the financial statements.
(b)
 Capitalisation of infrastructure assets in property, plant and equipment
Due to the high value of capital expenditure on infrastructure assets, judgements made on the classification of expenses as 
operating or capital, and within capital between maintenance and enhancement, are key to the preparation of the accounts. 
These judgements are based on engineering 
experience of differentiating between treatment as a repair or a replacement of 
an infrastructure asset.
(c)
 Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and investment
The Group assesses impairment of the assets or cash-generating units (“CGUs”) whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable i.e. the carrying amount of the asset is more 
than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) 
for that asset or CGU and its value-in-use (“VIU”). Projected future cash flows used in impairment testing of the assets or CGU
s 
are based on Group’s estimates calculated using historical, sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, 
changes in technology and other available information.

3. C RITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(c) Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) and investment (continued)
The recoverable amounts of the asset or CGUs are determined based on VIU or FVLCD calculations. These calculations require 
the use of estimates. The calculations are inherently judgemental and susceptible to change from period to period because 
they require 
the Group to make assumptions about revenue growth rate, discount rate and terminal multiple.
The assumptions used and results of the impairment assessment of investment in a subsidiary and PPE are disclosed in Note 
14(c) and Note 10 to the financial statements, respectively.
(d)
 Assessment on allowance for impairment of trade receivables of water and sewerage segment
The expected credit loss on outstanding receivables is a key estimate under MFRS 9. The Group estimate of recoverability by 
grouping 
customers into similar economic profiles and applying a percentage loss rate based on forward-looking judgements 
on the future collection rates that are likely to be achieved. This has included additional considerations of the possible impact 
of the ongoing economic uncertainty on the expected collection rates of outstanding receivables. A 1% reduction in collection 
rates would increase the expected credit loss allowance by RM28.7 million.
(e)
 Estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment
The Group reviews the 
useful lives of its PPE at each reporting date and any adjustments are made on a prospective basis as 
changes in accounting estimates. The useful lives of the PPE are assessed periodically based on the conditions of the equipment, 
market conditions and other regulatory requirements. A change in accounting estimates in the current financial year is disclosed 
in Note 10 to the financial statements.
(f)
 Assumptions used in determining the post-employment benefit plans
The present value of the post-employment benefit plans depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial 
basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income are disclosed in Note 29 to 
the financial statements. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of post-employment benefit plans.
(g) Revenue recognition from accrued income
The unbilled income accrual from metered water services of the water and sewerage segment requires an estimation of the 
amount of unbilled charges at the period end. This is calculated using system generated information based on previous customer 
volume usage. A 2% movement in average consumption equates to a RM5.4 million movement in the unbilled income accrual.
(h)
 
Leases
The measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability for leases where the Group is a lessee requires the use of 
significant judgements and assumptions, such as lease term and incremental borrowing rate.
In determining the lease term, the Group and the Company consider all facts and circumstances that create an economic 
incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension option (or periods after termination 
options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). The lease 
term is reassessed if an option is exercised (or not exercised) or the Group and the Company become obligated to exercise 
(not to exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances occurred, which affect this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee.

3. C RITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)
(h) Leases (continued)
In determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Group and the Company first determine the closest borrowing rate before 
using significant judgement to determine the adjustments required to reflect the term, security, value or economic environmental 
of the respective leases.
(i)
 Investment properties
The Group carries its investment properties at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in the Income Statements. 
For investment properties, a valuation methodology is adopted which involves comparison to developments of a similar nature, 
location and condition. The sensitivity analysis is disclosed in Note 12(b) to the financial statements.
(j)
 Deferred tax assets
Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which 
temporary differences can be utilised. This involves judgment regarding future financial performance of respective entities 
when the deferred tax assets are recognised.

Under the Malaysia Finance Act 2018 which was gazetted on 27 December 2018, the Group’s unutilised tax losses in Malaysia 
tax entities with no expiry period will be imposed with a time limit of utilisation. Any accumulated unutilised tax losses brought 
forward from year of assessment 2018 can be carried forward for another 7 consecutive years of assessment. The Malaysia 
Finance Act 2021 has subsequently extended the utilisation period to 10 years. With that, the expiry dates of the Group’s tax 
losses (after tax effects) are summarised below:

The Group has undistributed earnings from subsidiaries incorporated outside Malaysia, could be subject to tax if distributed.  
An assessable temporary difference exists, but no deferred tax liability has been recognised as the Group is able to control the 
timing of distributions from these subsidiaries and is not expected to distribute these profits in the foreseeable future.

and as a result, the depreciation charge for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 decreased by RM31.9 million. Assuming the assets are held until the end of their estimated useful lives, depreciation in relation to these assets will be decreased by approximate RM124.6 million per annum.

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of a subsidiary
The recoverable amount of the PPE assessed as part of a cash generating unit (“CGU”) is determined based on the fair value less 
costs of disposal (“FVLCD”) calculation.
The following are the key assumptions applied in the FVLCD calculation for impairment assessment of PPE of a subsidiary in the 
telecommunications segment:
2023 2022
Discount rate 9.2% 9.1%
Average service revenue growth rate 49.4% 18.4%
Terminal year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”) margin 26.7% 31.4%
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is derived from the cost of capital at the date of the assessment.
The cash flow projections used in the FVLCD calculation were based on approved financial budgets and forecasts covering a 5 year 
period, adjusted to reflect market participants assumptions. Cash flows beyond the 5 year period were extrapolated a further 12 
(2022: 13) years representing the estimated useful lives of the PPE of the subsidiary, using the estimated long-term growth rate 
of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%).

Impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) of a subsidiary (continued)
Fair value is held within Level 3 in fair value hierarchy disclosures.
The carrying amount of the CGU as at 30 June 2023 is RM2.3 billion (2022: RM2.4 billion). No impairment charge was recognised as 
the recoverable amount of the CGU was in excess of its carrying amount.
If the discount rate increased by 4% (2022: 4%), the carrying value will be reduced by approximate RM68 million (2022: RM168 
million). If the average service revenue growth rate reduced by 2% (2022: 2%), the carrying value will be reduced by approximate 
RM74 million (2022: RM150 million). And, if the terminal year EBITDA margin reduced by 7% (2022: 8%), the carrying value will be 
reduced by approximate RM21 million (2022: RM76 million).

(a) Impairment test for goodwill
The Group 
undertakes an annual test for impairment of its cash-generating units (“CGUs”).
Goodwill is allocated for impairment test to the individual entity which is also the CGUs identified according to the respective 
companies.
The following CGUs, being the lowest level of asset for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, have carrying 
amounts of goodwill that are considered significant in comparison with the Group’s total goodwill:

Others 146,821 138,809
Total goodwill 9,063,388 8,352,840
The amount of goodwill initially recognised is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, 
to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement.
(i)
 Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations
The following 
assumptions have been applied in the value-in-use calculation:
2023 2022
Singapore
%
UK
%
Singapore

Discount rate 6.53 2.96 6.52 3.02
Terminal growth rate 2.00 3.29 2.00 1.48
Revenue growth rate 3.37 4.39 1.95 (0.17)
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations 
apply a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by 
management.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU. The discount rates applied to the cash 
flow projections are derived from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium at the date of the assessment of 
the respective CGU.

(a) Impairment test for goodwill (continued)
(i)
 Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations (continued)
For power generation segment (“Singapore”), cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculation were based on 
ap
proved financial budgets and forecasts covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period were 
extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated above. The growth rate did not exceed the long-term average 
growth rate in which the CGU operates.
The terminal growth rate indicates the expected growth of cash flows after the forecast period of five years.
The revenue growth rate is calculated using the Compound Annual Growth Rate method and applied on the current year’s 
sales figures over the forecast period.
For water and sewerage segment (“UK”), cash flow projections used in the value-in-use calculation were based on approved 
financial budgets and forecasts covering a two-year (2022: three-year) period, to conform the final determinations 
approved by OFWAT, the economic regulator of the water sector in England and Wales.
(ii)
 Impact of possible change in key assumptions
The circumstances where a change in key assumptions will result in the recoverable amounts of goodwill on the CGUs 
to equal the corresponding 
carrying amounts assuming no change in the other variables are as follows:
2023 2022

Based on the above assessment, no impairment charge for the goodwill was recognised for the financial year ended 30 
June 2023 (2022: Nil) as the recoverable amount of the CGUs was in excess of its carrying amount.

transactions are transferred to the inventory of fuel upon acquisition or cost of sales upon consumption of natural gas. The gains 
and losses relating to fuel oil inventory are subsequently recognised in the Income Statement upon consumption of the underlying 
fuel.
The fair value of fuel oil swaps is determined using a benchmark fuel price index at the reporting date.
(b)
 Currency forwards
Currency forwards are entered into to hedge highly probable forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency expected 
to occur at various 
dates within 1 to 31 months (2022: 1 to 31 months) from financial year end. The currency forwards have 
maturity dates that match the expected occurrence of these transactions.
Gains and losses relating to highly probable forecast fuel payments are recognised in the hedging reserve prior to the occurrence 
of these transactions and are transferred to the inventory of fuel upon acquisition or cost of sales upon consumption of natural 
gas. The gains and losses relating to fuel oil inventory are subsequently transferred to Income Statement upon consumption 
of the underlying fuel.
For those currency forwards used to hedge highly probable forecast foreign currency payments of purchases of property, plant 
and equipment, the gains and losses are included in the cost of the assets and recognised in the Income Statement over their 
estimated useful lives as part of depreciation expense.
For those currency forwards used to hedge highly probable forecast foreign currency transactions for maintenance contracts, 
the gains and losses are included in payments and recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the contracts.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting 
date.
(c)
 Electricity futures
During the previous financial year, electricity futures are entered into to hedge highly probable forecast sale of electricity 
that 
are expected to occur at various dates within 6 months from financial year end. The electricity futures have maturity dates 
that match the expected occurrence of these transactions. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve prior to the 
occurrence of these transactions are transferred to the Income Statement upon sale of the electricity.
The fair value of electricity futures is determined with reference to the Uniform Singapore Energy Price (“USEP”) monthly and 
quarterly base load electricity futures prices quoted on Singapore Exchange (“SGX”).

Expected volatility 26.50% – 28.52%
Expected dividend yield 5.16% – 6.63%
Expected option life 5.62 years – 5.94 years
Risk-free interest rate per annum (based on Malaysian securities bonds) 2.83% – 3.49%

(b) Defined benefit plan – United Kingdom
A subsidiary of the Group operates final salary defined benefit plans for its employees in the United Kingdom, the assets of 
which are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The latest actuarial valuation of the plan was undertaken by a qualified 
actuary as at 30 September 2022. This valuation has been adjusted to the reporting date as at 30 June 2023 taking account 
of experience over the period since 30 September 2022, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and 
demographic assumptions by the qualified actuary.
(i)
 Profile of the scheme
The defined benefit obligations include benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners. Broadly, 
about 24% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 14% to former employees and 62% to current 
pensioners.
The scheme duration is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefit payments are made. For the scheme as 
a whole, the duration is around 13-14 years reflecting the approximate split of the defined benefit obligation between 
current employees (duration of c18-19 years), deferred members (duration of c17-18 years) and current pensioners 
(duration of c10-11 years).
(ii)
 Funding requirements
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently. The last funding valuation report, 30 September 2022 
showed a deficit of GBP35.3 million (RM208.4 million).
The subsidiary is due to pay deficit contributions of up to GBP20.2 million (RM119.3 million) by 1 July 2024, with the 
amount falling due dependent upon the scheme’s funding position ahead of the payment date which, along with investment 
returns from return-seeking assets, are expected to make good this shortfall by 1 July 2024.
The subsidiary also pays contributions of 15.5% of pensionable salaries in respect of current accrual and non-investment 
related expenses. A contribution of GBP18.4 million (RM108.6 million) was paid on 30 June 2023.
(iii)
 Risk associated with the scheme
Asset volatility – The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform 
this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth assets (equities 
including a diversified growth fund and a global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure 
it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields – A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the scheme’s liabilities for 
accounting purposes, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.

(iii)
 Risk associated with the scheme (continued)
Inflation risk – The majority of the scheme’s benefit obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation will lead to 
higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme 
inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an 
increase in inflation will also increase the deficit.
Life expectancy – The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases 
in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.
The trustees insure certain benefits payables on death before retirement.

35. F INANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s and the Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (comprising of foreign currency 
exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk. The Group’s and the Company’s overall 
financial risk management objective is to ensure that adequate resources are available to create value for its shareholders. The 
Group and the Company focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the 
financial performance of the Group and the Company.

(a) Market risk
(i)
 Foreign currency exchange risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate 
because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Group and the Company are exposed to risks arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the 
United States Dollar (“USD”). Where necessary, the Group enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to 
limit its exposure on foreign currency receivables and payables and on cash flows generated from anticipated transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies.
The following table demonstrates the impact to the Group’s and the Company’s profit after tax and equity to strengthening/
weakening of USD, with all other variables held constant.

(ii)
 Interest rate risk
Interest rate exposure arises from the Group’s and the Company’s borrowings, deposits, short-term investments and
 
interest-bearing advances to subsidiaries of the Company. This exposure is managed through the use of fixed and floating 
rate debts, as well as through derivative financial instruments, where appropriate, to generate the desired interest rate 
profile.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group’s and the Company’s cash flows to interest rate risk. However, this 
is partially offset by the interest income accruing on fixed deposits and income funds.

At the reporting date, if annual interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower respectively, with all other variables 
in particular foreign exchange rates and tax rates being held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s profit after tax 
and equity will be lower/higher by RM54.8 million (2022: RM57.7 million) and RM6.4 million (2022: RM4.6 million), 
respectively as a result of increase/decrease in interest expense on these variable rate borrowings.
The Group and the Company manage their liquidity risks by placing excess funds of the Group and the Company in bank 
deposits and other highly liquid investments to match its cash flow needs. If interest deposit rates increased/decreased 
by 10 basis points, interest income for the Group and the Company for the financial year would increase/decrease by 
RM8.0 million (2022: RM5.3 million) and RM1.5 million (2022: RM1.4 million), respectively.
(iii)
 Price risk
Investments
The Group and the Company are exposed to equity securities and income funds price risk arising from investments held 
which are classified on the Statement of Financial Position either as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive 
income (“FVTOCI”) or financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”).
To manage its price risk arising from investments in equity securities, the Group and the Company diversify their portfolio. 
For income funds, the Group and the Company mainly invest in AAA rated bonds. This investment is meant to achieve 
better yield as compared to fixed deposits. At the reporting date, if the prices of the income funds at FVTPL increased/
decreased by 1% (2022: 1%) with all other variables including tax rate being held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s 
profit after tax and equity will be higher/lower by RM12.4 million (2022: RM7.4 million) and RM4.2 million (2022: RM Nil), 
respectively.

 Price risk (continued)
Fuel commodity price risk
The Group hedges its fuel commodity price risk by the use of derivative instruments against fluctuations in fuel oil prices 
which 
affect the cost of fuel.
The Group has contracts for the sale of electricity to the Singapore electricity pool at prices that are fixed in advance 
every three months and to retail customers at prices that are either fixed in amount or in pricing formula for periods up 
to a number of years. The fixing of the prices under the contracts is based largely on the price of fuel oil required to 
generate the electricity. The Group enters into fuel oil swaps to hedge against adverse price movements of fuel oil prices. 
The Group typically enters into a swap to pay a fixed price and receive a variable price indexed to a benchmark fuel price 
index.
Exposure to price fluctuations arising from the purchase of fuel oil and natural gas are substantially managed via swaps 
where the price is indexed to a benchmark price index, for example 180 CST fuel oil and Dated Brent. The Group’s exposure 
to the fluctuation of forward price curve is immaterial.
(b)
 Credit risk
Credit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a counter party to settle their obligations to the Gr
oup 
and the Company.
The Group’s exposures to credit risk arise primarily from trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and other 
receivables. For other financial assets (including short-term investment securities, fixed deposits and derivative financial 
instruments), the Group minimises credit risk by dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Company’s exposures to credit risk arise primarily from other receivables and amounts owing by related companies. For 
other financial assets (including short-term investment securities and fixed deposits), the Company minimises credit risk by 
dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
Due to the nature of the Group’s business, customers are mainly segregated according to business segments. In the Group’s 
power generation business in Singapore, credit reviews are performed on all customers with established credit limits and 
supported by collateral in the form of guarantees for selected customers.
For the Group’s water and sewerage business, the credit risk of receivables is mitigated through strict collection procedures. 
In the Group’s telecommunications business, the credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through a credit policy. The 
Directors are of the view that credit risk arising from these businesses is limited due to the large customer base.

Trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies
The Group applies the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring ECL which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade 
receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts owing by related companies which is trade in nature. To measure 
the ECL, trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract assets have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics 
and the days past due.
The expected loss rates are determined based on between 1 to 19 (2022: 1 to 19) years of historical ageing profiles and the 
corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period as applicable. The historical loss rates are adjusted to 
reflect forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables. 
Some of the factors which the Group has identified include unemployment rates, economic trends, and annual Gross Domestic 
Product (“GDP”) growth. The Group has adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in such factors. The 
Group’s estimate of recoverability of the contract assets is based on forward-looking judgement on the future collection rate 
that are likely to be achieved.
On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets and amounts 
owing by related companies as follows:

Note:
(1) The expected loss rate comprises of customers with different risk profiles.
Cash and bank balances
The Group and the Company place its cash and bank balances with a number of creditworthy financial institutions. The Group’s 
and the Company’s policy limit the concentration of financial exposure to any single financial institution. While cash and bank 
balances are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
Derivative financial instruments
Transactions involving derivative financial instruments are allowed only with counterparties that are of high credit quality. As 
such, management does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. The Group considers the risk of material 
loss in the event of non-performance by a financial counter party to be unlikely.

Other receivables and amounts owing by related companies
The Group and the Company use the 3-stages approach for ECL on other receivables and amounts owing by related companies. 
The 3-stages approach reflects their receivables’ credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each of those 
categories.
A summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group’s and the Company’s ECL model is as follows:
Category Group’s and Company’s definition of category Basis for  
 recognising ECL
Performing Debtors 
have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet 
contractual cash flows
12 month ECL
Underperforming Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit risk or 
significant increase in credit risk is presumed if interest and/or principal 
repayments are 30 days past due
Lifetime ECL
Non-performing Debtors and repayments are more than 80 to 365 days past due Lifetime ECL
Write-off There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovery based on unavailability of debtor’s sources of income or assets 
to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount
Asset is written off
Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12 month ECL or lifetime ECL using a PD x LGD x EAD methodology 
where:
•
 PD (‘probability of 
default’) – the likelihood that the debtor would not be able to repay during the contractual period;
•
 LGD (‘loss 
given default’) – the percentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens; and
•
 EAD (‘exposure 
at default’) – the outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk.
In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group and the Company consider historical data by each debtor by category and adjusts for 
forward-looking macroeconomic data. The Group and the Company have identified the industry and geographical area which 
the debtor operates in to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected 
changes in these factors. Loss allowance is measured at a probability-weighted amount that reflects the possibility that a 
credit loss occurs and the possibility that no credit loss occurs. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions 
were made during the reporting period.

borrowings will be refinanced or repaid from existing undrawn facilities and the Group’s unencumbered cash.
(d)
 Capital risk
The objectives of the Group and the Company when managing capital are to safeguard the ability of the Group and the Company 
to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain 
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There are external debt covenants, such as gearing ratio applicable to the Group and the Company, which are not onerous 
and these obligations can be fulfilled. As part of its capital management, the Group rigorously monitors compliance with these 
covenants. In addition, consistent with others in the industry, the Group and the Company monitor capital on the basis of the 
gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including 
‘current and non-current borrowings’ as shown in the Statement of Financial Position) less cash and bank balances. Total capital 
is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the Statement of Financial Position plus net debt.
