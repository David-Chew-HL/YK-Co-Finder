W  WHY IT MATTERS
Implementing circular farming practices is crucial for
reducing the environmental impact of our operations, a 
concern magnified due to the proximity of many of our 
farms and land banks to protected natural environments 
andlocal communities. Through waste minimisation, 
resource recycling and by-product reuse, we lower our 
carbonfootprint, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissionsandconservewaterandlandresources.These
combined efforts deliver benefits across the value chain, 
improving livestock health, safeguarding the nutritional 
value of our products and preserving the fertility and 
integrity of our farmland.

O  OUR ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES
Embracing Regenerative Agriculture Practices
With the bulk of our operations undertaken in farms, the 
majority ofthe waste our business produces primarily
consists of organic waste generated by our herd, which 
can be further categorised as solid waste and farm dairy 
effluent(FDE).Todrivecircularity,oureffortshavethus
been focused on adopting regenerative agriculture 
practices to maximise the recycling of such waste and 
convert them into usable natural resources. 
Since2014,wehaveprogressivelyincreasedouruseof
regenerative agriculture techniques at all our farms.
Through the adoption of these circular practices, our
farms are able to reduce our reliance on external inputs, 
especially chemical fertilisers, and transform animal waste 
intoresourcesthatfulfilessentialfarmingfunctions.These
include turning solid waste into organic fertiliser and 
usablecomponentsforcowbedding,andliquidwasteinto
water used for pasture irrigation and cleaning barns.

Theseregenerativeagriculturalinitiatives,asfurtherdetailedbelow,enableustoredirectasignificantvolumeofanimal
wasteawayfromlandfillsandseweragesystemseachyear.Thishelpstomitigatemethaneemissionsresultingfrom
landfill decomposition and chemical treatments for sewerage systems, while reducing our reliance on external water 
sources and chemical fertilisers, the latter of which may have a negative impact on soil health.
Type of Waste 
Processing Outcomes and Processes Undertaken Benefits 
Solid Waste 
Processing
Organic Fertiliser
African Nightcrawler worms are used to break 
down the solid waste produced by our cows 
intovermicompost(wormcastings).
The vermicompost produced for compost
bedding is also used as an organic fertiliser for 
our pastures, enriching the grass that forms a 
significant part of the cows’ feed.
• Creates the perfect feed for vermiculture composting 
after five to six months
• Eliminates significant waste discharge into our
drainage system 
• Easesourrelianceonchemicalfertilisers
• Enrichesthephysicalcharacteristicsofoursoil,such
as water-holding capacity, aeration and porosity, 
thereby enhancing soil fertility
• Ensuresmorenutritiousfeedforourcows
FDE Processing After solid separation, the FDE undergoes 
three essential processes to ensure its safe 
and effective reuse in our farms:
Sedimentation
Theeffluentisallowedtosettleinsedimentation
ponds, where gravity helps remove any 
remainingsolidsfromtheliquidwaste.
Phytoremediation
Living plants are utilised to treat the effluent, 
effectively eliminating contaminants and excess 
nutrients.
Slow Sand Filtration
The effluent is then passed through aslow
sand filtration system, which removes turbidity 
and pathogenic organisms.
• Decreasesourdependenceonexternalwatersupplies
• Eliminates significant waste discharge into our
drainage system
• Lowers groundwater and surface water contamination 
by limiting the release of toxic waste into the 
environment
Barn Washing and Flushing
The treated water, along with recycled 
rainwater,issubsequently used for washing
and flushing our barns.
FDE Processing Microbial Vermifiltration
After undergoing solid separation and 
sedimentation processes, the treated FDE
undergoes microbial vermifiltration, a biological 
wastewater treatment method using 
composting worms.
Pasture Irrigation
After this, water suitable for irrigating our 
pastures is developed and subsequently 
utilised. 
• Releases  valuable  nutrients  for plant  growth, 
contributingtoenhancedfeedqualityforourcows
and produce for our customers 
• Ensuresyear-roundproductionofnutritiousgrassby
providing sufficient water to pastures, even during the 
dry season

Transforming Waste into Fuel
Ourapproachtocircularfarmingalsoextendstotheadoptionofwaste-to-fuelpractices.Asanagriculturalentity,biogas
plants provide us with a viable opportunity to turn animal and agricultural waste into clean and renewable energy.
Tothisend,wehavepartneredwithGreenLagoonTechnologySdnBhdtodevelopanewbiogasfacilityinourMuadzam

W  WHY IT MATTERS
Responsiblewatermanagementbenefitsbothourbusiness
andlocalcommunities.Extractinganddischarging water
responsibly protects the health of our soil and maintains 
theoverallqualityofourproducts,resultinginmorerobust
crop yields, improved product reliability and enhanced 
marketcompetitiveness.Simultaneously,thesepractices
safeguard local water resources from depletion and 
contamination, protecting local livelihoods, fostering 
stronger community relations and safeguarding our 
reputation.
RESPONSIBLE WATER STEWARDSHIP
O  OUR ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES
Advancing Water Sustainability
As an agrifood business, our farm operations heavily rely 
on water to manage the health of our herds and grassland, 
as well as for production, cleaning and other general 
purposes. While we do not currently possess operations 
location in water-stressed or water-scarce regions, we 
remain deeply committed to sustainable water management, 
encompassing efforts to recycle rainwater, mitigate water 
contamination and reduce our reliance on surface and 
municipal water sources. 
Toimplementourholisticandproactiveapproach,wehave
made strategic investments into new technologies for 
collecting and utilising rainwater and groundwater, while 
also growing our circular agricultural practices that minimise 
impactsrelated toour water discharge.Throughthese
collective practices, we successfully reduced our utilisation 
ofmunicipalwaterby618.51millionℓinFY2024inour
Malaysia farms. 
Harnessing Groundwater and Rainwater
Groundwater, available year-round and less susceptible to 
droughts, serves as a reliable water source and reduces 
our dependence on municipal water during periods of 
scarcity.Tominimisetheimpactofourwithdrawalneeds
from surface water, we have implemented tube well 
pumping systems that extract groundwater from the lower 
levels of the water table, which is vital for preserving soil 
health and protecting natural resources for neighbouring 
farms and communities.
Concurrently, our rainwater harvesting systems also play a 
significant role in our water conservation efforts, enabling 
the capture and storage of rainwater for various farm-
basedtasks. From barn washing and irrigation toherd
cleaning and machinery maintenance, rainwater provides a 
sustainable alternative to municipal sources and reduces 
our extraction from the natural water table.
Mitigating Water Contamination
Untreated animal waste poses substantial threats to both 
waterqualityandecosystemintegrity,whilealsobearing
the potential of contaminating our dairy production 
processes.Toaddressthischallenge,weadoptregenerative
agriculture practices to treat and repurpose solid and 
liquidanimal waste into valuable resources for reuse,
effectively distancing animal waste from water sources and 
significantly diminishing the risk of cross-contamination. 
Our responsible practices during FY2024 prevented 
146,730tonnesofsolidwasteand418millionℓofliquid
waste from potentially entering the water table and local 
waterways. For more information, refer tothe “Circular
Practices”sectionofthisstatement.

W  WHY IT MATTERS
With agrifood systems contributing significantly to GHG 
emissions, it is crucial for us to minimise our carbon 
footprint and effectively manage all emissions from our 
operations. By implementing robust energy and emission 
management strategies, we help mitigate the impacts of 
climate change, enhance the resilience of our supply chain 
and set an exemplary standard for environmental 
stewardship in the Malaysian and regional dairy farming 
communities.Oureffortsinthisareawillsimultaneously
strengthen our reputation for sustainability among 
consumers and other key stakeholders, bolstering our 
prospects for long-term growth.
ENERGY & EMISSIONS
O  OUR ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES
Harnessing Solar Power and Biogas
Ourcorporatestrategyforincorporatingrenewableenergy
into our operations focuses on the two approaches 
considered most viable at present: solar power and biogas 
production.Throughaphasedintegration,weareactively
reducing our dependence on the Malaysian national power 
grid while concurrently expanding our contribution to the 
broader renewable energy ecosystem. 
Todate,wehavesuccessfullyintroducedphotovoltaic(PV)
technologyatthreelocations–MuadzamShah,Larkinand
Taiping–harnessingthesubstantial potentialofsolar
power in tropical climates. 
InFY2024,ourtubewellpumpingandrainwaterharvestingeffortscollectivelysaved618.51millionℓofmunicipal
water,resultingina4%reductioninmunicipalwaterusage.
LOOKING AHEAD
After evaluating our current performance and progress, and considering the potential impacts of our ongoing 
water conservation initiatives, we have revised our water performance targets as follows:
• We aim to broaden our utilisation of rainwater harvesting and tube well pumping systems, striving to increase 
ourutilisationofgroundwaterandsurfacewaterby20%perannum
• Throughtheseefforts,weaimtoincreasemunicipalwatersavingsby10%perannum.

---- Page 7 ----
Meanwhile, we have further added to the regenerative 
agriculturalpracticesatMuadzamShahbyestablishinga
new on-site biogas plant that will enable us to utilise our 
herd’smanuretogeneraterenewableenergy.Followingthe
completion of construction and testing activities during 
FY2024,theplantcommencedoperationsinApril2024and
is expected to contribute towards reducing our emissions 
by9,800tonnesofcarbondioxideequivalent(tCO2eq)per
annumandreducingourdieselusageby670,000ℓper
annum. Looking ahead, we will explore the feasibility of 
implementingsimilarbiogasprojectsatourotherfarmsif
theanticipatedresultsareachievedatMuadzamShah.
Mitigating Nitrous Oxide Emissions
Ourprimaryfocusinreducingnitrousoxideemissionsisto
minimise our reliance on traditional chemical fertilisers that 
release this potent GHG into the atmosphere. By using 
treated animal waste for pasture fertilisation, a key aspect 
of our regenerative agriculture practices, we significantly 
reduce chemical fertiliser usage while being able to adopt 
vermicompostingtechniquestoprovidesuperiorfeedfor
our cows.
Besides that, our efforts to treat and repurpose animal 
waste also contribute to a decrease in the potential release 
of nitrous oxide from untreated waste, thereby further 
mitigating noxious emissions from our farms.
Assessing and Monitoring our GHG Emissions
To accurately assess and monitor our emissions 
performance, we engage an independent third party to 
conduct a Group-wide carbon footprint inventory. Unlike 
previous assessments done for each calendar year, our 
latestevaluationwasperformed byEco-Ideal Consulting
SdnBhdforthefinancialyearfromApril2023toMarch
2024(FY2024).Thisapproachwillallowforbetteralignment
of our emissions performance with each financial period of 
the Group moving forward.
ConductedinJune 2024, Eco-Ideal Consulting used the
GHGProtocolCorporateAccountingandReportingStandard
to assess emissions across our farms and processing 
facilities in Malaysia and Australia, including the corporate 
storesand manufacturing plants ofour newly acquired
companies,InsideScoopandSinWah.Theexercisecovered
all three of the following emission scopes:
• Scope 1 GHG emissions: Direct emissions from
machinery,equipmentandmotorvehiclesatourfarms
and processing facilities, as well as emissions from 
enteric fermentation, manure management and soil 
management at our farms.
• Scope 2 GHG emissions:Emissionsfromtheelectricity
usedtopowermachineryandequipmentatourfarms
and processing facilities.
• Scope 3 GHG emissions: Indirect emissions  not
coveredinScope2,suchasthosefrombusinesstravel
by car, train, flight as well as emissions from employee 
commuting.
The FY2024 emissions assessment indicated that the
emissions intensity of our farms in Malaysia and Australia 
remain well below the average emissions levels for dairy 
farmsinAsiaandOceania,demonstratingtheeffectiveness
of our responsible farming and energy conservation 
practices.
We will continue to utilise the carbon emissions data 
gathered from these GHG inventory exercises to closely 
analyse our performance and develop emissions reduction 
strategies in line with our commitment to reducing our 
Group-wide carbon footprint.
OUR PERFORMANCE
ThescopeofourcarbonemissionsmonitoringencompassesourdairyfarmsandmanufacturingplantsinMalaysia
andAustraliaaswellastheoperationsofournewlyacquiredcompanies,InsideScoopandSinWah.Ourcomprehensive
approach covers all three scopes of GHG monitoring, including indirect emissions from employee commuting and 
business travel. 
Sinceourlastassessment,ourGroup-widetotalemissionshaverisenby30%,from68,892tCO2eqinCY2022to
89,856tCO2eqinFY2024.Thisincreaseislargelyduetotheinclusionofoperationalassetsfromournewacquisitions,
specificallythecorporatestoresofInsideScoopandSinWah’sfactory.Theuptickinemissionsalsoreflectshigher
production activities, which led to increased fertiliser use at our farms and higher electricity and fuel consumption at 
ourMuadzamShahmanufacturingplant.Tooffsettheseemissions,weareimplementingcarbonreductioninitiatives
such as increasing solar power usage and operationalising our biogas plant. 
Meanwhile,ourGroupwideemissionsintensityhasincreasedfrom0.44tCO2eq/tonneofmilkinFY2023to0.48
tCO2eq/tonneofmilkinFY2024.Excluding newbusinessess(InsideScoop,SinWahandJomCha),theemission
intensityremainsat0.44tCO2eq/tonneofmilk.

LOOKING AHEAD
We have developed the following strategies for enhancing 
our future performance based on the insights gained 
from our carbon footprint inventory exercise:
• Implementing anaerobic digestion tanks toreplace
existinganaerobic lagoonsatour MuadzamShah
farm, allowing us to convert farm-sourced manure 
into biofuel.
• Installing solar thermal systemstodecreasediesel

ourfarms.InFY2024,68%ofourtotalprocurementoutlay
byFarmFreshMalaysiawasspentonlocalsuppliers.
Fostering Sustainable, Win-Win Farmer Partnerships
Thenetworkofruralpartner farmersweestablished in
2011 has been crucial in allowing us to cost-effectively fulfil 
ourexternal dairysourcing requirements andpriceour
products competitively. Equally importantly, our direct
dealings with these farmers ensure that they, too, receive 
fair market prices for raw milk, which contributes to 
uplifting their livelihoods and bolstering local agriculture, 
key factors that support the Malaysian government’s 
objectiveofachievingself-sufficiencyindomesticfreshmilk
production by 2025.
Beyond milk procurement, we have strengthened our 
partnership with these partner farmers by offering 
mentorship programmes and technical support to facilitate 
knowledge transfer throughout the production process. 
Thisdisseminatessustainablefarmingpracticesacrossour
value chain, promoting environmental stewardship and 
safeguarding the long-term viability of our business.
Empowering Rural Distribution and Entrepreneurship  
Introducedin2016,ourinnovativehomedealerprogramme
revolutionises our distribution networks in rural Malaysia, 
providingaccesstoFarmFreshandYarraFarmproductsin
areaswithoutmajorgrocerystoresorsupermarkets.With
58 stockists, 762 home dealers and 971 agents nationwide, 
this initiative extends our product reach while creating 
sustainable income opportunities for micro-entrepreneurs.

Throughthisfirst-of-its-kindprogramme,weempowerindependententrepreneurstoearncommissionsbydistributing
our products within their communities, while simultaneously advocating the nutritional benefits of dairy products to their 
network.Tosupportthemintheirendeavours,weconsistentlyinvestintheprofessionaldevelopmentofourhome
dealers, offering regular seminars and courses on products, prices, and sales and distribution strategies.

network, we have adopted the use of e-commerce platforms that facilitate online purchases and conveniently connect 
customers with our home dealers and agents.
Thesuccessofourhomedealerprogrammeisevidencedbyitsinfluenceonourfinancialperformance,withdirectsales
tostockistsanddistributionsupportfromournetworkpartnerscontributing17%ofourtotalrevenueinFY2024.The
socialbenefitsofthisprogrammehasalsobeenrecognisedattheregionallevel,asitclaimedtheASEANInclusive
Business Award in 2020.
OUR PERFORMANCE
• 67%ofourworkforceacrossfarmsandprocessingfacilitiesoriginatesfromruralandunderservedcommunities.
• 68%ofourtotalprocurementduringFY2024wasspentonlocalsuppliers.

efforts contribute towards a healthier and more empowered 
future generation, while growing our appeal to socially 
conscious consumers and investors. 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
O  OUR ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES
Providing Comprehensive Support for Underprivileged 
Students
As part of our efforts to uplift hardcore poor students with 
education, nutrition and living standards, we have launched 
theMultidimensional Human Capital Development 
Programme(ProgramPembangunanInsanMultidimensi)in
June2023,committingnearlyRM2milliontosetupand
run special community centres in areas with high numbers 
of hardcore poor students. 
IncollaborationwiththeMalaysianMinistriesofEducation
and Health,and YayasanDidikNegara,wehavenow

Malaysia, providing more than 500 students with extra 
classes, tuition, religious classes, motivational sessions and 
nutritiousmeals,includingFarmFreshmilk.
By pioneering this effort, we aim to pave the way for other 
large corporations, multinationals and government-linked 
companiestojointhisnoblecauseandmakeameaningful
impact in underprivileged communities nationwide.
Internships and Scholarship Programme
Concurrently, we nurture local talent through development 
programmes, such as internships in collaboration with 
esteemeduniversitiesandcollegesinMalaysia.Thisyear
we have provided internship placements to 192 high-
achieving students, facilitating the opportunity for many of 
these participants to transition into full-time positions 
within our company.
We also aim to remove barriers to higher education for 
Orang Asli students, empowering them topursue their
academic dreams through the Farm Fresh Scholarship
Programme.Launchedin2021inpartnershipwiththeEast
Coast Economic RegionDevelopment Council (ECERDC),
this programme provides life-changing opportunities for 
disenfranchised students through the provision of financial 
support for their primary, secondary and tertiary education.

Promoting Healthy Development with the 
School Milk Programme
Recognisingthecrucialrolethatnutritionplaysin
a child’s developmental years, we are committed 
to nurturing healthier milk consumption habits 
amongst the younger generation, whom we refer 
toas‘GenerasiFarmFresh’.Tothisend,wehave
collaborated with the Malaysian Ministry of 
EducationtocommenceaSchoolMilkProgramme
(ProgramSusuSekolah)thatfacilitatesthedelivery
of nutritious milk to school canteens across the 
Northern,Eastern and Southern regions of

Throughourparticipationinthisprogramme,we
have successfully distributed over 65 million packs 
of school milk to more than 3,400 schools from 
April2023 toMarch 2024.The success ofour
efforts underscores the positive impact of our

W  WHY IT MATTERS
Ensuringstrongemployeehealthandsafetymeasuresis
crucial as it provides a secure work environment where 
our staff can perform their duties without risking their 
healthorsafety.Thisisparticularlyimportantgiventhat
many of our employees work on farms and in processing 
facilities, where they face occupational hazards such as 
heavy machinery, livestock handling in high heat and 
humidity,andconstructionorrepairtasks.Ourdedicated
efforts in this area help reduce workplace accidents and 
injuries,lowerabsenteeismandminimisepotentialmedical
costs, while also fostering a work environment that 
promotesjobsatisfaction,productivityandloyalty.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY & WELL-BEING
O  OUR ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES
Robust Policy Commitments
At the heart of our employee health, safety and welfare 
strategy lies the implementation of robust occupational 
health and safety systems across our farms and processing 
facilities.Inourefforts tocomprehensively address the
uniquechallengesfacedbyouremployeesintheirfarm-
basedworkingenvironments,wehavedevelopedaSafety
–BestManagementPracticesandaSafety&HealthPolicy
and Environmental Policy that strictly adhere to the
following Malaysian regulations and laws:
• OccupationalSafetyandHealthAct1994
• OccupationalSafetyandHealth(UseandStandardof
ExposureChemical HazardoustoHealth)Regulation
2000
• OccupationalSafetyandHealth(NotificationofAccident,
DangerousOccurrence,Occupational Poisoningand
OccupationalDisease)Regulation2004
• EnvironmentalQualityAct1974
• Environmental Quality (Scheduled waste) regulation
2005
• FireServicesAct1988
A Dedicated Committee and Leadership Oversight
As part of our proactive strategy to identify and respond to 
emergingrisks,wehaveestablishedaSafety,Healthand
EnvironmentCommitteetoheightenengagementwithour
people and foster inclusive dialogue on health and safety 
matters.
Consisting of an ideal mix of employer and employee 
representation, the committee’s primary responsibilities 
encompass, but are not confined to:
• Conducting regular workplace inspections, including 
specific assessments of machinery, equipment, 
substances, appliances and work processes.
• Investigating workplace accidents, near misses, 
dangerous occurrences, occupational poisoning and 
occupationaldiseases, and subsequently reporting.
significant findings and recommending corrective 
actions to the management
• Supporting the development of internal safety and
health rules, and safe work systems.
• Assessing the effectiveness of existing safety and health 
policies, and proposing revisions as necessary.
ThroughourSafety,HealthandEnvironmentCommittee,
we facilitate open and direct communication with 
employees, enabling concerns to be promptly addressed 
so that a conducive and secure working environment is 
maintained at all times.
All healthand safety issuesaremonitored by our HR
department and Safety team, which benchmarks our
performance against industry peers to strive for the 
highest health and safety standards. Meanwhile, leadership 
oversightisprovidedbytheAuditandRiskManagement
Committee of our Board, which thoroughly reviews internal 
audit reports and management recommendations to 
enhance the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. 
Thisstructureensuresthatallmaterialhealthandsafety
matters are brought to the attention of relevant leaders, 
and that continuous improvement in our practices is driven 
from the highest levels.

Upholding HIRARC and Training Protocols
OurHazardIdentification,RiskAssessmentandRiskControl
(HIRARC) procedures are fundamental for managing 
potentially hazardous activities within our operations. 
Dedicated safety staff oversee their implementation to
ensure personnel safety alongside regular factory safety 
audits, maintaining consistently safe working environments.
Theseproceduresincludestringentprotocolsformachinery
operation and maintenance which are uniformly enforced 
across all our farms and production facilities. Additionally, 
we implement proactive measures to identify and address 
emerging hazards, such as:
• Conducting regular safety audits of processing facilities.
• Monitoring, measuring and controlling our exposure to 
hazardous chemicals.
• Administering annual audiometric tests to employees in 
our processing facilities to evaluate noise exposure and 
its impact on their hearing.
• EstablishingInternalEmergencyResponseTeams(ERT)
responsible for evacuating employees and handling 
fires during emergencies.
Besides that, employee training is prioritised across all 
levelsandjobfunctions,withtailoredprogrammescovering
occupational first aid, confined space training, forklift and 
reachtruckhandling.Personalprotectiveequipment(PPE)
is also provided as needed to enhance safety.
Toensurenewemployeesarewell-informedaboutsafety
measures and protocols, a comprehensive safety awareness 
component has been integrated into our orientation 
programme.
Uplifting Rural Communities through Sustainable 
and Healthy Living
Another key practice to safeguard employee well-being is 
our provision of housing and resources for farm-based 
staff.Currently, 80% ofour farmemployees receive
subsidised meals, while 50% enjoy complimentary 
accommodation. Additionally, these employees are provided 
with fresh vegetables and fish sourced directly from our 
farms, ensuring nutritious and sustainable dietary options 
for their daily meals.
Theseinitiativesnotonlysupportouremployeesfinancially
andenhancetheirjobsatisfaction,butalsoalignwithour
commitment to fostering economic progress in rural 
communities. For more information, refer tothe “Local
EconomyContribution”sectionofthisstatement.
OUR PERFORMANCE
• Zero work-related fatalities were recorded in the last 
three years.
• ZeroLostTimeInjuries(LTIs)wererecordedinthe
last three years.
• 121 employees received health and safety training in 
FY2024,withanaverageof112hoursoftraining
provided to each employee.
• 100%ofouremployeesarecoveredbyoursafety
best management practices and Safety &Health
Policy and Environmental Policy implemented 
throughout the organisation.
• 80%ofourfarmemployeesenjoysubsidisedmeals,
while50%benefitfromfreeaccommodation.

W  WHY IT MATTERS
Fair and ethical  employment  is fundamental  to our
commitment as a sustainable and honest dairy company, 
enshrinedasoneofourfivecorevalues.Ourconscientious
approach to training and nurturing our workforce, while 
providing them with an impartial and respectful work 
environment, ensures we retain a high-performing, 
committed and diverse team. By maintaining this standard, 
weupholdthequalityandreliabilityofourproductsand
services, enhancing our competitiveness in the markets we 
operateinandsupportingourgrowthobjectives.
FAIR & ETHICAL EMPLOYMENT
O  OUR APPROACH
Guided by Internal Policies and Jurisdictional Laws
To ensure responsible business  conduct across our
operations, we have developed a Code of Conduct &
BusinessEthics(CCBE)thatalignswiththelaws,regulations
andbestpracticesofMalaysia’sdairyindustry.Thiscode
upholds the principles of discipline, good faith, 
professionalism and integrity essential to our company’s 
success and well-being.
Infullysupportingtheprinciplesandinternationalguidelines
for human rights, we are dedicated to maintaining a safe 
work environment enriched by diversity and characterised 
by open communication, trust, shared accountability, fair 
treatment and respect. We treat each and every of our 
staff, suppliers, stakeholders and the community with the 
utmost respect in alignment with our core values.
Our commitmenttofair recruitmentand procurement
practices firmly opposes discrimination of potential hiring 
candidates or suppliers based on their race or gender, 
emphasisingamerit-basedprocessthatprioritisesequal
opportunities.
Alongside our internal policies and guidelines, we adhere 
tothe Malaysian Employment Act 1955, ensuring 
compliance with workers’ rights, fair working hours and 
adequatelivingwages.Weconsistentlybenchmarkourpay
structure against industry standards and consult with 
external professionals to ensure we maintain remuneration 
practices that uphold compliance with labour laws and 
enableustoattracttherequisitetalents.
Additionally,ourWhistleBlowingPolicy(readmoreinthe
‘Anti-Corruption’sectionofthisreport)enablesemployees
and the public to confidentially report any incidents of 
misconduct through internal channels.
Although we have recorded no significant non-compliance 
incidents related to labour standards, we have established 
processes to manage such situations should they occur. 
Theseprocesses include  counselling and consulting 
external experts to mediate and resolve incidents in 
accordance with the relevant labour standards.
Fostering a Diverse and Respectful Workplace
We recognise the importance of workplace diversity, which 
brings a wealth of experiences, expertise and perspectives 
toour organisation. This diversity enables informed 
decision-making and fosters a culture of unity and 
appreciation for different backgrounds.
Topromote diversity, weaimforabalanced workforce,
with a healthy mix of genders, particularly in management 
andexecutiveroles.OurworkforcealsoreflectsMalaysia’s
culturaldiversity,comprisingvariousraces.Employeesare
free to practice their cultural and religious beliefs, and we 
celebrate our diversity during festive seasons.
Our employees deserve arespectful work environment
free from harassment or discrimination. Any form of 
abusive conduct, whether verbal, physical or virtual, is 
unacceptable. We strictly prohibit actions or unwanted 
comments related to gender, race, national or ethnic 
origin, disability, religion, age, family status or other legally 
protectedstatuses.Employeesareencouragedtoreport
any abusive, harassing or offensive behaviour they observe 
or experience to a supervisor or member of management.

TheBoardofDirectorsholdsultimateresponsibilityforoverseeingallethicalconductandanti-corruptionmatters.The
Group Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer leads monitoring efforts and issupported bythe Group Human
Resourcesdepartment,whichmanagestheseaffairsonadailybasis.
FarmFreshBerhadhasnotmadeanydonationstoanyassociationswithpoliticalpartiesororganisationsduringthe
financial year.
An overview of each of our policies related to ethical business conduct and anti-corruption is detailed below.
Code of Conduct & Business Ethics (CCBE)
TheBoard,asoutlinedintheBoardcharter,hasthecriticalresponsibilityofestablishingandupholdingtheethical
standardsexpectedofeveryonewithintheGroup.Thisincludesdirectors,management,employeesand,where
applicable, counterparts and business partners.
Toachievethis,theBoard,incollaborationwithmanagement,hasimplementedandenforcedacomprehensive
CCBEthatdetailsourprinciples,valuesanddutiesexpectedfromouremployees,alongsiderulesandguidelines
forworkplacebehaviour.Thepolicyalsoputsforthourguidelinesforfairmarketpractices,includingrulestoensure
our employees uphold competition and antitrust laws designed to ensure fair competition for products and services 
in the marketplace. 
Aligned with Malaysian laws, regulations and best practices of the local dairy industry, this comprehensive document 
servesasaroadmapfornavigatingethicalconductintheGroup.TheCCBEisfurthersupplementedbydistinct,
detailed policies that manage conflicts of interest, prevent abuse of power, corruption and insider trading, and 
combat money laundering.
Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) Policy
OurABAC Policy outlines ourzero-tolerance stance onbribery, corruption andgratification encountered by
directors,employeesandthirdpartiesassociatedwiththeGroupinbusinessdealings.Thepolicyprovidesstrict
guidelines on accepting gifts and hospitality while prohibiting employees and third parties from offering or accepting 
facilitation payments at any time.
EmployeesatalllevelsmustdeclarethattheyhavereadandunderstoodtheABACPolicy.Theymustalsosigna
ConflictofInterestDeclarationtoavoidpotentialconflictsbetweencompanyandprivateinterests.
We have implemented an appropriate internal control system to address any corruption risks stemming from 
weaknesses inourgovernance framework, processes andprocedures. Tothis end, weconduct regular risk
assessment reviews to evaluate the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of these internal controls and 
enforcementmeasures.Thesereviewsarecarriedouteitherbyaninternalfunctionoranexternalpartyevery
three years, with additional reviews conducted as needed.
Employees foundviolating theABACpolicywillbesubjecttodisciplinary action,aswellaspotential criminal
investigation andprosecution. TheGroup remains committed toensuring full cooperation with therelevant
enforcement agencies in the event of any suspicions, allegations, or investigations related to bribery or corruption.

Whistle Blowing Policy
OurWhistle Blowing Policy providesachannel forallemployees andmembersofthepublic toreport any
improper conduct related to our business, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability. Allegations of 
suspected fraud, bribery, abuse of power, conflict of interest, theft or embezzlement can be reported through the 
SpeakUpportalat:https://farmfresh.speakup.report/farmfreshspeakup.
Allreportsaretreatedconfidentially,andwillbediscussedanddeliberateduponbytheARMC.Whistle-blowers
will be informed of the outcome upon the completion of the process and related procedures.
AsperourTermsofReferenceofARMC,theARMCoverseesthewhistle-blowingfunction,ensuringallreported
violations are properly investigated and reviewing the effectiveness of the actions taken in response to all concerns 
raised.
Whistle-blowers will be granted protection for the confidentiality of their identity, as far as reasonably practicable, 
and safeguarded from any form of retaliation for raising genuine concerns or reporting violations or suspected 
violations in good faith.
Ethical Trading Policy
OurEthical TradingPolicysetsoutthestandardsweexpectthroughoutoursupplychain,aligningwithour
commitment to ensure our products are manufactured in conditions that are neither detrimental to the goods nor 
harmfultotheworkers.AllsuppliersmustcomplywiththeEthicalTradingpolicy,whichwillbeautomatically
accepted unless advised otherwise.
Thepolicyupholdsseveralkeyprinciples,includingfreedomofemployment,therighttocollectivebargaining,
freedom of association, safe and hygienic working conditions, the right to a living wage, and regular employment. 
Additionally, it prohibits child labour, excessive working hours, discrimination and harsh or inhumane treatment.
Training and Awareness
Toensurecontinuouscompliancewithethicalpractices,we
are committed to making sure our employees understand 
our expectations in performing their duties and 
responsibilities.Employees are briefed onour Code of
Conduct &Business Ethics (CCBE) andAnti-Bribery and
Anti-Corruption (ABAC) Policyduringtheir orientation 
program. We also regularly conduct awareness programs 
for employees on anti-bribery and anti-corruption.
While we aim for comprehensive training for all employees, 
we prioritise training based on the level of bribery and 
corruption risk associated with each employee’s position or 
department. 
OUR PERFORMANCE
• InFY2024,89.26%ofallemployeesreceivedanti-
corruption training. As of May 2024, our completion 
ratesroseto94.38%
• 100%ofouroperations havebeenassessed for
corruption-related risks.
• Zero staff disciplined or dismissed due to ethical 
non-compliance 
• Zero fines, penalties or settlements received in 
relation to corruption

W  WHY IT MATTERS
Intoday’sdigitalera,theimportanceofcybersecurityand
dataprivacycontinuestogrow.Safeguardingoursystems
and databases from potential cyber threats and breaches 
ofprivacy isvital tomaintaining business stability. Our
ongoing efforts in this area also ensures compliance with 
evolving data protection laws, reduces legal and reputational 
risks, and builds trust among our stakeholders.
CYBER SECURITY & DATA PRIVACY
O  OUR APPROACH
Ensuring a Holistic Approach to IT Governance
OurInformationTechnology(IT)PolicyensurestheGroup’s
IT resources efficiently support our primary business
functions, safeguard our and members’ electronic data, 
and comply with relevant regulations in our areas of 
operation.TheITDepartmentenforcesandupdatesthis
policy, covering best practices in firewall protection, security 
incident management, cloud computing adoption, 
vulnerability assessment and disaster recovery.
Crucially, the policy mandates the creation of prudent and 
acceptable practices for anti-virus management to prevent 
infection of our computers, networks and technology 
systemsfrommalwareandothermaliciouscode.Italso
aims to prevent damage to user applications, data, files 
and hardware by educating individuals who use our system 
resources on their responsibilities regarding anti-virus 
protection.
Toensurethat our employees, Board membersand
related constituents use mobile devices safely and securely 
toaccessourresources,theymustaccepttheITPolicyby
signingtheGroupDeclarationforSecurityPolicyonUsage
ofCompanyMobileDevicesbeforereceivingadeviceand
access to our resources. 
All our network firewalls provide packet filtering, application 
proxyandstatefulinspectiontosafeguardagainstInternet
Protocol(IP)spoofingandDenial-of-Service(DoS)attacks,
ensuring a secure operating environment for our computer 
and network resources. To sustain this protection and
mitigate risks to our network and information systems, our 
firewalls undergo regular reviews. Additionally, firewall 
rulesetsandconfigurations arefrequentlybackedupto
alternate storage. 
Vulnerability Assessments and Incident Management
Tokeepoursecuritysystemscurrent,alloperatingsystems
and information resources must undergo regular 
vulnerabilityassessments.OurITdepartmentistaskedwith
conducting periodic security risk evaluations to identify 
vulnerabilities and implement appropriate corrective 
measures, with employees expected to fully cooperate with 
these assessments.
Effectivesecurityincidentmanagementisalsocrucialfor
detecting threats, evaluating their severity, responding 
properly and informing stakeholders of any breaches when 
necessary.Ourframeworkincludescomputeremergency
response plans, incident response testing, response and 
recovery protocols, and data breach management.
TheITDepartmentconductssimulatedincidentsatleast
once a year to assess the effectiveness of our response. 
Theoutcomesofthesesimulationsareusedtoreviewand
update our response plans as necessary.
Safeguarding our Digital Assets
TheGroupemploysDattoSaaSasabackupandrecovery
solution, aiding in the restoration of data such as Microsoft 
Exchangeemails,filesandOneDrivedata.Thisiscrucialin
the event of any incidents affecting our servers. 
For ransomware protection, we rely on Bitdefender 
Gravityzone Business Premium, a globally recognised 
cybersecurity solution. Gravityzone offers advanced layered 
machine-learning algorithms for ransomware detection and 
sandboxing, ensuring ransomware protection at both the 
personalcomputer(PC)andserverlevels.
All data transfers undergo scanning by Bitdefender for 
addedsecurity.Moreover,weutiliseMicrosoftDefenderfor
Office365todetectmalwareandphishingattemptsearly,
primarily scanning emails as the primary attack medium, 
withextendedcoveragetoOneDrive,TeamsandMicrosoft
Officeapplications.

SIRIM QAS INTERNATIONAL SDN BHD 
INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
 
 
To Board of Directors, Stakeholders, and Interested Parties, 
 
 
SIRIM QAS International Sdn. Bhd. was engaged by Farm Fresh Berhad (hereafter referred to as Farm Fresh) to perform an 
independent verification and provide assurance of Farm Fresh Sustainability Report 2024. The main objective of the 
verification process is to provide assurance to Farm Fresh and its stakeholders on the accuracy and reliability of the 
information as presented in this statement. The verification by SIRIM QAS International applied to sustainable performance 
information (subject matter) within the assurance scope which is included in Farm Fresh Sustainability Report 2024. 
 
The management of Farm Fresh was responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.  The objective and 
impartiality of this statement is assured as no member of the verification team and no other employee of SIRIM QAS 
International was involved in the preparation of any part of the Farm Fresh’s Sustainability Report, and the Annual Report 
2024. 
 
The assurance engagement was designed to provide limited assurance in accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information, and BURSA Sustainability Reporting Guide, irrespective of the organization’s ability to achieve its objectives, 
targets or expectations on their subject matter and sustainability -related issues. The assurance process involves verification 
of 12 material matters as presented in the Sustainability Report within topics as follows i.e., Better Dairy, Healthier Plane t, 
Stronger Communities, and Responsible Governance. Details are provided in Appendix 1. 
 
The verification was carried out by SIRIM QAS International between June and July 2024, with the following methodologies: 
• Reviewing and verifying the traceability, consistency and accuracy of information collected from various sources; 
internal and external documentation which are made available during the conduct of assessment. 
• Verification of data presented in the Sustainability Report includes a detailed check of the sampled data. 
• Interviewing key personnel responsible for collating information and writing various parts of the report to 
substantiate the veracity of the claims. 
 
The verification process was subjected to the following limitations:

Conclusion 
SIRIM QAS International, a Conformity Assessment Body in Malaysia, is accredited to both ISO/IEC 17021 -1:2015 and 
ISO/IEC 17065:2012 covering all our operational activit ies. The appointed assessors performing the assurance engagement 
were selected appropriately based on our internal qualifications, training and experience. The verification process is  
reviewed by management to ensure that the approach and assurance are strictly followed and operated transparently.  
During the verification process, issues were raised, and clarifications were sought from the management of Farm Fresh 
relating to the accuracy of some of the information contained in the report. In response to the raised findings, the 
Sustainability Report was subsequently reviewed and revised by Farm Fresh.  It is confirmed that changes that have been 
incorporated into the final version of the report have satisfactorily addressed all issues. Based on the scope of the 
assessment process and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Farm Fresh 
has not complied, in all material respects, with the referred assurance standard and guide. The following represents SIRIM 
QAS International’s opinion: 
• The level of data accuracy included in Farm Fresh Sustainability Report 2024 is fairly stated; 
• The level of disclosure of the specific sustainability performance information presented in the report was found to be 
properly prepared; 
• The personnel responsible were able to demonstrate the origin(s) and interpretation of data contained in the report; 
• The Sustainability Report offers a reasonable and balanced presentation of Farm Fresh’s sustainability 
performance.

inaccordancewithMFRSAccountingStandardsasissuedbytheMalaysianAccountingStandardsBoard(“MFRSAccounting
Standards”),IFRSAccountingStandardsasissuedbytheInternationalAccountingStandardsBoard(“IFRSAccounting

Auditing.OurresponsibilitiesunderthosestandardsarefurtherdescribedintheAuditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Financial Statements section of our auditors’ report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

and Practice) oftheMalaysianInstituteofAccountants(“By-Laws”)andtheInternational EthicsStandardsBoardfor
Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA
Code”),andwehavefulfilledourotherethicalresponsibilitiesinaccordancewiththeBy-LawsandtheIESBACode.
Key Audit Matters
Keyauditmattersarethosemattersthat,inourprofessionaljudgement,wereofmostsignificanceinourauditofthe
financialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompanyforthecurrentyear.Thesematterswereaddressedinthecontext
of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
a. Acquisition of subsidiaries – Group and Company

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Key Audit Matters (continued)
a. Acquisition of subsidiaries – Group and Company (continued)
The key audit matter (continued)
Wehaveidentifiedtheacquisitionofsubsidiariesasakeyauditmatterbecausethetransactionsarecomplexand
thedeterminationoffairvaluesintheidentifiableassetsacquired,andliabilitiesassumed,includingtheidentification
ofintangibleassetsrequiressignificantjudgement.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We performed the following audit procedures, amongst others:
• WehavereadtheSHAtoidentifythecompletiondateoftransaction,theamountofconsiderationpayableand
tounderstandsignificanttermsoftheagreementincludingtheputoptionarrangement;
• Wehaveassessedthefairvaluesoftheacquiredassetsandliabilitiesrecognisedbyagreeingthebookvalueto
supportingdocumentation;
• WehaveassessedtheCompany’svaluationmodelusedforrecognisingtheintangibleassetsacquired,witha
particular focus on the key assumptions therein, including discount rate and long-term growth rate with the 
involvementofourownvaluationspecialist;
• We have re-computed the goodwill arising from the business combination to determine the mathematical 
accuracy;
• We have assessed and challenged the key assumptions and basis of measurement of put option liability in relation 
totheacquisitionofTISSB;and
• Wehaveassessedtheadequacyofdisclosureinrespectofacquisitioninthefinancialstatementsasrequiredby
the relevant accounting standards.
b. Valuation of biological assets - Group and Company
RefertoNote5–Biologicalassets.
The key audit matter
TheGroupandCompanyheldRM133.28millionandRM36.22millionofbiologicalassetsrespectively,comprising
cows,goatherdsandbulls,measuredatfairvaluelesscosttosellasat31March2024.Indeterminingthefair
value of the biological assets, the Group and the Company used replacement cost approach and comparison 
approach. We have identified the valuation of biological assets as a key audit matter because the determination of 
thefairvaluesrequiredsignificantjudgementindeterminingthepriceperheadofcomparablebreed,weight,age
group and foreign exchange rate.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We performed the following audit procedures, amongst others:
• Wehaveperformedphysicalcountingofbiologicalassets;
• Wehaveevaluated thevaluationtechniquesadopted inestimating thefair value with referenceto the
requirementsofrelevantaccountingstandards,ourbusinessunderstandingandindustrypractice;
• Wehavecheckedthekeyinputsusedinthevaluationofbiologicalassetsreportasatyearend;
• Wehaveevaluatedthejudgement andthekeyassumptions pertaining totheprice perbiological asset of
comparablebreed,weight,agegroup,incidentalcostsandforeignexchangerateagainstmarketdata;
• We have interviewed the component auditor with regards to their findings and conclusions with regard to their 
work on biological assets and reviewed the component auditor’s documentation to evaluate the sufficiency and 
appropriatenessoftheauditevidence.Wehavealsoassessedthecompetencyofthecomponentauditor;and
• Wehaveassessedtheadequacyofdisclosureinthefinancialstatementsasrequiredbytherelevantaccounting
standards.

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors’ Report Thereon
TheDirectorsoftheCompanyareresponsiblefortheotherinformation.Theotherinformationcomprisestheinformation
included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our 
auditors’ report thereon.
OuropiniononthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompanydoesnotcovertheannualreportandwedo
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
InconnectionwithourauditofthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompany,ourresponsibilityistoread
the annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the annual report is materially inconsistent with the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materiallymisstated.If,basedontheworkwehaveperformed,weconcludethatthereisamaterialmisstatementofthe
annualreport,wearerequiredtoreportthatfact.Wehavenothingtoreportinthisregard.
Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements
TheDirectorsoftheCompanyareresponsibleforthepreparationoffinancialstatementsoftheGroupandofthe
CompanythatgiveatrueandfairviewinaccordancewithMFRSAccountingStandards,IFRSAccountingStandardsand
therequirementsoftheCompaniesAct2016inMalaysia.TheDirectorsarealsoresponsibleforsuchinternalcontrolas
theDirectorsdetermineisnecessarytoenablethepreparationoffinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompany
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
InpreparingthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompany,theDirectorsareresponsibleforassessingthe
ability of the Group and of the Company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
goingconcernandusingthegoingconcernbasisofaccountingunlesstheDirectorseitherintendtoliquidatetheGroup
or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
OurobjectivesaretoobtainreasonableassuranceaboutwhetherthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandofthe
Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report 
thatincludesouropinion.Reasonableassuranceisahighlevelofassurance,butisnotaguaranteethatanaudit
conductedinaccordancewithapprovedstandardsonauditinginMalaysiaandInternationalStandardsonAuditingwill
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
AspartofanauditinaccordancewithapprovedstandardsonauditinginMalaysiaandInternationalStandardson
Auditing,weexerciseprofessionaljudgementandmaintainprofessionalscepticismthroughouttheaudit.Wealso:
• IdentifyandassesstherisksofmaterialmisstatementofthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompany,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidencethatissufficientandappropriatetoprovideabasisforouropinion.Theriskofnotdetectingamaterial
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain anunderstanding ofinternal control relevant totheaudit inordertodesign audit procedures thatare
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal 
control of the Group and of the Company. 
• Evaluatetheappropriatenessofaccountingpoliciesusedandthereasonablenessofaccountingestimatesandrelated
disclosuresmadebytheDirectors.
Integrated Annual Report 2024 191

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
• ConcludeontheappropriatenessoftheDirectors’useofthegoingconcernbasisofaccountingand,basedonthe
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant 
doubtontheabilityoftheGrouporoftheCompanytocontinueasagoingconcern.Ifweconcludethatamaterial
uncertaintyexists,wearerequiredtodrawattentioninourauditors’reporttotherelateddisclosuresinthefinancial
statementsoftheGroupandoftheCompanyor,ifsuchdisclosuresareinadequate,tomodifyouropinion.Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluatetheoverallpresentation,structureandcontentofthefinancialstatementsoftheGroupandoftheCompany,
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
• Obtainsufficientappropriateauditevidenceregardingthefinancialinformationoftheentitiesorbusinessactivities
within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
WecommunicatewiththeDirectorsregarding,amongothermatters,theplannedscopeandtimingoftheauditand
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
WealsoprovidetheDirectorswithastatementthatwehavecompliedwithrelevantethicalrequirementsregarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relations and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
FromthematterscommunicatedwiththeDirectors,wedeterminethosemattersthatwereofmostsignificanceinthe
audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit 
matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes the public disclosure about 
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our 
auditors’reportbecausetheadverseconsequencesofdoingsowouldreasonablybeexpectedtooutweighthepublic
interest benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
InaccordancewiththerequirementsoftheCompaniesAct2016inMalaysia,wereportthatthesubsidiariesofwhichwe
have not acted as auditors are disclosed in the Note 7 to the financial statements.
OTHER MATTER
ThisreportismadesolelytothemembersoftheCompany,asabody,inaccordancewithSection266oftheCompanies
Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of 
this report.

2 – Disclosures of Accounting Policies from1April2023.Theamendmentsrequirethedisclosureof‘material’,
ratherthan‘significant’, accounting policies. Theamendments alsoprovideguidanceontheapplication of

4.2 Material accounting policy information
(a) Recognition and measurement
All right-of-use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated

(b) Recognition exemption
TheGrouphaselectednottorecogniseright-of-useassetsandleaseliabilitiesforshort-termleasesthat
havealeasetermof12monthsorlessandleasesoflow-valueassets.TheGrouprecognisesthelease
payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease 
separately.Itassessestheleaseclassificationofasubleasewithreferencetotheright-of-useassetarising
fromtheheadlease,notwithreferencetotheunderlyingasset.Ifaheadleaseisashort-termleaseto

Thefairvalueofsemenandembryoscannotbemeasuredreliablyasthereisnoactivemarketandtransaction
dataavailable.Thesemenandembryoswereboughtforownusetoimprovethegeneticqualityofthedairy

TheDirectorsmonitoronthekeyfactorsindeterminingthefairvaluesuchascomparablesalespriceand
foreign exchange rate affecting import price as part of their financial risk management on biological assets. 
5.2 Material accounting policy information
(a) Dairy cows and goats
TheGroup’s biological assets comprise dairy herds, bulls anddairy goats. The biological assets are
measuredatcostoninitialrecognitionandsubsequentlyattheendofthereportingperiodattheirfair
value less costs to sell, with any resulting gain or loss recognised in profit or loss for the year in which it 
arises.
Thefeedingcosts,incurredforraisingofheifersandcalvesarecapitalised,untilsuchtimeastheheifers
and calves begin to produce milk.
TheGroupdetermineswhetheranactiveorothereffectivemarketexistsforabiologicalassetinits
presentlocationandcondition,andwhetherthereisaquotedpriceinthatmarketastheappropriatebasis
fordeterminingthefairvalueofthatasset.IfanactivemarketdoesnotexistthentheDirectorsuseone
of the following valuation methods, when available, in determining fair value:
• the most recent market transaction price, provided that there has not been a significant change in 
economiccircumstancesbetweenthedateofthattransactionandtheendofthereportingperiod;or
• marketprices,inmarketsaccessibletotheentity,forsimilarassetswithadjustmenttoreflectdifferences.
(b) Semen and embryos

ThekeyassumptionsusedintheFVLCTScalculationsareasfollows:
(a) Revenuegrowth–thebasisusedtodeterminefutureearningspotentialarehistoricalsalesand
expectedgrowthintheCPGbusinessandnewretailTISSBoutlets;
(b) Projectedgrossmargins–grossmarginsareprojectedbasedonthehistoricalmarginachievedor
predeterminedprofitmarginfortheproducts;
(c) Discountrates–thepre-taxdiscountratesof13%appliedtothecashflowprojectionsarederived
from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium at the date of assessment of the respective 
CGUs;
(d) Terminalgrowthrate–theterminalgrowthrateof0.5%useddoesnotexceedthelong-termaverage
growthrateoftherespectiveindustry;and
(e) Capitalexpenditure–projectedcapitalexpenditureforthenewretailoutletsandCPGbusinessplant

Basedonthemanagementassessment,noimpairmentlossisrequiredastherecoverableamountwas
higher than carrying amount. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
key assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the aggregate

VIUcalculationsapplyadiscounted cashflowsmodelusingcashflowprojectionsbasedonfinancial
budgets approved by management covering five-year period.
Thekeyassumptionsusedinthevalueisusecalculationsareasfollows:
(a) Revenuegrowth–thebasisusedtodeterminefutureearningspotentialarehistoricalsalesand
expectedgrowthintheice-creamproducts;
(b) Projectedgrossmargins–grossmarginsareprojectedbasedonthehistoricalmarginachievedor
predeterminedprofitmarginfortheproducts;
(c) Discountrates–thepre-taxdiscountratesof13%appliedtothecashflowprojectionsarederived
from the cost of capital plus a reasonable risk premium at the date of assessment of the respective 
CGUs;and
(d) Terminalgrowthrate–theterminalgrowthrateof0.5%useddoesnotexceedthelong-termaverage
growth rate of the respective industry.
Basedonthemanagementassessment,noimpairmentlossisrequiredastherecoverableamountwas
higher than carrying amount. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these 
key assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed the aggregate 
recoverable amount.

27. OPERATING SEGMENTS
TheGrouphastworeportablesegments,asdescribedbelow,whicharetheGroup’sstrategicbusinessunits.The
strategicbusinessunitsareindifferentgeographiesandaremanagedseparatelybecausetheyrequiredifferent
marketingstrategies.Foreachofthestrategicbusinessunits,theChiefOperatingDecisionMaker(“CODM”)(i.e.the
Group’sManagingDirectorandGroupChiefExecutiveOfficer)reviewsinternalmanagementreportsatleastona
quarterlybasis.ThefollowingsummarydescribestheoperationsineachoftheGroup’sreportablesegments:
• Malaysia’soperation Includesrearingofdairycowsandgoats;andproduction,marketingandsaleofcow’s
and goat’s milk, yogurt, plant-based, ice-cream and other relatedproducts; and
agrotourism.
• Australia’soperation Includesrearingofdairycows,productionandmarketingandsaleofcow’smilk,jam,
sauces, butter and yogurt.
Performance is measured based on segment profit or loss before tax, finance income, finance costs, depreciation 
andamortisation,asincludedintheinternalmanagementreportsthatarereviewedbyCODM.Segmentprofitis
used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the 
results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
Segmentassetsandliabilitiesinformationisneitherincludedintheinternalmanagementreportsnorprovided
regularlytotheGroupManagingDirector.Hence,nodisclosureismadeonsegmentassetsandliabilities.

TheGrouphasexposuretothefollowingrisksfromitsfinancialinstruments:
• Credit risk
• Liquidityrisk
• Market risk
28.4 Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
itscontractualobligations.TheGroup’sandtheCompany’sexposuretocreditriskarisesprincipallyfromits
receivablesfromcustomers.Inaddition,theCompanyhasexposuretocreditriskarisingfromadvancesto
subsidiariesandfinancialguaranteesgiventobanksforcreditfacilitiesgrantedtosubsidiaries.Thereareno
significant changes as compared to prior period.
Trade receivables
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.  
Creditevaluationsareperformedoncustomersrequiringcreditoveracertainamount.
At each reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether any of the trade receivables are credit 
impaired.
Thegrosscarryingamountsofcreditimpairedtradereceivablesarewrittenoff(eitherpartiallyorfull)when
there isnorealistic prospect ofrecovery. This isgenerally the case when the Group orthe Company
determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash 
flowstorepaytheamountssubjecttothewrite-off.Nevertheless,tradereceivablesthatarewrittenoffcould
stillbesubjecttoenforcementactivities.
Therearenosignificantchangesascomparedtopriorperiod.

Trade receivables (continued)
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at the end of the reporting period, there was no significant concentrations of credit risk and maximum 
exposure to credit risk arising from trade receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries are represented by the 
carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
Inmanagingcreditriskoftradereceivables,theGroupmaintainsseparateageinganalysisinrespectoftrade
receivables.
Themanagement hastaken reasonable steps toensure thatreceivables thatareneither pastduenor
impaired are measured at their realisable values. A significant portion of these receivables are regular 
customersthathavebeentransactingwiththeGroupandtheCompany.TheGroupandtheCompanyuse
ageinganalysistomonitorthecreditqualityofthereceivables.TheGroupandtheCompanygrantcredit
period ranging from 7 to 75 days from invoice date or month-end date. Hence, any receivables having 
significant balances past due more than 90 days, shall be considered as credit impaired and monitored 
individually.
TheGroupandtheCompanyuseanallowancematrixtomeasureexpectedcreditlosses(“ECLs”)oftrade
receivables.
Loss rates are calculated using a ‘roll rate’ method based on the probability of a receivable progressing 
throughsuccessivestagesofdelinquencyto90dayspastdue.
Lossratesarebasedonactualcreditlossexperienceoverthepastthreeyears.TheGroupandtheCompany
alsoconsiderdifferencesbetween(a)economicconditionsduringtheperiodoverwhichthehistoricdatahas
beencollected,(b)currentconditionsand(c)theGroup’sandtheCompany’sviewofeconomicconditionsover
the expected lives of the receivables. Nevertheless, the Group and the Company believe that these factors are 
immaterial for the purpose of impairment calculation for the year.
ThefollowingtableprovidesinformationabouttheexposuretocreditriskandECLsfortradereceivablesas
at the end of the reporting period which are grouped together as they are expected to have similar risk 
nature.

Cash and cash equivalents
Thecashandcashequivalentsareheldwithbanksandfinancialinstitutions.Asattheendofthereporting
period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statement of 
financial position.
Thesebanksandfinancialinstitutionshavelowcreditrisks.Inaddition,someofthebankbalancesareinsured
bygovernmentagencies.Consequently,theGroupandtheCompanyareoftheviewthatthelossallowance
are not material and hence, it is not provided for.
Other receivables
Creditrisksonotherreceivablesincludethedepositspaidtosuppliersandforutilities.TheGroupandthe
Company monitor the exposure to credit risk on individual basis.
As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying 
amountsinthestatementoffinancialposition.Thereisnohistoryofdefaultonotherreceivablesandthere

certainsubsidiaries.TheCompanymonitorsonanongoingbasistheresultsofthesubsidiariesandrepayments
made by the subsidiaries.
Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
ThemaximumexposuretocreditriskamountstoRM36,851,000(2023:RM49,007,000)representingthe
outstanding banking facilities of a subsidiary as at the end of the reporting period.
As at the end of the reporting period, there was no indication that the subsidiary would default on repayment.
Thefinancialguaranteeshavenotbeenrecognisedsincethefairvalueoninitialrecognitionwasnotmaterial.
Recognition and measurement of impairment loss
TheCompanyassumesthatthereisasignificantincreaseincreditriskwhensubsidiaries’financialposition
deteriorates significantly. TheCompany considers afinancial guarantee tobecredit impaired when the

28.6 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other 
price risk that will affect the Group’s and the Company’s financial position or cash flows.
Currency risk
TheGroup and theCompanyareexposed toforeigncurrencyriskonsalesand purchasesthatare
denominated in acurrency other than the respective functional currencies ofthe Group entities.The
currenciesgivingrisetothisriskareprimarilyUSDollar(“USD”),SingaporeDollar(“SGD”),Euro(“EUR”)and
AustralianDollar(“AUD”).
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
TheGroupandtheCompanyuseforwardexchangecontractsfromtimetotimetohedgeitsforeigncurrency
risk. Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the end of the 
reportingperiod.Wherenecessary,theforwardcontractsarerolledoveratmaturity.TheGroupandthe
Company entered forward exchange contracts with notional contract amount of RM217,000 (2023:
RM55,126,000)andRM217,000(2023:RM5,075,000)respectivelyinordertomanagetheforeigncurrency
exposures.
ForeignexchangeexposuresintransactionalcurrenciesotherthanthefunctionalcurrencyoftheGroupand
the Company are kept to an acceptable level.
