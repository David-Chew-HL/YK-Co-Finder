Commentary on revenue 
The lower Group revenue in the current quarter was mainly due to lower contributions from the food retail, 
property and services segments. 
 Retail 
The lower revenue within the retail segment was mainly due to the drop in revenue in the food retail 
business, primarily stemming from the boycott of Starbucks' cafes arising from the Middle East conflict. 
The non-food retail business reported an increase i n revenue in the current quarter under review. 
Despite a revenue decline in its reporting currency, Sterling Pound, H.R. Owen Plc ("HR Owen") 
reported an increase in revenue due to the favourable foreign exchange impact when converted into 
Ringgit Malaysia. 
Property 
The property segment reported lower revenue in the current quarter, mainly due to lower sales of 
overseas residence units comparing to the previous year corresponding quarter. 
 
 Hospitality 
The hospitality segment reported higher revenue mainly due to the higher overall average room rates 
and the full three months' revenue from the Iceland Parliament Hotel, which commenced its 
operations in December 2022, when compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. 
Services 
The services segment reported a lower revenue in the current quarter. This was mainly due to the 
lower revenue reported by the gaming business, which is operated by STM Lottery Sdn Bhd ("STM 
Lottery"). The drop in revenue was mainly due to lesser number of draws conducted (42 draws versus 
48 draws in last year corresponding quarter). However, this was mitigated by the higher revenue 
recorded by the managed telecommunication network service business, attributed to the higher 
project activities under the Universal Service Provision project.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE BURSA SECURITIES LR 
Commentary on results 
The Group reported a pre-tax loss in the current quarter under review as opposed to a pre-tax profit in the 
previous year corresponding quarter. This was mainly due to lower results from food retail, property and 
services segments, as well as higher finance costs. 
 
 Retail 
 The retail segment reported a pre-tax loss as opposed to a pre-tax profit in the corresponding quarter of 
the previous year. This shift can be attributed primarily to the pre-tax loss reported by the food retail 
 business, along with the higher pre-tax loss incurred by the non-food retail business. 
 
The pre-tax loss for the food retail business was primarily due to the lower revenue registered, as 
mentioned earlier under commentary on revenue. 
 
The higher pre-tax loss for the non-food retail business was mainly attributed to HR Owen's higher 
pre-tax loss. This was primarily due to lower revenue coupled with higher operating expenses resulting
from inflationary pressures. Additionally, higher depreciation charge following the completion and ful l 
operation of the Hatfield Centre contributed to the  loss. Furthermore, HR Owen's results were 
negatively impacted by higher finance costs arising from interest rate hike and higher stocking loans 
in the current quarter under review. 
Property 
The property segment reported a lower pre-tax profit mainly due to lower sales of overseas residence 
units. 
Hospitality 
The improved results reported by the hospitality segment was mainly due to the reasons mentioned 
above in the current quarter under review of the commentary on revenue. 
Services 
The services segment reported lower pre-tax profit in the current quarter was mainly due to lower 
sales achieved, higher prize payout coupled with higher operating expenses incurred in the current 
quarter under review.

Review of results for the financial period 
The Group registered a revenue of RM4.80 billion and pre-tax loss of RM12.86 million for the financial
period ended 31 December 2023 as compared to a revenue of RM4.58 billion and pre-tax profit of RM199.67  
million reported in the previous year corresponding period. 
Commentary on revenue 
The Group registered higher revenue in the current period mainly due to the higher revenue recorded from 
hospitality, services and non-food retail segments.  
Retail 
The higher revenue for the non-food retail business  was primarily contributed by HR Owen. Although 
HR Owen's revenue in the current period was on par with the previous year's corresponding period, the 
favourable foreign exchange effect resulted in a revenue increase of 10.1% when converted to Ringgit 
Malaysia. 
The lower revenue from food retail business was mainly due to the reason mentioned in the review 
of results for the current quarter. 
Property 
The property segment reported slightly lower revenue in the current quarter, primarily due to lower 
sales of overseas residence units. However, this decline was mitigated by the increased sales of local
residence units. 
Hospitality 
The hospitality segment reported higher revenue mainly due to the higher overall average room rates 
and the revenue from the Iceland Parliament Hotel which operated for the whole six months in the 
current quarter under review. 
Services 
The higher revenue was mainly contributed by the higher project activities reported by the managed 
telecommunication network service business as menti oned in the review of results for current quarter. 
Additionally, STM Lottery reported a marginal increase in revenue despite conducting fewer draws 
during the current period under review. This growth was attributed to higher sales per draw, driven by
the increased sales from the higher accumulated jackpot prizes.

Commentary on results 
The Group reported a pre-tax loss in the current period under review mainly due to lower results from retail, 
property and services segments, as well as high finance costs. 
 
Retail 
The lower results reported by the non-food retail business were mainly due to HR Owen. HR Owen 
reported a pre-tax loss of RM15.5 million, as opposed to a pre-tax profit of RM10.9 million in the same 
period of last year. This was mainly attributed to higher operating costs resulting from inflationary 
pressures, coupled with higher depreciation charge following the completion and full operation of the 
Hatfield Centre. Additionally, the impact of the UK interest rate hike on the higher stocking loans 
drawdown in the current period under review contributed to the pre-tax loss. 
The lower pre-tax profit reported by the food retail business was mainly due to the reason mentioned 
above in the quarterly review section. 
Property 
The property segment reported a lower pre-tax profit mainly due to lower sales of overseas residence 
units in the current period under review. 
Hospitality 
The pre-tax profit from the hospitality segment was in tandem with the higher revenue reported in the 
current period under review. 
Services 
The lower pre-tax profit from the services segment was mainly due to the higher prize payout coupled 
with higher operating expenses incurred in the current period under review.

RM114.84 million as compared to a revenue of RM2.57 billion and pre-tax profit of RM101.99 million rep orted in  
the preceding quarter. 
Commentary on revenue 
 The Group registered a lower revenue in the current quarter mainly contributed by the retail, hospitality and 
services segments. 
Retail 
 The non-food retail business reported lower revenue  as HR Owen's sales soften in the current quarter 
as compared to the preceding quarter. HR Owen's revenue declined mainly due to lower number of 
units of car sold from both new and used car sector s, partly caused by reduced luxury spending against
the backdrop of challenging economic conditions in the United Kingdom. 
 
The food retail business reported a lower revenue i n the current quarter under review. The lower 
revenue registered was mainly due to the boycott of Starbucks' cafes arising from the conflict in the 
Middle East. 
Property 
The property segment reported higher revenue in the current quarter as compared to the preceding 
quarter mainly due to higher progress billings. 
Hospitality 
The lower revenue registered from the hospitality segment due to the lower overall occupancy rates 
and average room rates in the current quarter under review. This was due to the onset of monsoon 
season in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the winter season in Iceland. 
 
Services 
The services segment reported a lower revenue mainly due to lower revenue reported by STM Lottery. 
The higher sales in the preceding quarter benefitte d from the higher accumulated jackpot prizes.

Malaysia's economic growth is expected to be driven by moderate domestic demand and the moderation of 
average inflation rate despite the uncertainties ar ising from geo-political tensions. 
The management of NFO business segment of the Group is of the view that the NFO business in Malaysia will 
continue its upward trajectory of per draw sales growth driven by favourable consumer spending during the 
festive period and continued consumer interest in t he jackpot games. With the complete closure of the Group's 
NFO outlets in Kedah and Perlis, the management of NFO business segment of the Group is disheartened b y the 
encroachment of illegal operators in these underser ved areas due to the absence of legal NFO operators. 
The performance of the business segments of the Group is expected to improve on the back of moderate 
consumer spending, rebound of tourism activities an d better-than-expected labour market conditions. The 
Group will monitor the prevailing global and local political development in the countries where the Gr oup has 
business operations. 
Taking into account of the aforesaid and barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Directors are 
cautiously optimistic that the performance of the b usiness operations of the Group for the remaining q uarters 
of the financial year ending 30 June 2024 to be satisfactory.

(c) Note 38.3.1 regarding the Amat Muhibah Tax Dispute (continued) 
AMSB did not agree with the basis applied by the IRB and had filed an official appeal against the 
additional assessment for YA2017 through submission  of the prescribed Form Q to the Special 
Commissioners of Income Tax ("SCIT"). SCIT had fixed the trial on 25 March 2024 and 26 March 2024. 
On 1 July 2021, AMSB wrote to the Ministry of Finance Malaysia ("MOF"), requesting MOF: 
(a) to give a general character direction to Director General of Inland Revenue ("DGIR") as to the exercise 
of the functions of the DGIR under Section 135 of t he ITA 1967 and for the DGIR to give effect to the 
direction so given; or 
(b) to grant an exemption under Section 127(3A) of the ITA 1967 with regards to Tax in Dispute, within 
the week. 
As MOF did not respond to AMSB's request, AMSB had filed an application to the High Court of Kuala 
Lumpur ("High Court") for judicial review against MOF on 8 July 2021 ("MOF Judicial Review"). The High 
Court fixed 15 September 2021 for the first hearing of the MOF Judicial Review. AMSB had also been granted 
an interim stay on the payment of the Tax in Dispute until 15 September 2021. Subsequently, the hearing date 
had been rescheduled to 25 July 2022 and an interim  stay had been granted till then. At the hearing on 
25 July 2022, the High Court granted leave for AMSB's application of judicial review and a stay until the 
full and final determination of the judicial review  application. 
On 8 August 2022, IRB informed the High Court that it had filed an application to intervene ("IRB 
Application to Intervene"). At the hearing on 2 February 2023, the High Court had allowed IRB Application 
to Intervene. 
On 11 October 2022, the Attorney General Chambers informed the High Court that it had filed an appeal 
at the Court of Appeal against the High Court's decision to grant leave for the MOF Judicial Review ("AGC 
Appeal"). 
At 26 July 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed MOF's request to consolidate the AGC Leave Appeal with 
22 other appeals. 
At the most recent case management held on 5 February 2024, the Court of Appeal fixed the hearing for 
AGC Leave Appeal to be on 21 May 2024 and 23 May 2024. 
As for the MOF Judicial Review, the High Court was informed of the hearing dates of the AGC Leave Appeal. 
The High Court then instructed both parties to atte nd case management on 27 May 2024 to update the High 
Court on the outcome of the AGC Leave Appeal. 
Based on the opinion obtained from its legal adviso rs, AMSB has an arguable case that the IRB has no 
legal and factual basis to raise the Tax in Dispute.
