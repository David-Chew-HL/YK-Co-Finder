Overview 4Axiata Group Berhad • IAR 2023
Reporting Philosophy
The Axiata Group Berhad’s (‘ Axiata’, ‘the Group’ or ‘ Axiata Group’) Integrated Annual Report (IAR), which forms part of the 2023 Reporting Suite, is a comprehensive 
resource for understanding our company’s approach to creating and preserving stakeholder value while also managing the risk of value erosion in the short, 
medium and long term. The report highlights how we are paving the way to become the Next Generation Digital Champion by building a connected and digital 
Asia, focusing on community, business and public sector transformation. It is targeted primarily for investors but is also informative for a broader audience.
BASIS OF THIS REPORT
Certain OpCos also produce standalone reports, offering additional detailed insights.
Integrated Thinking and Reporting Process
This IAR reflects Axiata’s Group-wide effort to 
incorporate integrated thinking principles into our 
strategy, business model and value creation. This 
approach enables effective integration of Axiata’s 
Corporate Strategy, aligning with our shared aspiration 
of becoming a Sustainable Dividend Company. This 
IAR showcases the interconnected disclosures and 
linkages within this report and others in our Reporting 
Suite.
Materiality
We disclose information on material matters 
influencing value creation and preservation across 
the short, medium and long-term horizons. A 
comprehensive assessment is conducted every two 
years, complemented by annual reviews, to review 
our material matters against updated regulatory and 
benchmark disclosure requirements. Throughout the 
reporting year, no major external factors required 
changes to our material matters, nor were there any 
significant shifts in our business model or operational 
context. For clarity, the material matters assessment 
in 2022 took into consideration the acquisition of Link 
Net and the demerger of CelcomDigi. 
In 2023, the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) 
reaffirmed the 16 sustainability-related material 
matters identified in 2022. Our strategic response to 
managing these material matters is detailed in this 
report and our Sustainability & National Contribution 
Report.
Enhancing Sustainability Integration and 
Disclosures
We incorporate sustainability into our business 
practices to generate long-term value. We take into 
account the potential risks and impacts of ESG when 
developing our strategies and initiatives across our 
markets. Our ESG practices and disclosures align with 
global and local sustainability standards (see Reporting 
Suite for details), informed by key indicators from 
recognised ESG ratings such as the Carbon Disclosure 
Project (CDP) Worldwide, S&P Global Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment (CSA), FTSE4Good Bursa 
Malaysia, MSCI and Digital Inclusion Benchmark (DIB).
Scope and Boundary
Integrated Reporting Boundary
Covers the Group’s strategic activities, business 
model, operating context, financial and non-
financial performance and outcomes that influence 
our capacity for value creation. It focuses on the 
five Vectors of Value Creation that underpin the 
performance of our Triple Core Business: Digital 
Telcos, Infrastructure and Digital Businesses. 
Financial Reporting Boundary
Covers the Group’s governance details, audited 
financial statements, and essential regulatory-
required information.
Sustainability Reporting Boundary
Covers the Group’s material sustainability 
performance across our business. It focuses on 
the incorporation of the Axiata Sustainability 
Framework and the 3-year TCFD roadmap 
in enhancing our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) efforts.
Our Reporting Suite
All three reports cover the performance of the Group 
across its operating footprint in ASEAN and South 
Asia, which includes Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, 
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, Myanmar, Laos, the 
Philippines, as well as the broader geography covered 
by the digital advertising and analytics businesses. 
The reporting period covered is from 1 January to  
31 December 2023, including significant events up to 
31 March 2024, where material. These reports include 
performance reviews of CelcomDigi Berhad, which 
became a Key Associate Company on 1 December 
2022, but do not include reviews on Ncell Axiata, which 
was sold on 1 December 2023. The financial reviews 
of both companies are provided in the Governance & 
Audited Financial Statements 2023. For a full overview, 
we encourage stakeholders to collectively review the 
three specified reports listed.

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE

the Chairman’s Message
ADVANCING TO 
A SUSTAINABLE 
FUTURE
Dear Stakeholders, 
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the 
Board), I am pleased to share my thoughts 
on Axiata Group Berhad’s (‘ Axiata’ or ‘the 
Group’) progress, particularly at this notable 
moment in its transformative journey. In recent 
years, there has been a significant shift in the 
operating landscape. The rapid advancement 
of digital technologies and artificial intelligence 
(AI) has steered consumer expectations 
towards more integrated, personalised and 
innovative digital experiences. The challenging 
macro  environment, ever-increasing data 
consumption, changing market structure and 
evolving regulatory landscape are further 
driving the need to diversify business models 
and expand into broader digital services and 
solutions. 
In 2023, Axiata navigated a challenging  
operating landscape underlined by 
macroeconomic, political and social 
developments. The year was marked by 
disruptions in trade flows, inflationary pressures, 
forex volatility, tightened monetary policies 
as well as geopolitical tensions and regulatory 
changes. These circumstances fostered an 
uncertain operating environment across 
Axiata’s operating markets, particularly in the 
frontier or developing markets.
Axiata faced these challenges with adaptive 
strategies and a commitment to creating 
sustainable value for the long term. This 
has also compelled the Group to carefully 
evaluate its portfolio and make difficult calls 
in markets where the environment is seen to 
be deteriorating considerably, and redirect its 
resources towards businesses and geographies 
that are more sustainable and opportune. 
Towards that end, the Group had to make 
painful but necessary decisions to exit certain 
markets and refocus capital and efforts on more 
promising opportunities. Ncell was divested to 
avoid further regulatory and tax risks in Nepal, 
while EDOTCO’s decision to exit its business in 
Myanmar aims to mitigate further value erosion 
in a deteriorating environment.
Tan Sri Shahril Ridza Ridzuan
Chairman
“The Group stands at the core of rapid technological and 
societal change propelled by digital transformation. It is 
uniquely positioned to actively drive this evolution.”
Transformative Strides
For Axiata, getting it right matters. The Group 
stands at the core of rapid technological 
and societal change, propelled by digital 
transformation and AI. It is uniquely positioned 
to actively drive this evolution on the back 
of the over 162 million customers it serves. 
Axiata is steering the change by navigating the 
complexities of macroeconomic developments 
with its risk management strategy. This 
proactive stance ensures the Group evolves in 
sync with the dynamic business environment 
and emerging trends. It is this deliberate 
approach that is shaping Axiata’s strategic 
transformation journey along the Telco-TechCo 
continuum. This journey will serve the Group’s 
aspiration for sustainable dividends, focusing 
on creating a balance sheet that delivers long-
term value to its shareholders.
The transformation is well underway, as the 
Group methodically refines its governance 
model, portfolio mindset and focuses its 
resources towards assets that can create future 
value.
For example, in Indonesia, Link Net is being 
structurally separated into a fixed broadband 
infrastructure company while XL into a 
converged mobile, fixed and content service 
provider. In Malaysia, Celcom and Digi have 
merged into CelcomDigi, forming the country’s 
largest telecommunications company, and 
Boost Bank secured regulatory approval to 
commence operations. EDOTCO expanded 
in the Philippines by acquiring towers from 
PLDT. Additionally, Hypernet Technologies was 
acquired to broaden the ICT services portfolio 
in Indonesia.
In 2023, the Group refined its approach under 
Axiata’s five vectors of value creation and five 
business strategies, and further strengthened 
its technology footprint across various digital 
domains and showcased its versatility to cater 
to broader consumer and enterprise needs. To 
ensure this direction is well supported, a Board 
Investment Committee was established to 
provide oversight into the strategic investments.  
Axiata is steering the

in 2023, offset by one-off impairment losses 
consequent to the exits from Nepal and Myanmar. 
The Group delivered on its headline targets on the 
back of stronger revenue and operational excellence 
initiatives in an inflationary and challenging operating 
environment. The Board is, therefore, pleased to 
announce a total dividend of 10.0 sen per share for 
the financial year ended 31 December 2023.
Driving Digital and Financial Inclusion
Digital acceleration has become increasingly critical 
for maintaining customer relationships and remaining 
relevant. The Group is committed to promoting 
equitable digital and socio-economic growth across 
its footprint markets. This includes expanding the 
positive economic impact, creating jobs and sharing 
knowledge. Axiata’s impact, reflected by supporting 
around 0.61 million job opportunities and contributing 
USD8.71 billion to the gross domestic product (GDP) 
across its markets, aligns with its commitment to 
Advancing Asia. The Axiata Foundation, advocating 
digital inclusion for a sustainable future, expanded 
its scope to include community and environmental 
initiatives, and impacted more than 13,400 people in 
2023. 
 
Regionally, Axiata is addressing the growing needs 
of its 162 million-plus users. However, there are still 
many who do not have equitable access to digital 
and financial inclusion. Boost Bank, with its recent 
approval to start operations as a digital bank, is 
poised to strategically bridge the gap in providing 
access to banking and financial services, particularly 
within underserved communities in Malaysia.
The Group collaborates closely with governments in 
the region to accelerate public sector transformation, 
improve service delivery to citizens, and enhance 
national cyber resilience through digital means. 
The public-private collaborations for the year 
included Dialog’s national-led Innovation Challenge 
in Sri Lanka; XL’s IoT advancements in Indonesia’s 
education, smart cities and healthcare systems; 
Smart’s contributions to Cambodia’s digital and 
cyber security initiatives; and Robi’s support for 
Bangladesh’s vision through datathons and its 
entrepreneurship programme, to name a few.
The Group’s four venture funds across Malaysia, 
Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh funded 43  
start-ups and ventures in 2023, driving innovation, 
fostering employment and accelerating digital 
transformation in these countries. 
Axiata premiered its inaugural INsights@Axiata 
forum, a gathering of thought leaders and technology 
professionals to explore ideas on advancing digital 
inclusion. The forum shed light on the emerging impact 
and ethical considerations of AI, the importance of 
cyber security in the digital age and highlighted the 
need for next-generation infrastructure solutions. 
These are all vital questions as communities, 
businesses and even governments grapple with the 
speed of change brought upon by digital technology. 
Axiata aims to play its part in this transformative 
journey by shaping and influencing the future of 
digital and financial inclusion in the region.

Strengthening Sustainability 
The definition of sustainability in the corporate 
world is ever-evolving. Yet, at its core, it is about 
adding value to the operating environment and its 
stakeholders. With this enduring principle in mind, 
the Group undertook several initiatives to advance 
its sustainability practices in 2023, especially in the 
areas of governance, digital inclusion and climate 
action.
Guided by Axiata’s Sustainability Framework, the 
Group enhanced its integration of environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) values across its 
operations. Axiata’s Board Sustainability Committee 
plays a crucial role in this effort, overseeing ESG 
strategies and the effective management of ESG 
matters. The Group, through the Board Risk and 
Compliance Committee (BRCC), implemented an 
ESG model across all OpCos in 2023 to efficiently 
track, monitor and prioritise key ESG-related and 
regulatory issues and risk management, ensuring 
they are aligned with the Group’s sustainability goals 
and material matters. An effectiveness testing and 
a maturity assessment of the Anti-Bribery Anti-
Corruption programme were conducted, which 
indicated a strong level of maturity and effectiveness.

CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE
landscape presents unique challenges with the rise 
of sophisticated cyber threats and evolving legal and 
regulatory frameworks for data privacy. In response, 
the Board of Directors strengthened its governance 
through the BRCC to oversee cyber security and 
data privacy policies, strategies and implementation. 
This strategic oversight aims to harmonise initiatives 
across the organisation and ensure that the 
organisation remains resilient. 
Axiata has been actively working to improve its 
cyber security capabilities under the Digital Trust 
and Resilience (DT&R) Strategy. The aim is to 
enhance cyber resilience and counter emerging 
cyber threats and risks. The Group completed the 
implementation of its security operations centre 
operating model, which has led to the creation 
of innovation and intellectual property, improved 
efficiency and cost savings. Axiata met the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) target 
maturity levels, which is a testament to the efforts 
put in place to strengthen cyber security. Currently, 
the Cyber Security Strategy (DT&R 2024-2026) is 
under revision to ensure Axiata remains future-fit.
In 2023, Axiata took steps to strengthen its data 
privacy framework in response to evolving legal 
and regulatory developments. Data Privacy offices 
were established in each OpCo and adopted the 
Three Lines of Defence model. The Group completed 
its strategic roadmap for data privacy, covering 
a three-year period, and is currently developing 
strategies for the next three years. The successful 
completion of strategic initiatives from the roadmap 
set the stage for developing the next plan, which is 
called #ASH 3.0, for the years 2024-2026. The new 
plan considers the evolving threat landscape and 
technological advancements, and emphasises the 
synergy between cyber and privacy capabilities to 
proactively manage data privacy risks and safeguard 
digital information.
Group-wide initiatives on AI and AI Factory will 
enable Axiata to expand its digital services and 
provide segment-of-one approach to its customers. 
The Group is committed to exploring the use of 
emerging technology such as Generative AI (GenAI) 
responsibly, ethically and in a way that benefits 
customers, employees and shareholders. The Axiata 
Board has approved GenAI principles and has 
adopted a risk-based approach to managing AI risks.
Axiata completed the integration of climate risk 
assessment based on the Task Force on Climate-
related Disclosures (TCFD) requirements into its 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) policy. It reviewed 
its carbon emissions baseline and set targets for the 
Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validation 
submission, in support of its Net-Zero and SBTi goals.

The Group made notable strides in executing its strategic direction, guided by 
Axiata’s five portfolio vectors and five business strategies, aimed at unlocking 
value and seizing new opportunities. The CelcomDigi Berhad (CelcomDigi) merger 
continues to unlock synergies and strengthen its market position, while in Indonesia, 
our delayering efforts are directed towards a FMC ServeCo and a fibre InfraCo to 
provide converged consumer offerings and create fibre infrastructure capabilities. 
We continue to build resilience in  Frontier Markets where operations have returned 
to pre-pandemic levels, expand the Infrastructure business, and illuminate value of 
our Digital Businesses with a focus on the path to profitability. 
Strategic focus was placed on directing resources and investments into growth 
sectors with improved cash flow. This delivered positive outcomes, reflected by the 
strong revenue performance in continuing operations 1 and Earnings Before Interest, 
Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) growth. 
Opting to divest from Nepal, while classifying our Myanmar operations as held 
for sale 2, was a strategic move to mitigate risks from a deteriorating operating 
environment, realign resources and focus on more stable markets. This reflected 
Axiata’s resolve and commitment to maximising shareholder value.
Revenue increased by 9.9%, with contributions from all Operating Companies (OpCos) 
except Digital Businesses. The focus for Digital Businesses remained on their path 
towards profitability and investments in Boost Bank in Malaysia. Digital Telcos have 
been increasing their revenue market share and improving monetisation through 
higher Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), reflective of market repair subsequent 
to market consolidation. Encouragingly, most of our Digital Telcos delivered one of 
their most profitable performances, while also gaining market share. 
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) increased over 100% to RM2.4 billion, 
driven by an 11.7% increase in EBITDA. Normalised Profit After Tax and Minority 
Interest (PATAMI)3 grew 94.1% to RM0.3 billion in 2023, mainly excluding foreign 
exchange and derivatives valuation, and goodwill and assets impairment.

How did Axiata’s strategy secure growth in 2023? (continued)
The Group outperformed its headline targets, achieving strong performance 
across its markets, even amid tough global economic challenges. Prudent 
management of capital expenditure (capex) at RM5.1 billion, which came in 
below the initial guidance of RM7.1 billion, combined with improved EBITDA, 
generated adjusted operating free cash flow of RM1.0 billion after accounting 
for leases.
We have a clear game plan to navigate macroeconomic challenges, such as rising interest rates, currency devaluation and 
inflationary pressures. This approach includes adopting strategic capital allocation, ensuring that investments are directed 
towards opportunities with the most significant returns, driving sustainable growth through structural transformation 
of the OpCos, and paring down USD debts in highly volatile forex markets and by asset monetisation. Efforts to build 
resilience will pay off as the macro environment improves.

Net Debt/EBITDA stood at 3.4x, mainly due to the classification of 
EDOTCO Myanmar as held for sale. We closed out 2023 with a consolidated 
cash balance of RM4.6 billion after proactive loan prepayment of  
RM2.2 billion, which yielded interest savings of RM82 million. This was in line 
with our strategy to reduce borrowings and improve the balance sheet.
We are ensuring greater cost and operational excellence by reinventing the 
operating model towards a leaner Axiata HoldCo structure, where the Axiata 
Corporate Centre now functions more efficiently with strong oversight through 
operational OpCo Boards. This shift ensures a focused approach towards 
managing optimum returns from its OpCos and achieving a cost reduction of 
approximately 20%.

growth. In furthering this ambition, we are applying several fundamental TechCo principles, including 
but not limited to Delayering, Softwarisation, Cloudification, Platforming and Zero-Touch Smart 
Partnering.
Axiata has been a pioneer in Delayering, of both Infrastructure as well as New Growth Businesses. 
We started our strategic delayering initiatives in 2013 by carving out our Tower Infrastructure and 
forming EDOTCO, which has since emerged as a key player in the regional telecommunications 
infrastructure sector. Similarly, since 2015, Axiata has established new growth frontiers through the 
initiation of substantive digital business in the spheres of Fintech, MarTech, AI and Analytics. More 
recently in 2019, we delayered our Software Development and Platforming capabilities to form 
ADL, our multi-country Software Development and Digital Transformation unit. In a similar vein, the 
delayering of our Fibre Assets in Link Net to form one of Indonesia’s largest FibreCo infrastructure  
players is our most recent foray in terms of infrastructure delayering.
Our network transformation strategy is an equally pivotal accelerator of our Telco-TechCo trajectory. 
Axiata’s network transformation strategy is designed to amplify capital returns through the application 
of TechCo principles alongside the adoption of cutting-edge technological advancements.
The multiple facets of our Telco-TechCo thrust are key to Axiata’s growth and competitiveness. Our 
Telco-TechCo thrust combines synergistically with other elements of Axiata’s five portfolio vectors 
and five business strategies, enabling us to address short-term and long-term shareholder value 
creation, mitigate capex escalation, and achieve a lower cost to serve.

Radical IT transformation is foundational to Axiata’s Telco-TechCo transition. Our underlying ambition, with respect to 
IT transformation, has been to accelerate the time to market of product and service innovation, enhance customer 
experience and responsiveness, and embrace hyperscalers and internal and external developer ecosystems through 
frictionless partnering capabilities. In combination, these capabilities serve to drive down IT costs and generate new 
revenue streams. Central to Axiata’s IT transformation is the adoption of an API-driven, Middleware and Micro-Services 
architecture, which also enables the creation of Platform Businesses in parallel with accelerating the end-to-end 
digitisation of our business processes.
Our Digital Telco Enabler (DTE) Platform and associated API and Micro Service Environments are built and maintained 
by ADL. 
 
Our pioneering approach to the Digital Telco architecture, supplemented by ADL’s DevOps capabilities, positions Axiata 
as a more flexible and competitive connectivity and ‘beyond connectivity’ digital services provider.

How has the Enterprise segment enhanced its abilities and expanded its services? Q7
Axiata Enterprise achieved strong growth with enterprise revenue increasing by 
double digits, supported by a wide range of ICT services. This growth builds on 
the groundwork laid in 2022, where the focus was on building a strong foundation 
in local ICT sales and delivery capabilities. The acquisition of H One and Hypernet 
by Axiata played a crucial role in this success. Axiata Enterprise realised synergy 
from H One and Hypernet to expand its ICT services, specifically in Microsoft Cloud, 
Managed Connectivity and Wi-Fi network services.
• Non-connectivity 
contribution grew by 
7%7
• Enterprise revenue 
growth of 23% YoY
How have you accelerated the AI transformation 
programme to be delivered at scale and generate value?Q8
Our strategy for deriving value from AI centres around several 
key building blocks. At its core lies the concept of AI-ready 
data, facilitated by our standardised Big Data Lake (BDL) 
architecture. The AI Factory serves as a purpose-built platform, 
where experts collaborate to develop, train and deploy AI 
models rapidly and at scale, addressing classic AI challenges. 
Simultaneously, we are integrating GenAI into this ecosystem. 
This integration aims to amplify the impact of AI across 
critical functions and business processes. Lastly, our extensive 
API marketplace acts as a bridge, seamlessly orchestrating 
interactions between the AI Factory and GenAI models. 
Whether it is front-office or back-office processes or classic AI 
use cases, our goal is to create maximum impact through these 
interconnected components.
 
To drive maximum value from our AI ecosystem, we have 
prioritised high-impact use cases both for AI Factory and 
GenAI. We have implemented impactful priority use cases 
within the AI Factory Production domain. These included 
predicting customer churn, managing retail stock, enhancing 
trade visibility, employing AI for network planning, optimising 
sales force route planning, and boosting revenue upselling 
and cross-selling. For GenAI, we are focusing on high-impact 
back office and front office transformation use cases, including 
coding assistant, sales and marketing productivity, autonomous 
customer service, marketing content generation, and customer 
co-pilot, among others.
Part of this expansion strategy involved seeking potential targeted acquisitions for capabilities and forming partnerships with technology 
services and solution providers. This approach keeps us ahead of the curve, considering the fast-changing technology landscape, and 
positions us well to support transitioning to the digital future.

What is the progress on efforts to strengthen 
Axiata’s value proposition to shareholders?Q9
IAR, Our Investor Proposition on page 8
What efforts have been put into strengthening the Winning 
Culture and building a future-fit organisation?Q11
Our refreshed Winning Culture will drive our success in winning in all 
our markets every day. In 2023, we amplified our Winning Culture 
framework, which is anchored on our long-standing guiding principles 
of  Uncompromising Integrity and Exceptional Performance (UI.EP). 
Uncompromising integrity has evolved to become our baseline and 
licence to play. 
The three new core values introduced under the Winning Culture, 
which are Obsession for Customers, Courage for Change, and Passion 
for Collaboration, reflect the need to adapt to changing times and the 
importance of agility in today’s dynamic business environment, paving 
the way for exceptional performance. These core values are designed to 
foster a culture that prioritises customer needs, embraces change and 
champions innovation, and promotes collaborative excellence. By drawing 
on the diverse strengths and expertise within our team, we are committed 
to cultivating a unified, inclusive work environment where everyone can 
thrive. The OpCos are defining and implementing initiatives to demonstrate 
the cultural shift towards these three core values.
This commitment is reflected in the results of the Employee Engagement 
Survey (EES) 2023, which showed a high participation rate of 90% and an 
75% favourable score. These results indicate a strong alignment between 
our employees and our core values, reflecting the positive impact of our 
efforts to strengthen the Winning Culture. 
Achieving a Winning Culture across the Group is one of my KPIs as the 
Group CEO, which underscores the importance we place on this in our 
overall strategy.

Our strategic direction for 2024 is to drive the execution of Axiata’s five portfolio vectors and five business strategies, 
centred around reinforcing our position in the market and setting the stage for future growth. The immediate aim is to 
reinforce foundational strengths and ensure we continue to meet the evolving needs of the market efficiently. This also 
involves a cultural shift within the Group to adapt to the changing landscape and aspirations.
Our priorities for the year include focusing on market repair and unlocking merger synergies through CelcomDigi. In 
Indonesia, we will further our delayering efforts on the structural transformation of XL Axiata and Link Net to deliver on 
the expanded home pass and establish a solid presence as a provider of converged mobile, fixed broadband and content 
services. We look forward to launching Boost Bank in Malaysia, set to redefine digital banking and, more importantly, 
contribute to expanding financial inclusion for the underbanked and unbanked communities. 
The Group will continue to explore market and industry consolidation opportunities to strengthen our competitive edge 
and market standing. We aim to capture value from the proposed Dialog and Bharti Airtel Limited merger, which will 
solidify our presence as a leading telecommunications company in Sri Lanka. 
Looking to the future, Axiata continues to lay the groundwork for long-term sustainability. Axiata’s five portfolio vectors 
and five business strategies will drive our transformation journey along the Telco-TechCo continuum, which is synonymous 
with innovation, digital services and next-generation solutions. 
In line with these strategic pursuits, we will continuously review our operations to streamline processes and actions 
that create value from these operations, and if required, attract new investors and monetise to pare down debt. As a 
company focused on growth, our increasing EBITDA is expected to support our leverage ratios.  
To track progress and maintain focus, Axiata has set clear KPIs for 2024:

Macroeconomic Factors
Operating Environment
• Economic challenges such as currency devaluation and inflation are impacting 
financial health and operational costs, affecting international purchasing power and 
profitability across markets
• Risks in both frontier and non-frontier markets, including armed conflicts, 
macroeconomic fallout, USD liquidity issues and political instability, present significant 
operational challenges
• Acceleration of 5G roll out leading to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) monetising 
their tower assets, which may attract competition into home markets 
• 5G roll out related capex investment, commensurate with monetisation of 5G network
Strategic Implications and Our Response
• Prolonged USD liquidity crisis in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh could weaken purchasing 
power and pose risks of delays or inability to repatriate dividends to Axiata, with 
financial impacts from debt conversion into local currencies
• High market risk in frontier markets necessitates cautious strategic planning and 
investment
• Higher borrowing costs for EDOTCO’s acquisition due to increased interest rates
• Adopt strategies such as hedging US debt with local currency, restructuring 
through market convergence and consolidation, and reducing strategic exposure by 
streamlining services to mitigate these risks
Way Forward
• Stringent capital management through Capital Management Framework
• Leverage market consolidation and synergise opportunities, with network sharing 
opportunities, particularly in Indonesia to drive strategic alignments
• For frontier markets, rebalance loans to reduce USD exposure, together with further 
price hardening, network collaboration and consolidation effort
• Engage actively with OpCos and banks to stay informed about local market liquidity 
and foreign exchange trends, and collaborate to explore potential solutions
Risks Our Strategic Response
V2 V3 V4 SP1
Regulatory
Operating Environment
• High interest rates and continued weakness of local currencies to the USD have influenced economic and fiscal 
responses
• Uncertain currency environment affecting policymaking and sectoral regulatory decisions, resulting in moves to 
increase general and sector specific taxes, such as Sri Lanka’s Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL)
• Changes in policymakers have the potential to significantly alter business operating environment
• Outcome of General Elections could result in policy shifts and uncertain outcomes
Strategic Implications and Our Response
• Combination of high interest rates, devaluation of local currencies against the USD and uncertainties of policy 
decisions on matters such as taxes could lead to increased operational costs affecting profitability
• Stringent regulatory requirements on Quality of Service (QoS) and coverage extension may require more 
investment in infrastructure, leading to higher capex but could affect future revenue streams
• Engaged with key government and regulatory stakeholders to effectively mitigate, influence and adapt to 
regulatory risks in their regulatory decisions, and advocate better policies through consultative processes and 
champion investments in frontier markets 
• Prioritised securing timely and affordable spectrum releases for 4G and 5G services and identifying new 
spectrum bands for the future
• Conducted regular advocacy sessions at regional and national-level regulators’ forums and thought leadership 
events to address issues such as spectrum, 5G licensing, taxation, digital competition, industry sustainability, 
open access, Network Fair Share and digital policy
• Secured direct engagement with the Malaysian Government for Axiata’s strategic and investment issues
• De-escalated stringent network QoS requirements in several markets and prevented unnecessary capex 
commitments
• Successfully advocated measured and careful retail tariff increases in several markets for market repair
Way Forward
• Aim to establish Indonesia Country Representative Office due to increased investment and operational activities 
to facilitate better strategic engagement, stronger franchise protection, improved opportunity scouting and 
leverage on strong bilateral links between Malaysia and Indonesia
• Accelerate cross-learnings and regulatory best practices through the Axiata Regulatory Expert Working Group 
(EWG)
• Support Axiata Telco-TechCo strategy by actively shaping national regulatory landscape, prioritise industry 
investment sustainability as top-of-mind issue, promote regulatory fairness and build competency in digital 
policies
• Proactively manage relationships with Bank Negara Malaysia (Central Bank of Malaysia), rating agencies, and key 
banks, improve engagement and ensure clear communication channels

THE CONTEXT OF OUR OPERATIONS
Hyper-Competition
Operating Environment
• Hyperscalers and OTT (Over-The-Top) platforms are 
increasing share of consumer spending and engagement, 
which suggests a shift in consumer preference towards 
advanced, internet-based services over traditional media 
and technology offerings
• As hyperscalers accelerate investment in cable and last 
mile solutions (i.e. satellite), they are increasing control on 
the telco value chain, although it is a lot lower in frontier 
markets
• Assigning spectrum to enterprise and system integrators 
for private network deployment is further reducing telco’s 
engagement and pricing power with large enterprises
• In-country consolidation and emerging price correction 
trends are reducing competition in the telco industry 
although dominant players still pressure smaller players in 
many markets, challenging their profitability
Strategic Implications and Our Response
• Investing in internal skills via ADL and platform solutions to 
regain control of systems and infrastructure, and increase 
engagement and share of spend of developer ecosystem
• Enhance Analytics/AI skills through the ACE programme 
and broaden DevOps capabilities within the Network 
Division, while utilising ADL to scale DevOps talent 
effectively
• Accelerate digital and IT transformation programme to 
improve time to market of new solutions
• Investing in AI and analytics to improve customer 
engagement
• Upskilling existing employees and creating attractive 
platforms such as ADL and ApiCo to attract best in class 
talents
Way Forward
• Deliver on the five vectors of value creation
• Adopt a measured and opportunistic approach to 
investments in 5G spectrum and infrastructure investments
• Work with other industry players on developing a 
healthy developer ecosystem that will drive creation and 
monetisation of 5G, Edge and Private Network solutions
• Maintain focus on digital acceleration moving towards 
implementation of AI and analytics solutions
• Implement network optimisation plans, including internal 
processes such as zero touch automation and external 
such as network sharing
• Maintain focus on achieving upside from CelcomDigi 
merger and structural transformation of Indonesia assets
• Collaborate on strategic partnerships with system 
integrators and hyperscalers
Operating Environment
• Geopolitical conflicts and increase in adoption of emerging technologies 
such as AI, Quantum computing, etc. are leading to increase in frequency 
and complexity of cyber attacks
• Emergence of 5G and Edge computing enables innovation and

CONSIDERING WHAT MATTERS
Materiality Assessment
Materiality assessments are crucial to 
our sustainability journey, allowing us to 
evaluate the Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) issues affecting our 
business and stakeholders. This process 
enables us to identify opportunities and 
mitigate risks associated with each material 
matter. Material sustainability issues serve as 
a strategic compass that guides our Board, 
leadership and the entire organisation in 
understanding and addressing the issues that 
impact us and our stakeholders. By aligning 
our strategies with the material matters 
and stakeholder needs, the leadership team 
can make informed decisions that foster 
sustainable development.
We conduct a detailed assessment every 
two years, with a yearly review in between, 
to ensure our focus on ESG matters 
aligns with our impact on society, the 
environment and our business growth. This 
includes stakeholder perspectives, current 
sustainability issues and changes to the 
industry and regulations.
Materiality Matrix
The materiality matrix below integrates input from Axiata and its

In 2023, as part of our annual review for validation, the Board Sustainability 
Committee (BSC) approved the existing 16 material matters, which were 
identified in FY2022, through a comprehensive materiality assessment across 
the Group. To enhance our disclosures, we have mapped the 16 material 
matters to Bursa Malaysia’s 11 common sustainability matters in 2023. 
The BSC’s approval was on the basis that throughout the reporting year, 
there were no major external factors that necessitated a material change 
to our identified material matters, nor were there any significant changes 
to our business model or operating context that warranted a change in the 
identified material matters. This is because the FY2022 assessment included 
Link Net and excluded CelcomDigi. Considering Axiata concluded its sale of 
Ncell on 1 December 2023, the material matters were still applicable for the 
majority of 11 months.

CASE STUDY
The Issue
In 2023, we faced volatile market conditions that complicated our financial budgeting. Challenges in the 
operating environment included managing forex risk across our nine markets due to depreciating local 
currencies against the USD, rising interest rates, and inflationary pressures amid changing regulations and 
the potential for a global recession.
Our Mitigation Plan
In May 2023, Axiata received a RM2.2 billion shareholder loan settlement. This influx of capital presented 
an opportunity for strategic debt management against the backdrop of an anticipated depreciating 
Ringgit. We considered various options for optimally allocating this capital to reduce financial risk while 
maximising Axiata’s financial health and operational flexibility.
How we achieve Financial Prudence through Strategic Debt 
Management
We recognise the importance of maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and as such, we prioritised the 
restructuring of our debt portfolio. We utilised the proceeds of the RM2.2 billion shareholder loan to 
reduce the Ringgit tranche of the existing Multi-Currency Term Loan facility by RM1.77 billion, which was 
due in December 2023. This effort alone generated interest savings of RM36 million and helped reduce 
the debt burden ahead of schedule.
In anticipation of further depreciation of the Ringgit, Axiata Treasury Management Centre leveraged on 
the financial benefits gained from the Celcom-Digi merger and pre-emptively allocated the final proceeds 
to partially fund the prepayment of USD100 million of the Company’s Multi-Currency Term Loan. This 
transaction was executed in September 2023, ahead of its original payment due date (June 2025), at 
an exchange rate of RM4.672 to the USD. This approach avoided approximately RM46 million in interest 
payments over the loan’s remaining tenure. This prepayment strategy was instrumental in mitigating the 
Group’s exposure to USD liabilities, which constituted about 58% of Axiata’s total debt portfolio as of the 
fourth quarter of 2023.
• Proactively mitigate exchange rate risk to safeguard against potential loss from currency depreciation
• Proactive settlement of debts yielded combined interest savings of RM82 million 
• Contribute to a healthier balance sheet, which could lead to better credit ratings and improved cost of 
borrowings

Risk Level:Risk Movement: StableRisk Category: Operational Risk
Context
• Operation and supply chain disruption resulting from environmental, geo-political and 
economic factors
• Reputational risk resulting from operational failure or service disruption
• Fluctuations in market demand, currency fluctuations, inflation or economic recession 
can further contribute to supply chain disruption
• Business continuity risk associated with natural disasters and other major disruptions 
such as pandemics, power outages, terrorist attacks and political instability
Impact
• Dependency on a few suppliers could limit Axiata’s efforts in building a resilient and 
sustainable supply chain capability
• Geo-political or economic shifts may cause delays, increase expenses, and affect 
product quality and consumer demand
OPERATIONAL RISK
Context
• Challenging emerging market’s macroeconomic and geopolitics landscape impacting 
forex and commodity costs
• Fragmented market structures and high infrastructure costs
• Rapid advancement of IR 4.0 and telco technologies
• Exponential growth in data consumption, offset by rising price competition and 
consumer price sensitivity, resulting in pressured margins with escalating costs and 
investment requirements
• Market repair via price hardening/optimisation would depend on market behaviour, 
which is unpredictable
• Intensified competition, particularly in Indonesia and Bangladesh, with aggressive 
pricing strategy
• Risk of potential inability to adapt swiftly and build sufficient resilience in the 
infrastructure and digital telco markets (Competition Risk)
• OpCos are mostly operating in developing markets, which are more susceptible to 
currency fluctuations and macroeconomic risks including rising inflation
• Shrinking market opportunities in a highly competitive and regulated industry (Industry 
Risk)
Impact
• Currency fluctuation may cause inflationary pressure, which could lead to shrinking 
consumer affordability (top line impact) and cost escalation, especially for USD-linked 
expenditures (bottom line impact), with potential implications to EBITDA in the short 
to medium-run
• Exponential data consumption growth and technological evolution intensifying, expected 
to translate into cyclical pressure on capex and product pricing in the long-run
• Market consolidation and price hardening driving ARPU upwards
• High competition and shift towards alternative technologies in Digital Marketing will 
require new approaches to secure top line and improve profitability
• Infrastructure business, especially in Malaysia, is challenged due to 2nd 5G network, and 
fixed broadband business in Indonesia continues to witness intense price competition 
with rapid expansion of naked fixed broadband providers

• The corporate exercises undertaken, including 
divestments in Nepal and Myanmar, were strategic 
responses to market opportunities, macroeconomic 
challenges and deteriorating environments. These 
moves aim to drive growth and reduce debt, and may 
temporarily impact our Financial Capital. However, they 
are important for improving Manufactured Capital and 
are set to enhance Intellectual and Human Capitals in the 
long run
• Axiata’s delayering strategy and progression along 
the Telco-TechCo path are designed to establish its 
leadership in integrating technology, unlocking new 
growth opportunities and enhancing capital returns. 
This journey necessitates investments in technology and 
network modernisation initiatives, which will enhance 
Manufactured, Intellectual and Human Capitals. Although 
these strategic investments may create short-term 
pressures on Financial Capital, they aim to strengthen 
long-term shareholder value
• Axiata’s aim to foster digital and financial inclusion is a 
strategic investment in Intellectual, Social & Relationship 
and Financial Capitals. Axiata enhances Intellectual 
Capital by driving innovation and knowledge sharing 
across its markets, creating jobs and contributing to the 
GDP of its footprint countries. This amplifies its Social 
& Relationship Capital by promoting equitable digital 
access and socio-economic growth. The launch of Boost 
Bank further illustrates Axiata’s role in improving financial 
access to underbanked and unbanked communities. 
These strategic commitments require carefully balancing 
Financial Capital by allocating resources toward 
sustainable value creation
• Axiata is committed to minimising its environmental 
impact, which directly supports its Natural Capital. This 
is done by aligning with TCFD recommendations and the 
SBTi pledge for 1.5°C, transitioning to renewable energy, 
and adopting environmentally friendly operational 
initiatives such as ‘outdoorisation’ that optimise the use 
of energy. This strategic focus involves a trade-off, as 
financial resources are directed towards these efforts 
and potentially impact short-term Financial Capital. 
However, these efforts will have a positive impact over 
time

1	T h e	Scope	1	and	Scope	2	GHG	emissions	of	Axiata	are	reported	based	on	the	GHG	Protocol’s	Corporate	Accounting	
and	Reporting	Standard	issued	by	the	World	Resource	Institute	and	World	Business	Council	for	Sustainable	Development.	
	 Axiata 	applies	the	operational	control	approach	in	accounting	for	emissions	from	those	sources	over	which	Axiata	
has	full	authority	to	introduce	and	implement	its	operating	policies,	which	includes	Axiata	and	its	subsidiaries.	Axiata’s	
reporting	boundary	excludes	the	digital	businesses	i.e.	Boost,	ADA	and	ADL	which	are	immaterial	to	the	Axiata	Group	
Berhad’s	overall	GHG	emissions.
2 The 2022 Scope 1 & 2 GHG emission had been restated due to changes in emission factors to reflect the latest 2022 IEA 
emission factors and organisational boundary due to merger of CelcomDigi and divestment of Ncell. Historical carbon 
emission data prior to 2022 based on previous methodologies are available in our previous SNCRs 
3 Direct carbon emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the Group
4 Indirect carbon emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, heating and cooling or steam purchased by the 
Group
Notes:
Overall, carbon emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 across the Group increased by approximately 8% in 2023. However, there 
was a 6.5% reduction in Scope 1 emissions YoY, primarily due to efforts by Dialog, XL and Smart to reduce fuel consumption 
by replacing generator sets with lithium batteries and increasing the number of solar sites.

Additional Information
Overview 56Axiata Group Berhad • IAR 2023
Group Financial Snapshot
The Group demonstrated resilient performance across its operations in FY2023. Despite the global economic challenges, the Group exceeded its revenue and EBIT headline targets. On continuing 
operations basis, most Operating Companies (OpCos) had strong revenue growth compared to FY2022. The Group saw a strong improvement in EBITDA and a substantial reduction in losses compared to 
the previous year. The Group’s strategic decisions, including exiting challenging markets in Nepal and Myanmar, have allowed it to concentrate on assets with potential future value, aligning with its goal of 
becoming a Sustainable Dividend Company. 
All financial data in this report relate solely to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Operating Revenue
• Group revenue improved by 9.9% to RM22,002.3 million 
for FY2023 with growth across all OpCos except for ADA 
and Boost 
• Key growth drivers were as follows:
- Higher data contribution at XL, Robi, Dialog and Smart
- Full year contribution from fixed broadband and cable 
TV business in Link Net, which was acquired by Axiata 
in June 2022
- New acquisition of towers in the Philippines, coupled 
with organic growth for EDOTCO
EBITDA
• Group EBITDA increased by 11.7% to RM9,628.9 million with 
improvement from all OpCos except ADA
• Growth in EBITDA was mainly driven by strong revenue growth
EBIT
• Group EBIT increased by more than 100% to RM2,428.9 million, flowing 
from higher top lines and lower impairment of goodwill of EDOTCO 
Pakistan of RM40.5 million as opposed to impairment of goodwill of XL 
and Dialog amounting to RM1,553.8 million in FY2022
PAT
• Group PAT for continuing operations improved by more than 
100% to a profit of RM142.2 million driven by higher top lines, 
lower foreign exchange losses and share of twelve (12) months 
results from CelcomDigi in FY2023 as compared to one (1) 
month in FY2022, partially offset by higher finance costs and 
taxes
CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Notes: 1 Others includes gain on disposal of towers, purchase price allocation (PPA) amortisation and one-off taxes
  2 Numbers are based on constant currency
COMBINED OPERATIONS
PATAMI
• Group PATAMI for combined operations fell by more than 
100% to a loss of RM1,994.8 million mainly due to the following 
reasons:
- Impairment of assets/ goodwill/ other write-off on Ncell 
and loss on disposal amounting to RM1,632.1 million and 
RM356.4 million respectively
- The Group’s intention to exit EDOTCO Myanmar, which 
resulted in impairment of assets amounting to RM489.4 
million. In addition, there was an impairment of goodwill in 
EDOTCO Pakistan amounting to RM25.5 million
- Gain on disposal of Celcom amounting to RM13,530.1 million 
in FY2022, with subsequent lower gain on disposal in FY2023 
amounting to RM402.0 million following the completion of 
final closing adjustments 
• Adjusting mainly for foreign exchange losses and derivatives, 
goodwill/assets impairment and other adjustments, Group 
normalised PATAMI for FY2023 stood at RM542.2 million

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Group Financial Position
As at 31 December 2023, the Group’s financial position remained resilient with a healthy cash balance at RM4.6 billion and dividend declared of 10.0 sen per ordinary share.
Note: 1	 Reynolds 	Group	consists	of	Reynolds	Holding	Limited	and	its	Nepal	CGU,	Ncell	Axiata	Limited
TOTAL EQUITY 
• Total equity stood at RM28.2 billion, 
decreased by RM2.4 billion
• Decrease in equity balance was mainly due 
to:
- Loss of RM2.5 billion for the financial 
year  
- Dividends to shareholders and non-
controlling interests of RM1.1 billion
- NCI impact from disposal of Reynolds 
Group1 of RM0.2 billion
- Decrease was partially cushioned by 
currency translation gains of RM0.9 billion 
mainly due to strengthening of certain 
OpCos’ local currencies against MYR 
and realisation of currency translation 
differences of RM0.4 billion from disposal 
of Reynolds Group
TOTAL LIABILITIES 
• Total liabilities stood at RM50.2 billion, 
decreased by RM0.8 billion
• Gross borrowing (excluding lease liabilities) 
decreased by RM0.6 billion mainly due 
to net repayments during the year and 
deconsolidation of Reynolds Group
• Current trade and other payables 
decreased by RM1.3 billion mainly due to 
the deconsolidation of Reynolds Group 
and settlement of Touch acquisition 
contingent consideration by EDOTCO
Partially offset by:
• Lease liabilities increased by RM1.7 billion 
mainly due to additions from XL
• Non-current trade and other payables 
increased by RM0.6 billion mainly due to 
Robi’s acquisition of 5G spectrum licence
CASH POSITION AND DIVIDENDS
• The Group’s cash balance stood at RM4.6 
billion
• As a result of strong operational performance 
supported by a resilient balance sheet and 
healthy cash balance, the Board of Directors 
approved a total dividend of 10.0 sen 
per ordinary share (FY2022: 10.0 sen per 
ordinary share, special dividend of 4.0 sen 
per ordinary share). The dividend payout 
ratio for FY2023 was 169%
CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CAPITAL 
RESOURCES
• The Group’s debt to equity gearing ratio 
(total borrowing including lease liabilities 
over total equity) stood at 1.3x as at 31 
December 2023
CAPITAL ALLOCATION 
• With Axiata’s multi-country presence, the Group uses the Capital Allocation Framework to guide 
capital allocation across our businesses into delivering Underlying PATAMI and Earnings Per Share, 
effectively translating into Total Shareholder Returns. The five guardrails of i) Country allocation, ii) 
Segment allocation, iii) Affordability, iv) Organic & Inorganic returns and v) Portfolio mix formed the 
foundation of our Capital Allocation Framework
• As the Group embarks on its next phase of growth guided by Axiata’s five portfolio vectors and five 
business strategies, a key aim is to increase transparency of cashflow at Axiata’s Holding Company 
level. The Capital Allocation Framework 2.0 was enhanced to serve as a guide for Axiata HoldCo on 
its sustainable cashflow deployment in order to achieve key financial outcomes of: 
- Delivering 10.0 sen DPS p.a to our shareholders and to progressively increase
- Retain credit rating with Moody’s (Baa2) and S&P (BBB)
- Achieve Net Debt/EBITDA target of 2.5x by end-2026
• As part of the Capital Allocation Framework 2.0, sources of funds have been clearly identified, which 
includes upstreaming of dividends from OpCos (including associates) and proceeds from asset 
monetisation/ value illumination opportunities in achieving the key financial outcomes
TOTAL ASSETS 
• Total assets stood at RM78.4 billion, decreased by RM3.2 billion
• Trade and other receivables decreased by RM2.1 billion mainly due to 
repayment of loan from an associate (CelcomDigi) amounting to RM2.4 
billion 
• Deposits, cash and bank balances decreased by RM2.8 billion mainly 
due to higher dividends paid to shareholders and lower receipts from 
customers, cushioned by lower payments to suppliers, purchase of PPE, 
investments in subsidiaries and repayment of loan from CelcomDigi
• Intangible assets decreased by RM1.2 billion, mainly due to:
- Impairment of intangible assets in Ncell and EDOTCO Group of RM1.1 
billion and RM0.4 billion respectively
- Deconsolidation of Reynolds Group of RM0.4 billion
- The decrease was partially cushioned by foreign exchange translation 
gains of RM0.4 billion as opposed to foreign exchange translation losses of 
RM0.8 billion in FY2022
The following assets have increased during the year:
• Right-of-use assets (ROU) increased by RM1.6 billion mainly due to additions 
in FY2023 amounting to RM3.2 billion mainly from XL and Robi, coupled with 
foreign exchange translation gains of RM0.5 billion. This was partially offset 
by depreciation expenses during the financial year of RM1.9 billion 
• Assets classified as held for sale of RM0.9 billion in relation to the 
classification of EDOTCO Myanmar as discontinued operations as at  
31 December 2023

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Key Performance Indicators
On 23 February 2023, the Group announced its Headline KPIs guidance for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The Group’s 2023 Headline KPIs announced were as below:
FY2023
Achievement 
FY2023 
Headline KPIs 
FY2023
Achievement
@ Actual currency  @ Constant rate1
Revenue Growth2 8.1% Mid single digit 7.8%
Earnings Before Interest, and Tax (EBIT)3 Growth 17.5% High single digit 18.4%
The Group posted steady operational performance* in FY2023 with revenue and EBITDA growth 
contributed largely by XL in Indonesia, Robi in Bangladesh, and EDOTCO. EBIT however, was 
impacted by loss on disposal and its related impairment of assets of Ncell in Nepal and impairment 
of assets and goodwill of EDOTCO Myanmar and Pakistan. PATAMI was further impacted by capital 
gains tax related receivables write-off in Ncell, cushioned by additional gain on disposal of Celcom 
as a result of final closing adjustment and lower forex losses.
Year on year (FY2023 versus FY2022), XL in Indonesia and Robi in Bangladesh have their 
performance lifted by favourable industry data growth and ARPU uplift. Amidst the improving 
macroeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka, Dialog’s revenue growth remained resilient, whilst profitability 
was boosted by cost rescaling initiatives and forex gains from appreciation of the LKR vs USD. 
Smart in Cambodia continues to deliver steady profits and remain a stable cash generator for the 
Group.
For the Group’s digital businesses, Boost is sustaining its payment ecosystem to support growth 
opportunities for Boost Bank, whilst ADA delivers its fifth year of profitability. EDOTCO continues 
to record strong top line growth, reaping the benefits from its inorganic ventures in Philippines and 
Indonesia, however profitability was impacted by assets and goodwill impairments in Myanmar and 
Pakistan. Link Net continues its transformation to a fibre company, to tap growth opportunities in 
fixed broadband in Indonesia.
Overall, the Group posted revenue ex-device growth of 8.1% and normalised EBIT growth of 17.5% 
in FY2023. Against headline KPIs at constant rate, the Group exceeded its target of mid single digit 
revenue ex-device growth and high single digit EBIT growth, with achievement of 7.8% and 18.4% 
growth respectively.

OUR SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE 
Axiata's share price closed at RM2.38 in FY2023, positioning it as 
the 18th largest company by market capitalisation in FBMKLCI 
at RM21.8 billion. Despite the macroeconomic headwinds and 
exposure to frontier markets, the Group surpassed its headline 
key performance indicators for 2023. This achievement reflects 
the Group's commitment to creating value for stakeholders. 
Share price performance for the first half of 2023 was largely 
impacted by the unfavourable Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) 
ruling on the Ncell capital gains tax issue. Investor sentiment 
was also impacted by concerns on impairments. However, the 
share price remained stable in the second half of the year, 
supported by Mitsui’s investment into ADA, which set a new 
watermark valuation of USD550 million, and affirmation of 
Axiata’s Baa2 ratings with a stable outlook by Moody’s. 
The percentage of shares held by foreign investors remained 
constant at 10.7% at the end of 2023. Axiata FBMKLCI Index

OUR DIVIDEND POLICY 
Following a resilient performance in FY2023, Axiata declared a second interim dividend of 5.0 sen per 
share in February 2024, culminating in a total annual dividend of 10.0 sen per share for the year ending 
on 31 December 2023. This total includes an initial interim dividend of 5.0 sen.
The Board maintains its commitment to the established dividend policy, under which the Company 
aims to distribute dividends amounting to a minimum of at least 30% of its consolidated normalised 
Profit After Tax and Minority Interests (PATAMI), while also seeking to gradually increase the dividend 
payout ratio, taking into account various considerations such as the Group’s future prospects, capital 
requirements and surplus, strategies for growth and expansion, considerations for extraordinary items, 
and other factors deemed pertinent by the Board.
Notes:  ¹ DPS – Dividend per share
 2  DPR – Dividend payout ratio excluding special dividend
 3  The Group announced lower DPR in 2016 and 2017 based on two reasons. First, for prudent reasons, to mitigate against impacts of volatile forex and regulatory risk. Second, for strategic reasons, to enable 4G/data leadership investments as well as for possible  
  mergers and acquisitions (M&A) exercises in the areas of market consolidation. Axiata reverted to DPR of 85% in 2018

language interpretation app DeafT awk, 
enhancing website accessibility, to 
supporting farmers through Govi Mithuru 
eAgri service and championing women’s

ROBI AXIATA REVIEW
Dedicated focus on network quality 
improvement, distribution network revamp, and 
continued momentum in data business helped 
Robi to achieve record earnings. To emphasise 
the scale of our revenue growth, our revenue 
was the highest among all the telecom operators 
in the Asia Pacific region in the second and third 
quarters. 
Driven by subscribers’ confidence in our 
network, Robi had the highest number of new 
subscribers joining its network in the industry. 
Robi’s leadership in digitalisation in the market 
is clear, with the highest proportion of its 
subscriber base being 4G and data users. 
Our zero-based costing initiatives also helped 
to drive profitability. We are expanding beyond 
connectivity services by adopting various 
innovative digital customer engagement models. 
We have created two new subsidiaries, AxEnT ec 
PLC to cater to the B2B segment and r ventures 
PLC to generate fresh momentum in our journey 
for digitalisation.
Robi’s net-zero journey gathered pace with focus 
placed on ensuring an energy efficient network 
that adopts all measures of efficiency, including 
embracing renewable energy. We also launched 
projects such as Haate Kolome, providing 
vocational education through digital platforms. 
Robi is powering ahead with sustainability at the 
core of its operating model.

Our mobile network business success has paved 
the way for new ventures in FBB and advanced 
ICT solutions, meeting the latest market 
demands. We partnered with several wholesale 
infrastructure providers to deliver FBB. We also 
focused on enhancing digital operations and 
expanding our network to surpass customer 
expectations and regulatory standards.
Despite facing a challenging operating 
environment and intense competition, Smart 
emerged as a frontrunner by introducing 
‘Smart for Business’, a suite of comprehensive 
business solutions designed specifically for 
SMEs. Understanding the key role these 
enterprises play in our economy, we launched 
this service to support their operational success 
with cost-effective, yet powerful solutions.  
Our strategic focus has been dedicated to 
both broadening our services and bolstering 
our financial strength. We reviewed the main 
drivers of expenses and identified key areas 
for improvement. As a result, we deployed 
green energy for our utilities, implemented 
a more efficient distribution system, and 
optimised procurement costs. This careful and 
strategic management has greatly enhanced 
our operational efficiency, positioning us on a 
trajectory of enduring success.
In 2024, we plan to build on our FBB and 
ICT solutions success. Our strategy involves 
expanding our skills, partnering with top 
infrastructure providers, and offering more

EDOTCO GROUP REVIEW
Reflecting on the dynamic landscape of 2023, characterised by 
turbulent macroeconomic conditions including currency volatility 
and escalating interest rates, our organisation not only navigated 
these challenges but emerged with newfound resilience and 
vigour. In the face of adversity, we stood firm in our dedication to 
strategic foresight and proactive financial stewardship, laying the 
groundwork for our remarkable success. These core principles 
guided us through the uncertainties, allowing us to adapt swiftly 
to the changing economic conditions and capitalise on new 
opportunities.
Our achievements amid this challenging backdrop are the result of 
a strategic approach shaped by innovative thinking and foresight. 
We implemented pioneering solutions to maintain optimal 
operational efficiency, such as deploying solar technologies 
to counter escalating fuel costs and constructing agile, space-
optimised infrastructure. Furthermore, we strengthened our 
financial stability by mitigating currency risks through fixed 
exchange rate mechanisms, fostering not only predictability in 
our fiscal planning but also bolstering confidence among our 
stakeholders.
Our success extends through our meticulous approach to 
strategic negotiations in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) 
endeavours, ensuring not only the optimisation of our portfolio 
but also the seamless integration of assets and the refinement of 
co-location opportunities. These initiatives have proven pivotal 
in our ability to navigate economic headwinds and emerge even 
stronger on the other side.
Looking ahead, our commitment remains steadfast to 
supporting governmental initiatives in all the nations where 
we are present, aimed at fostering an inclusive digital nation 
by bridging connectivity gaps and shaping the future of the 
digital infrastructure landscape. These endeavours are deeply 
aligned with our overarching mission of accelerating equitable 
connectivity for our customers and creating value for our 
shareholders.

within twelve (12) months from date of sale 
and purchase agreement. Accordingly, the 
Myanmar business results and cash flows have 
been presented as discontinuing operations in 
the Group financial statements, and as below: 
• Revenue growth of 13.8% due to organic 
growth in its build-to-suits and co-location 
expansion in Bangladesh and Malaysia, and 
inorganically from the completed acquisition 
of 2,710 sites in the Philippines as of 2023, 
while Project JENDELA contributed to an 
increase in Other revenue
• EBITDA grew by 14.4% YoY from higher 
revenue flow and cost optimisation, especially 
in net energy costs offset against one-off  
provisions for staff benefits and higher site-
related maintenance costs in the Philippines 
from inorganic exercise and corresponding 
costs from Project JENDELA 
• EBIT grew marginally, attributed to 
EBITDA contribution offset against higher 
depreciation and amortisation from the 
Philippines
• PATAMI recorded loss of RM936 million, 
impacted by higher net finance cost, net

Portfolio Optimisation & Value Illumination, New

on the Group, with all NTCs continuing with a

development, including adopting effective cost 
management

to monetise their tower assets, potentially 
introducing new competitors into our core

• MNO consolidation could result in consolidation 
of telco sites and reduced tenancies for

BOOST REVIEW
Boost had a breakthrough year in 2023, successfully 
executing our strategic vision of becoming a regional 
full-spectrum fintech brand with a digital banking focus.  
A standout achievement was preparing for the digital bank’s 
operational readiness review required by Bank Negara 
Malaysia (BNM) with our consortium partner RHB Banking 
Group. The crown jewel of our progress resulted in Boost 
Bank by Axiata and RHB (Boost Bank) becoming the first 
homegrown digital bank to secure regulatory approval to 
commence operations in January 2024, months ahead of 
schedule. For this, I am immensely proud of our team. 
Throughout the year, we fostered deeper relationships 
across the entire Boost ecosystem and our partners. 
A notable highlight was launching the Beyond Card, 
leveraging synergies between Boost’s fintech expertise,  
CelcomDigi’s wealth of data, and Mastercard’s extensive 
network to introduce Malaysia’s first global prepaid card with 
a Shariah-compliant PayLater feature.
 
We applied similar approaches within the broader Axiata 
footprint, expanding our presence into Cambodia through a 
partnership with Smart Axiata, AMK MFI and Mora, to offer 
consumer-device financing. Boost Credit’s continued growth 
in Malaysia and Indonesia further solidified our regional 
footprint, disbursing over RM4 billion in financing to date. Our 
collaboration with EasyEat drove digital transformation by 
offering merchant solutions to Southeast Asian F&B MSMEs 
through Boost Connect’s payment gateway services. 
These initiatives underscore Boost as a formidable 
homegrown fintech powerhouse, extending Malaysia’s 
success story across Southeast Asia and contributing to 
financial inclusion in the region.

valuation of USD550 million following 
Mitsui’s investment.

were recognised with a record-
breaking 93 industry awards,

• EBITDA rose 104.3% YoY to RM6.2 billion with merger being the main factor of the 
growth. The cost of sales, network and IT-related expenses also increased due to the 
larger network and higher data service demand. However, some of these costs were 
offset by cost optimisation initiatives and one-off credit
• PAT rose 84.8% because of the merger effect, partly balanced by higher depreciation 
costs from full year effect of the change in useful life of mobile network assets and

A Solid First-year as a Merged Company
In its first full year of operations, CelcomDigi delivered a strong 
financial, operational and integration performance, in line with 
its 2023 strategy and guidance. This performance strengthened 
its market leadership with growth across all business areas and 
a stronger subscriber base, achieved through focused market 
execution and disciplined cost management. The company was also 
on track with its first-year integration and synergy targets, enabling 
it to realise gross synergy of over RM300 million in FY2023. 
In 2023, CelcomDigi began an extensive network integration 
and modernisation exercise to build Malaysia’s most advanced 
and widest digital network with the latest 4G LTE and 5G-ready 
technologies. As of December 2023, it successfully integrated 
over 5,600 sites across the country, uplifting the overall network 
experience for its customers in post-consolidation areas. Its 4G LTE 
and 4G LTE-A network coverage grew to 97% and 91% of populated 
areas nationwide, respectively. 
CelcomDigi unveiled a new brand, which signalled its commitment 
to become an institution that inspires the digital lives of all 
Malaysians. 
Outlook for 2024 and Beyond
Entering 2024 with good growth momentum, CelcomDigi’s 
strategy to strengthen its market leadership is outlined by three 
key priorities. 
Firstly, focus will be placed on strengthening its core and new 
growth areas through delivering superior customer experience 
with 5G and converged services. The company will continue to 
harness the potential of emerging technologies to build capacity 
and solutions, enabling it to empower enterprise transformation, 
as well as invest in partnerships with global technology giants to 
bring innovation for customers, develop a thriving local digital 
ecosystem, and support the nation’s digital aspirations. 
Secondly, CelcomDigi is set to deliver synergies and 
scale efficiency by accelerating integration activities and 
institutionalising operational excellence to realise RM8 billion 
worth of synergies in net present value. This is key to enabling 
the company to further invest in digitalisation and innovation. 
Thirdly, CelcomDigi is committed to delivering consistent 
shareholder returns, backed by synergies and a strong balance 
sheet. 
Focused execution of these priorities is crucial in ensuring 
CelcomDigi continues to achieve growth and profitability amid 
a challenging market environment. It also sets the company on 
the right course to realise the full benefits envisioned from the 
merger. 
CelcomDigi will continue to pursue new benchmarks to deliver on 
its purpose of Advancing and Inspiring Society in a sustainable 
and responsible manner. With a robust ESG strategy established, 
the company will ensure that it delivers impact by enabling 
inclusive and safe digital access, maintaining a sustainable value 
chain, implementing good governance and performance culture, 
and managing its environmental impact. The company’s pursuit 
of leadership in ESG best practices and its focus on national 
innovation aim to position CelcomDigi as a brand that Malaysians 
can trust and rely on in the age of ‘digital-everything’.

Overview 82Axiata Group Berhad • IAR 2023
COMMITTED TO ACCOUNTABILITY
The Board of Directors of Axiata Group Berhad 
(Board or BOD) strongly advocate and support 
the principles of good corporate governance. 
The Board has continually strived to enhance and 
strengthen the Group’s governance system and 
processes to ensure that the highest levels of 
corporate governance is practised Group-wide.
This Corporate Governance Overview Statement 
(CG Overview Statement) presents key governance 
highlights for the financial year 2023 and up to the 
date of publication of this IAR, outlining how Axiata 
complies with the three principles and the practices 
and step ups of the Malaysian Code on Corporate 
Governance 2021 (MCCG 2021) during the year under 
review. 
This statement has been made in accordance with 
the authority of the Board dated 21 March 2024 and 
finalised and updated until the date of the publication 
of the Integrated Annual Report (IAR) 2023 with 
delegated authority to the Board Sustainability 
Committee*.
This statement is complemented with a Corporate 
Governance Report (CG Report) based on a 
prescribed format pursuant to paragraph 15.25 of the 
Main Market Listing Requirements (Main LR) of Bursa 
Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa Securities). The CG 
Report is available on the Company’s website under 
the Corporate Governance section as well as via an 
announcement on Bursa Securities. This statement 
should also be read in conjunction with the Statement 
on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) 
and the Board Audit Committee (BAC) Report as 
well as other information in the Governance and 
Audited Financial Statements 2023 (GAFS) and the 
Sustainability and National Contribution Report (SNCR) 
accompanying this IAR.
Throughout the financial year ended 31 December 
2023 and continuing until the date of this IAR 2023, 
the Company has complied with the provisions 
of the MCCG 2021 save for Practices 5.9 and 8.2 
respectively relating to the requirement to have at 
least 30% women directors and senior management 
remuneration as well as Practice 9.4 which is the Step 
Up on the requirement to have all Independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Board Audit Committee. A 
more thorough description of the manner in which the 
Company is addressing these departures is set out in 
the CG Report.
The Board is committed to maintaining the highest 
standards of good governance to promote quality 
decision making and the execution of those decisions 
within a disciplined framework of policies and 
procedures.
Good governance exists in an environment where 
roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, forums 
are conducive for a robust debate and performance 
is regularly reviewed. We outline our progress and 
describe our governance efforts over the next few 
pages. The Board provides effective leadership to the 
Group and embraces the principles of ethical leadership 
in setting and implementing the Group’s strategy.
To ensure we make and execute good decisions and 
direction in the interest of the Group, its shareholders 
and other stakeholders, the Board works continuously 
to maintain and develop its governance framework. 
The Board exercises independent judgement on all 
issues reserved for the Board’s review and approval, 
while simultaneously considering the needs of all 
stakeholders, and take full responsibility for the 
management, direction and performance of the Group.
HOW OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES 
CONTRIBUTE TO VALUE CREATION
Good corporate governance contributes to value 
creation by ensuring accountability through reporting 
and disclosure, effective risk management, clear 
performance management, transparency and ethical 
and effective leadership. In addition, the diversity 
of our directors in terms of gender, race, nationality 
and professional background (refer pages 84 and 89) 
facilitates an environment for constructive dialogue 
and enables the Board to consider the needs of a wide 
range of stakeholder interests.
The Board believes these qualities of governance, 
which are aligned with the principles of the MCCG 2021, 
enable the Group to create value for stakeholders in a 
sustainable manner over the short, medium and long 
term as described in the strategy section of this IAR.
CHANGES IN OUR GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
In efforts to refine attention on investment activities 
within the Group, the Board had expanded the scope 
of the previously named Axiata Enterprise Investment 
Board Committee (AEIB) to encompass a broader 
range of investment activities. The AEIB was renamed 
as the Axiata Board Investment Committee (ABIC) 
effective 28 August 2023 and further mandated in 
line with the committee’s broader scope. At the same 
time, similar committees have been rolled out at PT XL 
Axiata Tbk, PT Link Net Tbk, Robi Axiata Limited, Dialog 
Axiata PLC and Smart Axiata Co., Ltd. emulating the 
same function as ABIC. The duties and responsibilities 
of ABIC are to evaluate, discuss, and recommend to 
the Board, for approval/ratification, proposals from 
Management pertaining to budget allocations, returns 
expectations and/or funding requirements in line with 
the scope outlined in its TOR and in accordance to the 
approval limits set out in the Limits of Authority (LoA) 
Policy and/or the Financial Policies & Procedures of 
the Company.
Since the inaugural issue of our annual report in 
an integrated manner, in the IAR 2017 issued in 
2018, matters relating to Environment, Social and 
Governance (ESG) remain a core focus of Axiata 
and command significant attention. In keeping with 
the growing importance of ESG, we welcome the 
introduction of various ESG recommended practices 
in MCCG 2021 as well as the Listing Requirements by 
OUR GOVERNANCE PRACTICES
Leadership
The Company is headed by an effective Board 
of Directors, whose roles and responsibilities are 
all clearly defined. The roles of Chairman and 
the GCEO are held by separate individuals. The 
Chairman takes responsibility for leading the 
Board, whilst day-to-day management of the 
Group is delegated to the GCEO.
IAR, details on the Board of Directors and the Board’s 
role and activities on pages 84,88 and 91
Effectiveness
The Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee 
oversees many of the activities which together, 
underpin the effectiveness of the Board. It takes the 
lead on succession planning, taking account of the size 
and structure of the Board, evaluates the balance of 
skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the 
Company on the Board, and reviews outputs from the 
annual effectiveness evaluation of the Board.
IAR, details on the Board Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee activities on page 96
Accountability
The Board Audit Committee assists the Board in 
fulfilling its statutory and fiduciary responsibilities 
by reviewing the financial statements and financial 
reporting process, the audit process, the adequacy 
and effectiveness of systems for internal controls, 
risk management and governance, and the process 
for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations.
IAR, details on the Board Audit Committee activities on 
pages 94 to 95
Relations with Shareholders 
An open dialogue is maintained with shareholders 
regarding strategic, governance and other 
objectives. This is led by the GCEO and the GCFO, 
whilst the Chairman and other Non-Executive 
Directors also engage with shareholders as 
necessary. The views and concerns of shareholders, 
as well as engagement with them more generally, is 
considered by the whole Board.
IAR, details on our stakeholder relationships on  
pages 101 to 102
introducing key performance indicators (KPIs) on ESG 
matters for the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) 
and OpCo CEOs as well as designating the Group Chief 
Corporate Officer as the senior management member in 
charge of ESG matters.
The Board also plans for at least a twice-yearly tabling 
of ESG matters at Board meetings.
Following the introduction of a Fit & Proper Policy 
for Axiata (F&P Policy) in July 2022 that require 
assessments of fitness and probity of individuals 
nominated as directors and senior management of 
the Group before their appointment and employment 
as the case may be, the BNRC has monitored the 
implementation of the F&P Policy. The F&P Policy meets 
and exceeds the provisions of the Listing Requirements 
in its scope of application. Since its implementation, a 
number of appointments to the Axiata Board have had 
an assessment of fitness and probity conducted prior to 
the appointments and the policy has also been applied 
on the re-election of directors who are standing for re-
election following mandatory rotational retirement.
Bursa Malaysia issued amendments to the Listing 
Requirements in the middle of 2023  which amongst 
others expanded the scope and remit of Audit 
Committees to review conflict of interest (COI) situations 
that arise or persist, and the measures taken to resolve, 
eliminate, or mitigate the COI. The said amendments 
also require the disclosure in the BAC Report of a 
summary of the COI reviewed and the measures taken 
to resolve, eliminate, or mitigate such conflicts. 
Following the introduction of these amendments, 
the Board Audit Committee had, in November 2023, 
constructed and adopted a COI Reporting Framework 
to identify and report on COIs that arises within the 
Axiata Group. The reports arising from the same will 
assist in the preparation of the BAC Report that will 
identify measures on the resolution, elimination, or 
mitigation of such COIs.

AN EXPERIENCED LEADERSHIP
In January 2023, Ziad Shatara was appointed as the CEO of Smart. Prior to Ziad’s appointment, a 
transitionary leadership at Smart was established in late 2021, where Feiruz Ikhwan, CFO of Smart 
assumed the role of Acting CEO. This followed Thomas Hundt, the previous CEO of Smart, assuming 
the role of Group Chief Strategy & Technology Officer of Axiata.
In the interim period since November 2023, Kanishka Gayan Wickrama, the CFO of Link Net was 
appointed as Acting CEO, upon the departure of the previous President Director & CEO of Link Net. 
During this period, Kanishka Gayan Wickrama continued to retain his role as CFO, which ensures a 
smooth transition and continuity of the business.
These appointments demonstrate orderly succession planning undertaken in accordance with the 
Axiata Talent Management Framework. The succession plans are presented to the Board twice a year. 
The plans include talent (both internal and identified external talent) ready to take on senior roles 
within different time frames and the intervention required for key talent.
The succession planning process provides Axiata a ready pool of talent to plan ahead with and when 
there is insufficient bench strength, to scout the market and identify promising candidates in advance 
of the anticipated demand.

Board Roles and Their Responsibilities
Appointment of Directors
There is a clear and transparent process for the selection, 
nomination and appointment of suitable candidates to the Board 
of Axiata and achieving board balance through diversity in skill 
set, experience, age, nationality, and gender. This principle is 
encapsulated in the Axiata Board Composition Framework. Based 
on this framework, both merit and diversity are factors considered 
hand in hand when selecting board members.
The formal process involves the Board Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee (BNRC) first identifying the gap in Board 
composition before sourcing for candidates. Subsequently, the 
BNRC evaluates and recommends to the Board suitable candidates 
who fulfil the requirements. Other criteria such as integrity, existing 
commitments, potential risks and/or conflicts of interest and ability 
to bring a different perspective and increase diversity of the Board 
are also considered in the BNRC’s review. The process for Board 
appointment also mandates the BNRC and Group Chief Executive 
Officer and Managing Director to engage external consultants and 
this has been utilised on many occasions.
On 25 May 2022, the Board approved a Fit & Proper Policy to be 
effective from 1 July 2022, where the proposed candidates to 
be appointed to the Board or reappointments of directors to the 
Board are assessed to determine fitness and probity. This is also in 
keeping with the amendments to the Listing Requirements made 
by Bursa Securities as communicated to all listed issuers by Bursa 
Securities.
The Fit & Proper Policy is available online. Please visit

EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY INTO OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES 
Axiata has strengthened its sustainability 
governance by enhancing alignment with 
OpCos, ensuring effective implementation of 
sustainability strategies and initiatives.
Axiata’s Board holds ultimate responsibility over 
the Group’s sustainability agenda and provides 
oversight of the integration of ESG matters 
in Axiata’s corporate strategy with the aim of 
balancing stakeholder interests while ensuring 
that we grow responsibly and create long-term 
value. 
To keep the Board up-to-date and ensure 
that they understand the sustainability issues 
relevant to the Group, the Board receives regular 
Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) Reports 
from the BSC Chairman. Additionally, the Board 
schedules a minimum of two sustainability 
updates in a year, during which issues relating 
to the matter are presented, deliberated and 
resolved in an appropriate manner. 
The BSC provides oversight and strategic 
guidance to the Group and resolve matters 
relating to sustainability management as a 
Group-wide agenda. BSC also has oversight of 
climate-related matters, including climate risks 
and opportunities.
The BSC also has the authority to appoint 
external counsels or advisers and obtain 
independent professional advice or services 
in managing sustainability practices. The BSC 
reviews and evaluates its performance at least 
once a year to ensure that it has carried out its 
responsibilities. In the year under review, the 
BSC met 10 times.
GCEO and Managing Director is responsible for 
overall management on sustainability-related 
matters. The GCEO is supported by the Group 
Chief Corporate Officer, who oversees Group 
Sustainability, and other senior management 
members within their areas of responsibility.
For accountability, sustainability-related 
key performance indicators (KPIs) including 
climate change performance linked to net-zero 
commitment are included in our GCEO as well 
as OpCo Senior Leadership Teams’ (SLT) annual 
remuneration-linked KPIs. All OpCo CEOs are 
also authorised to sign-off on sustainability-
related governance as part of internal control 
assurance.
Chaired by the Group Chief Corporate Officer, 
the Axiata Sustainability Steering Committee 
(Steering Committee) consists of representatives 
from Group Sustainability, OpCo Sustainability 
teams and representatives, and selected 
Heads or nominees from key Group corporate 
functions. The Steering Committee is responsible 
for supporting the management of ESG matters 
and ensures collaboration to streamline the 
approach within the Group to achieve Axiata’s 
sustainability agenda and promote sharing. 
Group Sustainability leads the development 
of overall strategy and framework to drive 
sustainability initiatives and programmes across 
the Group in a structured and cohesive way. 
Their responsibilities include monitoring and 
managing business sustainability practices and 
targets, keeping abreast of the sustainability 
development landscape and ensuring 
management of the Group’s ESG risk and 
opportunities are assessed and evaluated. 
The team also provides advisory support and 
capacity building for the sustainability teams in 
all OpCos and receives sustainability progress 
updates. 
On all OpCo Boards and Board Committees, 
Axiata is represented by its Directors or Senior 
Leadership representatives. This enables 
alignment and oversight from the Group to 
OpCos, including ensuring the integration of 
sustainability across the organisation. 
Each OpCo has its own sustainability governance, 
where sustainability-related matters are elevated 
to OpCo Board, Board Committee, CEO or 
Management Committees by Sustainability 
Teams or representatives. For FY2023, a key 
priority was to promote accountability and 
ensure strategic alignment throughout the 
OpCos by leveraging on the BRCC of each 
OpCo. With guidance and support from OpCo 
BRCCs, the BSC was able to support the Group’s 
and OpCo’s sustainability agenda including 
compliance with ESG-related regulatory 
requirements. OpCos are responsible for the 
governance, daily management and operations, 
programme implementation and data collection 
for the Group’s identified sustainability material 
matters, as well as their own sustainability 
matters or practices.

BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS
BOARD FOCUS AREAS
Monitoring of the Company’s performance and business 
planning for the year remain a priority for the Board’s 
deliberation despite a considerable amount of time and 
attention being devoted to strategic matters and mergers 
and acquisitions (M&A).
The Board also considered new opportunities and new ways 
of engagement to leverage on the wide range of talent, 
skill and expertise available within the Group. Efforts were 
also expanded in assessing the various options available in 
unearthing and increasing value to and within the Group.
BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2023
• The Board allocated approximately 35.30% of its time in 
2023 during Board meetings focusing on risk, audit and 
compliance matters.
• At the Board Retreat held in July and November 2023, 
the Board focused on deliberating on Axiata’s strategic 
direction across its businesses and footprint, taking into 
account the state of the telecommunications industry 
and the direction that the industry is heading to, as well 
as considering Telco-TechCo for fintech and digital telco 
businesses and strategic options and way forward for 
Axiata. 
2024 FOCUS
The focus for 2024 is continuing Axiata’s transformative 
journey with clear targets to enhance our performance, 
accelerate value creation, and increase long-term 
shareholder value. Axiata will focus on our portfolio and 
business strategy guided by the 5 vectors of value creation 
and 5 strategic priorities which will steer us on our journey 
towards becoming the Next Generation Digital Champion, 
aligned with an aspiration to be recognised as a Sustainable 
Dividend Company to ensure consistent returns to 
shareholders.
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS (CODE)
The Code is in line with the practices in the Malaysian Code 
on Corporate Governance 2021 as well as the provisions of 
the Securities Commission Guidelines on the Conduct of 
Directors of Public Listed Companies issued in July 2020. All 
of the OpCos adopt a code of conduct similar if not identical, 
to that of Axiata leading to a shaping of a common ethical 
culture within the Group. The provisions of the Code are also 
embedded within the Employees Code of Conduct and our 
core values of Uncompromising Integrity and Exceptional 
Performance applicable across the Group.
AXIATA ADVISORY PANEL
The Axiata Advisory Panel (AAP) advises the Board on 
matters relating to the business of the Group across its 
geographical footprint and other areas and location that the 
Group intends to venture. The AAP comprises members with 
extensive and established knowledge and experience of the 
business and industry environment that Axiata is involved in. 
The members of the AAP are Tan Sri Jamaludin Ibrahim and 
Gita Irawan Wirjawan, being inaugural members from the 
establishment of the AAP in 2021. 
The Board had, at the Board Meeting [No. 1-24] held on 30 
January 2024 resolved that the AAP be dissolved effective 
from the expiration of the tenure of the current members 
i.e. February 2024 as the purpose and goal of its formation 
have been achieved. 
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS EVALUATION
The Board engaged the services of a corporate governance 
advisory firm (Consultant) to assist with the 2023 Board 
Effectiveness Evaluation (BEE) of the Board’s performance.

On 6 June 2023 Bursa Malaysia issued a letter informing listed companies 
of an amendment to the Listing Requirements in relation to sustainability 
training for directors. All Directors of listed companies are required to 
attend and complete the Mandatory Accreditation Programme (MAP). 
With the increasing emphasis and importance on matters of sustainability, 
the MAP is now broken into two parts, with Part I comprising the current 
contents, and a new Part II compromising matters of sustainability. The 
new provisions of the Listing Requirements require existing directors of 
listed companies to attend and complete this new Part II by 1 August 2025. 
All Directors of Axiata have attended the MAP Part I.
The Group Company Secretarial Division works with the Institute of 
Corporate Directors Malaysia (ICDM) to update the available training dates 
from time to time. As at to date seven Directors have attended the MAP 
Part II.
REMUNERATING FAIRL Y 
Non-Executive Directors (NED)
As a regional company, the remuneration philosophy is to develop 
a remuneration structure that commensurates with the Directors’ 
responsibilities at both Board and Board Committee levels and is sufficient 
to attract, incentivise and retain quality Directors. The remuneration 
packages differentiate the Chairman and ordinary members of the Board 
and Board Committees to reflect the larger role and responsibilities of the 
Chairman.
At the end of 2021, a review of the NEDs’ remuneration structure 
was conducted by a consultant (Consultant) and the analysis and 
recommendation of the Consultant was tabled to the Board of Axiata in 
February 2022. From the benchmarking analysis of Axiata against similarly 
sized Malaysian regional-based international telecommunication peers, 
the recommendation was to increase the Chairman’s monthly fees to 
align with the median and to align Board Committee ratios to P50 of that 
of similar-sized Malaysian companies in Malaysia. The BNRC and Board 
recommended for the increase in monthly fees for the Board Committees 
and to align the BRCC meeting allowances with that of the BAC, which 
was subsequently approved by the shareholders at the 30th AGM held in 
May 2022.
In line with the above proposal, the Board also approved the enhancement 
of the Board Annual Report Committee (BARC) by adding an additional 
scope to the committee to oversee the sustainability practices within 
Axiata Group i.e. to oversee Axiata’s sustainability or interchangeably, 
ESG (which includes climate-related risks and opportunities) related 
framework, strategy, external commitments, policies and practices as 
well as performances against such matters including any external ESG 
ratings or assessments. The BARC was renamed as Board Sustainability 
Committee (BSC) on 8 April 2022 and the new rate of monthly fees and 
meeting allowance was also proposed for BSC.
The following table outlines the remuneration structure for NEDs of the Group in 2023.

Non-Resident NEDs, equipment, telecommunication facilities, 
insurance and medical.
At the 29th and 30th AGMs of the Company, the shareholders 
approved the extension of Travel Allowance for Non-Resident 
NEDs for their attendance at Board and Board Committee 
meetings virtually. The extended Travel Allowance was intended 
to be paid to the Non-Resident NEDs until the restrictions 
imposed on global travel are fully uplifted and travel may be 
safely undertaken thereafter. Following from the easing of 
COVID-19 travel restrictions from the second half of 2022, the 
extension of travel allowance for virtually attended meetings 
have tapered following an increase in physical attendance from 
the easing of travel restrictions. Accordingly, Axiata has now 
ceased this extension to Travel Allowance.
Executive Directors (EDs) 
The Company’s policy on remuneration for the EDs is formulated 
to ensure competitiveness with market to attract, retain and 
motivate an ED of the highest calibre to competently manage 
the Company.
The remuneration is therefore structured to link various 
components of the package with corporate and individual 
performance. It also takes into account total compensation 
of comparable companies (of similar size and complexity to 
Axiata locally; and in the same industry in the region), based on 
benchmarking conducted by independent consultants.
The current remuneration framework of the EDs consists 
of basic salary, benefits-in-kind and Employees Provident 
Fund (EPF) contributions (applicable to local ED only), as the 
guaranteed components. On top of this, the EDs are eligible 
for two types of performance-based incentives which are the 
Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) linked to a particular financial 
year’s targets and the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which is 
linked to a 3-year long-term target.
For the STIP, the performance of the EDs is measured based 
on the achievement of the annual KPIs. These KPIs comprise 
not only quantitative targets, such as annual revenue, EBITDA, 
PATAMI Operating Free Cash Flow (OFCF) and relative 
performance of the OpCos, but also qualitative targets which 
include strategic milestones and initiatives that need to be 
achieved and implemented in a given year, on areas such as 
strategy, innovation, business development, synergy, human 
capital management, financial management and societal 
development. The weightage of the qualitative and quantitative 
targets may be adjusted to accommodate the Group’s 
aspirations.
For the LTIP, the performance of the EDs is measured on the 
achievement of a combination of relative Total Shareholders 
Return, PATAMI Margin and OFCF Margin within the vesting 
period.
