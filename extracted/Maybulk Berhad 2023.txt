overview
In FY2023, the Group undertook a series of activities to right-size its shipping bulker business, diversify into shelving and storage 
solution business, diversify into industrial property business. These steps enable the Group to reduce its dependency on shipping 
bulker business and diversify its earning streams.
During the year, the Group also reorganised its equity structure via capital reduction exercise. Consequently, the share capital of the 
Group was reduced by RM275.0 million with corresponding entries booked in the retained earnings account. 
In addition, the Group reviewed its accounting treatment in relation to the recognition of translation gains when translating financial 
statements denominated in United States Dollars (“USD”). As a results, part of translation gains recognised in the previous financial 
years as foreign currency translation reserves were transferred to retained earnings as prior year adjustments.

Investment holding & Others Business (Cont’d)
This segment incurred unrealised foreign exchange losses of RM11.990 million (FY 2022: unrealised foreign exchange gain 
of RM 4.820 million) mainly arising from the translation of Ringgit denominated cash balances to USD which is the functional 
currency of the Group following the weakening of Ringgit against USD. This was partially offset by realised foreign exchange 
gain of RM 5.084 million (FY 2022: realised foreign exchange loss of RM 5.867 million) arising from the actual conversion of 
USD cash balances to MYR for daily operation.
Other operating income mainly arising from interest income of RM 6.061 million (FY 2022: RM4.588 million) generated from 
interest bearing current account and fixed deposits.
The FY 2023 result included gains on liquidation of subsidiaries arising from the transfer of cumulative foreign exchange differences 
relating to these entities from equity to profit or loss upon liquidation. 
The segment reported a profit before tax of RM0.838 million in FY 2023, an improvement of RM2.813 million compared to a 
loss before tax of RM1.975 million in FY2022. 
cashFlows and Borrowings
The Group continues to manage its liquidity prudently, with a positive net cash inflow of RM9.059 million generated from its 
operating activities as well as net cash inflow of RM77.991 million generated from its investing activities mainly from proceeds 
from disposal of a vessel. 
The Group had paid up a total of RM115.0 million as dividend to its shareholders during the year, and invested a net cash of 
RM63.433 million on EMTS.
The cash and cash equivalents at end FY2023 were RM311.206 million of which RM165.549 million were placed in short-term 
deposits and investments to earn interest and dividend income. 
equity
Total equity as at 31 December 2023 stood at RM522.308 million from RM487.052 million in FY2022. The increase in total 
equity was mainly attributable to profit earned in FY2023. This was offset by dividend declared.
The net assets per share as at 31 December 2023 amounted to RM0.52.
During the year, the Group also reorganised its equity structure via capital reduction exercise which was approved by the 
shareholders on 15 June 2023 and the relevant authorities on 18 August 2023. Consequently, the share capital of the Group 
was reduced by RM275.0 million with corresponding credit booked in the retained earnings account.

financial statements denominated in USD. As a result, foreign currency exchange reserves attributable to cash utilised to pay 
dividend in previous financial years were identified and reversed from foreign currency reserve accounts into retained earnings.

Key operations and Financial risKs
The Group is exposed to a wide range of operation and financial risk. The management is aware of the key business risks and 
is constantly monitoring these risks whilst implementing risk mitigating strategies to manage these risks. 
Customer concentration risks
For Shipping Bulkers Segment, the Group has entered into a long-term contract with its key customer which has effectively 
locked-in the charter rate for its only vessel, thus there will be only 1 customer for this segment.
For Shelving and Storage Solutions Segment, there are two customers who contributed more than 10% of sales generated 
by this division.
The Group strives to expand the customer base to manage customer concentration risk in this segment.
Supplier concentration risks
For Shelving and Storage Solutions Segment, more than 90% of total purchase was supplied by two suppliers from the same 
group of companies.
The Group strives to expand the supplier base to manage supplier concentration risk in this segment.

Key OPeRatIOnS anD FInanCIal RISKS (COnt’D)
Credit risks
For Shipping Bulkers segment, the payment term for our 
customer is due 30 days after the loading of cargo.
For Shelving and Storage Solutions Segment, it is an industrial 
norm to sell the products on credit terms. Usually credit terms 
of between 14 days to 90 days are granted to the customers, 
subject to a credit evaluation process.
As at FY2023, the Group has high concentration of credit risk 
in the form of outstanding balances due from 2 customers, 
representing 49% of the Group’s trade receivables.
The management reviews the credit terms and limit granted 
to each customer annually and ageing reports are reviewed 
monthly to identify potential slow paying customers so that 
appropriate actions can be taken to recover those debts.
Evaluation on expected credit loss is made at each financial 
year end to ensure adequate allowance has been made for 
potential doubtful debts. 
Regulatory risks
The vessels operated by the Group ply international waters and 
would need to comply with global maritime regulations as well 
as the regional maritime regulations applicable to the route the 
vessels take. In this respect, the Group outsourced the ship 
operations to an experienced service provider. 
The Group also avoid plying the international routes where 
there are geopolitical tensions.
For export sales of Shelving and Storage Solutions Segment, 
the Group would need to comply with the local authority’s 
regulations of the country of its foreign customers.
Environmental and sustainability risks
We have integrated sustainability as our core strategies in 
order to comply with the recommendations set out by the 
International Maritime Organisation (“IMO”). Our fuel-efficient 
green vessels are environmentally friendly.
Cyber risks
The evolution of cybercrime and cyber-threats due to the 
acceleration in digital technologies and infrastructure pose a 
great challenge to the Group’s information system. 
The Group take accountability to manage the growing threat 
of cyber-attacks including protecting data related to our 
stakeholders and business information. The following measures 
have been taken:
• Installation of Firewall, Anti-Spam and Antivirus applications

Fluctuations in charter rates
The charter rates for dry bulk business is dependent upon the 
demand and supply of commodity items such as coal, grains, 
iron ore and other commodity and the supply of shipping 
capacity in the global market. 
With the disposal of Alam Kekal during the year, the Group has 
eliminated this risk.
The Group has previously entered into long term Contract 
of Affreightment with fixed freight rate for Alam Kuasa, the 
remaining vessel in the Group. 
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate
The functional currency of the Company and certain key 
subsidiaries is USD whilst the reporting currency is RM. The 
fluctuations in USD versus RM will have an impact on the value 
of net assets reported periodically by the Group.

Interest rate risks
The Group placed significant amount of its cash and cash 
equivalent in short term money market deposit. The rate of 
return from deposit placement is dependent on the interest rate 
offered by the financial institution in Malaysia and Singapore.
With the Group’s venturing into industrial property business, 
the Group may incur borrowings in the future to finance 
the purchase of land and construction of warehouses. The 
Group may be exposed to interest rate risks, in the event the 
borrowings obtained is subject to floating interest rate.
Joint Venture and Investment risks
The Group entered into a SSA with GVV and a SPA with 
KLSB to acquire a piece of freehold industrial land in Mukim 
of Kapar, Daerah Klang, Selangor. The Group intends to enter 
into industrial property business upon completion of the SSA 
and the SPA.
The Group has also secured banking facility to finance the 
development on the freehold industrial land.
Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that the joint venture and 
investment will generate adequate returns to the Group. 
corporate exercises
The Group undertook the following corporate exercises during the year:
(a) Capital Reduction
 On 16 May 2023, the Company proposed to undertake a reduction of the issued share capital of the Company pursuant 
to Section 116 of the Companies Act 2016  (“Capital Reduction”). The Capital Reduction exercise was carried out after 
the Company had received approval from shareholders, sanction from the Court and confirmation by Suruhanjaya Syarikat 
Malaysia. Consequently, the share capital of the Company was reduced from RM338,791,327.42 to RM63,791,327.42 
comprising 1,000,000,000 shares.
 The Capital Reduction entails the cancellation of the issued share capital amounted to RM275.0 million which is lost or 
unrepresented by available assets.
 The credit arising from the Capital Reduction was set off against the accumulated losses of the Company while the 
balance, was credited to the retained earnings of the Company.
(b) On 20 June 2023, the Company proposed to obtain shareholders’ mandate for the disposal of Alam Kekal, a bulk carrier, 
owned by Kekal Shipping Pte Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to a non-related third party to 
be identified for a disposal consideration to be determined and satisfied entirely in cash.
 Upon securing shareholders’ approval, the Company entered into a memorandum of agreement with a third party for 
the disposal of Alam Kekal for a cash consideration of JPY4.430 billion (equivalent to approximately RM140.062 million 
on date of disposal). The disposal was completed on 16 October 2023. 
 
(c) Acquisition of Land, Joint Venture and Diversification
 On 29 August 2023,
i. MBCLH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a SPA with KLSB to acquire a parcel of freehold 
land measuring approximately 23.48 hectares located in Mukim Kapar, Daerah Klang, Negeri Selangor for a total 
cash consideration of RM165 million (“Acquisition of Land”).
ii. the Company entered into a SSA with GVV for the subscription of new ordinary shares in MBCLH, where the 
Company and GVVSB shall respectively hold 60% and 40% equity interest in MBCLH (“Joint Venture”).

suBsequent event
On 27 March 2024, the Company is proposing to undertake 
the following:
i. to seek the approval of its shareholders for the mandate 
to purchase its own ordinary shares for an aggregate 
amount of up to 10% of the issued share capital at any 
point in time (“Proposed Share Buy-Back Authority”); 
and 
ii. a proposed exemption pursuant to subparagraph 4.15(1) 
of the Rules on Take-Overs, Mergers and Compulsory 
Acquisition issued by the Securities Commission 
Malaysia (“SC”) to Dato’ Goh Cheng Huat, a Director 
and major shareholder of the Company and his person(s) 
acting in concert  from the obligation to undertake a 
mandatory take-over offer for all the remaining Maybulk 
Shares not already owned by them arising from the 
purchase by Maybulk of its own Shares pursuant to 
the Proposed Share Buy-Back Authority (“Proposed 
Exemption”).
Collectively referred to as the “Proposals”.
The Proposals are subject to the following approvals being 
obtained:
i. the shareholders of Maybulk for the Proposals at the 
forthcoming EGM to be convened; 
ii. the SC for the Proposed Exemption; and
iii. the approval of any other relevant authorities, if required.
prospect
(a) Shipping Bulkers Segment
 Revenue and profit from the shipping bulkers segment is 
expected to be more stable in 2024 as the only remaining 
vessel, Alam Kuasa, is under long-term contract at fixed 
contracted rate subject to bunker price adjustments and 
will not be affected by open market charter rate volatility. 
Q1 2024 results, however, would be affected by dry 
docking of the vessel for scheduled maintenance.
(b) Shelving and Storage Solutions Segment
 Demand for shelving and storage solution in the industrial 
sector is expected to remain positive with the increase in 
demand for industrial properties as evident by launches 
of new industrial parks in the country, driven by interests 
from foreign investors. The Group will also focus on 
expanding its higher margin gondola shelving product 
range in the retail and commercial sector, targeting 
amongst others, the rapid growing pharmacy chain 
stores in Malaysia.
(c) Warehousing Segment
 No revenue is expected from the warehouse segment 
which will be in the pre-operating and construction phase 
in 2024. While financing cost will be capitalised during 
the construction phase, the 2024 results will be affected 
by loan documentation fee and pre-operating expenses 
incurred. 
 Following shareholders’ approval of the Proposed 
Diversification in December 2023, the Group will continue 
to look for opportunities in its diversification into industrial 
property development and investment and growing its 
shelving and storage solutions business with product 
range and geographical expansion.

Material Sustainability Matters
The Materiality Assessment is a strategic business tool to identify, review and prioritise the material sustainability matters that affect 
our business and stakeholders.  The Group adopted a structured Materiality Assessment process, guided by Bursa Malaysia’s 
Sustainability Reporting Guide to identify and assess the significance of sustainability matters to our business and stakeholder groups. 
We continue to enhance our disclosures on the material sustainability matters which are of high importance to the Group. In 
2023, we conducted a materiality assessment to review the relevance of our material matters through stakeholder engagement 
and sought their views in relation to the ESG topics that were important to the Group. Details of our initiatives and measures 
taken in managing these material sustainability matters are discussed in the subsequent sections of this Statement.

sustainaBility management
The management approach for material matters is set out below:
ENVIRONMENTAL 
While expanding our businesses, the Group is committed to implementing sustainable practices 
and taking proactive initiatives to address our impact on the environment and improve the health 
of ecosystems. 
Related unSDGs:
1.  Climate Change & environment Management
 In addressing the emission and energy impacts, we measured and managed the carbon footprint across all our operations 
both in the Shipping Bulker and Shelving and Storage Solutions segments. 
1.1  Greenhouse gas emissions
 To achieve a greener environment, we have taken proactive initiatives to manage emissions from our vessel. In 
line with International Maritime Organisation (IMO) of Greenhouse Gas Strategy, the Group has embarked on EU 
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) and IMO Data Collection System (DCS) that are developed in the 
context of reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG)/ carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with the target to measure and 
potentially reduce the CO2 emissions.
 The Group has implemented the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for our vessel using the Ship Energy Efficiency 
Management Plan (SEEMP), a tool introduced by the IMO to monitor the amount of CO2 emission and other greenhouse 
gas emissions from ship. Our Technical Department has been tasked to oversee and implement the SEEMP onboard 
the fleet and our vessel is designed to be more fuel efficient and in compliance with the following regulations standard:
(i) Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Tier II – to limit the diesel engine NOx emissions;
(ii) Energy Efficient Design Index (EEDI) – to monitor the amount of CO 2 emission and other greenhouse gas 
emissions from ship;
(iii) Ballast Water Treatment System;
(iv) Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) – to set a standard of energy efficiency for ship; and  
(v) Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) – to calculate annual energy efficiency value of each ship. 
 Apart from taking initiatives based on regulatory standards and keeping ourselves abreast on the available 
technologies in the market for reducing GHG emission, we continuously implement the following strategy:
• Use fuel oil additives to enhance engine combustion of our vessel; 
• Hull coating or anti-fouled coating to slow marine growth on the underwater which would enhance vessel 
performance and durability;
• Propeller cleaning when the propeller curve reaches the engine maker’s indicator; 
• Safe and fuel-efficient route guidance system tool to reduce emissions; and
• White box to enhance vessel operation and monitoring of oily water separator.

1.  Climate Change & environment Management (Cont’d)
1.1  Greenhouse gas emissions (Cont’d)
 In compliance with Regulation 22A of MARPOL Annex VI which requires vessels to collect aggregate and report 
data on its fuel consumption starting from 1 January 2019, we have developed a ship-specific methodology for fuel 
consumption data collection as required by the regulation and reported to the Administration or any organisation 
duly authorised by it. 
 Within the Group, the Operations Department is responsible for the discharge of hold wash water, which might be 
harmful to the marine environment. We strictly ensure that our vessel discharges the hold wash water in line with 
the regulation under MARPOL Annex V. 
 There is no specific target set for reduction in GHG and air pollutants emissions as it is still under data collection 
and monitoring stage. Presently, there is no specific GHG emission target set by IMO, in view that it is complex 
issue apart from the 0.5% sulphur cap and Tier 3 engine on NOx control.
 The future of GHG reduction plan will depend heavily on the available technology in the market, its economic effect 
and the acceptable standards set by the regulatory bodies. As a responsible Ship Manager and Ship Owner, we 
aim to support and participate in any actions to reduce GHG emissions that is within the scope of our business 
and within our means, and to be in full compliance with the IMO’s rules and regulations.
 In year 2023, the Group recorded a decrease in GHG emission corresponding with the change in fleet size during 
the reporting year. The Group’s Kamsarmax ship is environmentally friendly green vessel with enhancements that 
improve efficiency and lowers fuel consumption.

of, and compliance with pollution prevention requirements, 
regulations and standards through continuous review 
of Safety Management System manuals, circulars on 
environmental related matters and seafarer’s education 
via shipboard training, computer-based training, seminars 
and pre-joining ship briefings. 
 By adhering to the Environment Compliance Plan (ECP) and gathering positive feedback on significant environmental 
aspects via “Open and Transparent Reporting System (ORS)”, the Group continuously upholds its environment responsibility 
while highlighting important areas for improvement within the shipping operations.
In year 2023, there was no major deficiency issued from ECP annual audit for the Group’s owned fleet.

  For Shelving and Storage Solutions segment, the Group utilises natural resources 
by putting up several solar lights posts for usage at night and installed roof 
skylights at the Jeram warehouse. To conserve and reduce energy consumption, 
the Group also encourages to install eco-green air-conditioners, switch off lights 
or other electrical devices when not in use.
 
 The Group consumed total of 30.734 mw of electricity in FY2023.    
1.3  w aste management
 In adhering to environment regulations, the Group had adopted the 3R efforts – reduce, reuse and recycle in the 
operations procedure to cultivate a green and healthy practice. We ensure that our scheduled wastes are properly 
stored and managed till final disposal to approved waste facilities.
(i) Shipping Bulker 
 All accumulated garbage is compressed to its minimum possible size prior to disposal at shore facilities. The 
average monthly garbage production in FY2023 was 1.03m3 (FY2022: 1.24m3) per ship, below our target 
of 1.33m3.
(ii) Shelving and Storage Solutions 
 We established various initiatives to increase awareness among our employees in an effort to reduce waste 
such as:
• Segregation of non-recyclable and recyclable waste;
•  Minor defect parts are repainted and re-bent for resell;   
• Promote digitalisation and paperless environment.

2. Ocean health
 The Group recognises the importance in preserving health and value of the marine ecosystem and biodiversity. Operating 
in a highly regulated industry, we are committed to safeguarding the environment by ensuring full compliance with all 
relevant local and international laws and operate efficiently to minimise the impact on the environment. Ashore and at 
sea, we comply with the mandatory ISM code and other relevant regulatory requirements that prescribe system controls, 
procedural safeguards and training to prevent and respond to oil spillage.
 The Group outsourced its entire fleet management who is ultimately responsible in establishing environmental objectives 
and targets for the vessel and office departments on an annual basis. The Designated Person is responsible in monitoring 
the safety and pollution-prevention aspects of the operation of each ship and ensuring that adequate resources and 
shore-based support are applied, as required. 
 We strive to ensure that significant environmental aspects are considered in establishing, implementing, and maintaining 
our environmental management system. We also regularly identify the environmental aspects of all the Group’s activities 
and services to determine those that have or can have significant impacts on the environment. 
 In FY2023, there is no penalty due to non-compliance with IMO as our ship is an environmentally friendly green vessel 
and equipped with the IMO approved Ballast Water Treatment System to prevent the introduction of non-native marine 
microorganisms. 
 Oily bilge water is processed through Oily Water Separator, and residual oil will be retained on board till subsequent 
disposal to approved reception facilities. The Group installed additional protection system to enhance monitoring and 
control, and to prevent illegal discharge of oily bilge water.
 Reducing the production of oily bilge water generated minimizes the environmental impact and this is accomplished 
through proper housekeeping and maintenance.

SOCIAL
At the Group, workplace safety is our utmost priority. We strongly believe our employees whether in 
the warehouse or crew onshore or at sea should have a safe and healthy working environment, not 
only for the individual’s well-being but for the interest of the Group as a whole. 
Related unSDGs:
3. w orkplace health and Safety
 To mitigate work-related accidents and ensure a safe working environment for our shelving and storage solutions employees 
at the Jeram warehouse operation, periodic meetings will be held to regulate operational matters and discuss occurrence 
of accidents and prevention measures. The Group provides health and safety training at the point of onboarding, on-the 
job and regular refresher training to employees.
 On the shipping bulker segment, the Group recognises the objectives as advocated in the IMO’s International Safety 
Management Code which emphasises on safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life and avoidance of damage 
to the environment, specifically the marine ecosystem which is aligned with our aspirations. 
 We have in place a Safety Management Manual (SMM), which complies with the requirements of the American Bureau 
of Shipping Guide for Marine Management Systems that have been largely derived from the sound management system 
principles reflected in the ISM Code, ISO14001:2015 and other industry-driven requirements. Detailed instructions and 
procedures that are formulated within the system are reviewed annually to ensure safe operations of ships and environmental 
protection in compliance with international and Flag State legislations. 
 Relief of crew is essential in ensuring the safety, health and welfare of seafarers. In 2023, the Group continues to champion 
the safety and wellbeing of our seafarers and offshore employees through the following programs and initiatives:
•  Participated in the International Seafarer’s Welfare & Assistance Network (ISWAN) to provide 24x7 assistance via 
helpline for crew;
• Participated in the Neptune Declaration for Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change that prioritises safety and wellbeing 
of seafarers;
• Rolled out Health and Wellbeing campaign through online audio-visual training;  
• Sufficient supply of medication and personal injury prevention training on board vessels; 
• Emergency Response Drill was conducted annually to ensure crew familiarise with their roles and protocols outlined 
in the Emergency Response Manual. 
 Our other health and safety obligations are also set out in our Declaration of Maritime Labour Convention and Collective 
Agreement with the trade union.

Policy 
 The Management has established a complete and 
comprehensive HSE Safety Management Manual that clearly 
stipulates in detail, the procedures and measures required to 
meet the abovementioned objectives. The Manual underlines 
the importance of giving a high priority and compliance to the 
client’s own rules, regulations, and standards. 
 To create awareness on health and safety among the employees 
and crew, all the Policy Statements are posted on the notice 
boards at the various locations in our fleet of vessel, across 
the offices respectively. 
 Within our shipping operations, a Safety Committee is 
constituted onboard every ship. Whilst the Master is responsible 
for the overall safety of the ship and those onboard, the Ship’s 
Safety Officer and Safety Committee have important roles to 
play in promoting an attitude of safety consciousness and 
accident prevention amongst the crew.
3.2  Personal Protective equipment (“PPe”)
 All personnel must adhere to HSE policy and shall wear adequate PPEs that is suitable for the nature of work being 
carried out. Our policy requires our employees and seafarers to wear adequate protective equipment, as one of 
the minimum safety requirements prior to carrying out any work at the warehouse and onboard the vessel. 
 The Group practices good hygiene to mitigate the impact of the outbreak and ensure adequate supplies of PPE for 
employees and crew. All employees and crew are required to maintain high level of personal hygiene and adhere 
to the safety management measures. Disciplinary action for non-compliance is a warning for initial offence and 
dismissal for a repeated offence. PPEs are regarded as the last defence barrier in the avoidance of personal injury. 
The conditions of PPEs are regularly checked.
3.3  Safety and health training 
 A workplace accident can change a life forever, which is why the Group is committed to empowering employees 
and crew with the tools, resources and training necessary to take charge of their own safety and look out for their 
colleagues. Onboard safety training begins at the cadet level and continues at all ranks throughout the career 
of a seafarer of the Group. Through training, drills and exercises, crew members learn or refresh vital skills and 
knowledge to recognise and mitigate workplace hazards and ensure the safe operation of our ship. 
 Extensive safety training, covering a wide range of areas, including emergency procedures and environmental 
awareness are provided to ship crew members. Prior to joining a vessel, a safety briefing is provided to the crew. 
During crew and officer’s seminar, presentation on safety topic is carried out to increase safety awareness. 
 As part of our efforts to further improve the Group’s safety performance, safety statistics and data are analysed to 
identify the most common injuries faced by our employees, as well as the most common basic risk factors. This 
in-depth analysis allows the Group to focus on areas of concerns and formulate action plans to mitigate the risks 
identified.

(STCW) Convention;
(b) Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006;
(c) International Safety Management (ISM) Code; and
(d) Minimum Safe Manning Document.
 In ensuring that all crew members obtain the relevant qualifications and certifications, we provide in-depth training 
based on these regulations, onboard the vessel and ashore. 
 We regularly carry out inspections to check on the documentation of the crew upon hiring and joining the ship. To 
ensure comprehensive inspections, proper checklists are in place to assist monitoring and checking while immediate 
actions are taken on any reports of non-compliance. Any non-conformity raised by the Port State Control (PSC), 
ISM and MLC during inspections are strictly rectified to prevent recurrence. 
 We work with various forums in the maritime industry, such as Neptune Declaration 2021 for Seafarer Wellbeing 
and Crew Change guidelines imposed by local jurisdiction, increase collaboration between ship operators and 
charterers to facilitate crew changes and ensure air connectivity between key maritime hubs for seafarers. 
6.   Business Development and Financial Performance
 The Group’s long-term value creation considers all stakeholder interests. We recognise the value brought to our stakeholders 
by building sustainable relationship with stakeholders and consistently deliver sustainable returns by strengthening our 
businesses and capitalising on future growth opportunities.
 Equity Structure
 
 In FY2023, the Group and the Company reviewed their respective equity structure and has carried out a capital reduction 
exercise to cancel the share capital of the Group and of the Company amounted to RM275.0 million, being share capital 
which are no longer represented by assets.
 The Group and the Company have also reviewed the past accounting treatment of foreign currency translation differences 
arising from translation of statements of financial positions denominated in foreign currency. Consequently, prior year 
adjustments of RM76.267 million and RM116.302 million by the Group and the Company were made to reduce the 
foreign currency translation reserve and enhance the retained earnings.
 These improved the distributability of the Group and the Company’s reserves.
 Shipping Bulker segment
 The Group expects revenue and profit from its Shipping Bulkers Segment to be more stable and not affected by the 
international supply and demand for seaborne trade or the global charter rates as the remaining vessel is under long term 
contract with secured charter rates. 
 
 The Group has also rolled out cost management measures in procurement of parts and services, improve operational 
efficiency in minimising critical machinery failure, reduce vessel downtime and operating costs.

9.  Data Privacy and Security (Cont’d)
 On crew operations, with data enhancements and optimising system utility, automated checks and validation will be 
implemented for crew documentation and crew movement. 
 The hacking of vessels’ Information Technology and Operational Technology systems pose a danger to seafarers and 
vessels. The Group ensured its compliance in cybersecurity by putting in place user awareness programs, policies and 
procedures and NextGen technologies by deploying various tools such as AI powered NextGen anti-malware, passive 
network monitoring tool and enhanced security email systems onboard all owned vessels. The Group also has in place 
cybersecurity programmes that cover comprehensive user awareness, tighten controls and a dedicated cybersecurity 
team to monitor and protect the systems and network from malicious cyberattacks including strengthening endpoint 
server, mobile security and end-user education. The email system (Dualog), a control to minimise phishing threat and 
Network Monitoring Tool (CyberOwl) with enhanced security to monitor crew compliance are effectively deployed to ease 
identification of external emails.
There were zero complaints on breaches of data privacy or security breach for FY2023. 
10.  Disaster Response     
 Maritime disaster management plays an important role in minimising the Group’s risks in the event of maritime disasters 
(e.g. vessel collision, fire & explosion, climate/bad weather, security and piracy), which may result in financial losses, 
operational inefficiencies and environmental damage. In severe cases, it may even lead to the loss of customers and 
damage to brand reputation.
 The overall responsibility of managing maritime disaster lies with the Crisis Management Team (CMT). CMT provides 
the required assistance and guides decision-making for our vessels in any emergency situations. Most of the Senior 
Management of CMT are trained for crisis management and media handling.
 The Group has implemented the Emergency Response Manual which comprehensively details out the steps or actions 
and contingency plans to be taken during any emergency cases. All our ships have been provided with Shipboard 
Emergency Response Plan and a checklist for the employees and seafarers to use during any emergency. 
 A Crisis Management Plan is also in place for our shore management to ensure continuous safe operation in the event 
of an onboard emergency. The plan addresses matters ranging from safeguarding of life, preservation of property to the 
minimisation of environmental impact as a result of a crisis. 
   
10.1 t rainings and drills 
 At the Group, trainings and drills are held as realistic as possible. Participation in the training and drills is mandatory 
to all relevant personnel. All the relevant equipment such as fire pumps, survival craft are maintained in readiness 
for use in emergencies. 
 We ensure that at least once a year, each ship is involved in a selected drill together with other parties such 
as Manning Agents, our clients, Oil Spill Response Organisations, Classification Society Emergency Response 
Service and media representatives to ensure adequate response to hazards, accidents and emergency situations 
at shipboard. An annual communication drill is also carried out between ship and shore offices.

The Board of Directors (“the Board”) is pleased to present the Group’s Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control 
for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and made pursuant to Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing 
Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. This statement has been prepared in accordance with the Statement on 
Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers (“the Guidelines”) endorsed by the Bursa 
Malaysia Securities Berhad as well as Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”). 
BOARD RESPONSIBILITY 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility and commitment for the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management 
and internal control system to achieve its business objectives. 
The Board recognises that effective risk management and a sound system of internal control are fundamental to good corporate 
governance and the Board has in place an on-going process for identifying, evaluating, and managing the significant risks 
encountered by the Group. The Board, through its Audit and Risk Management Committee (‘ARMC’), review results of this 
process on a periodic basis to ensure adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system and resilience in the 
current business environment. 
The Board is of the view that the risk management and internal control system is adequate and operating effectively in all 
material aspects dealing with risks for the financial year under review and up to the date of issuance of the financial statements 
to safeguard shareholders’ investment, stakeholders’ interest and the Group’s assets. 
However, as the risk management and internal control system is designed to manage and mitigate risks rather than eliminate 
risks of failure to achieve corporate objectives, the system would therefore provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance 
against any material misstatements of financial information or losses, contingencies, fraud or irregularities.
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY
The Board is assisted by Management in designing and implementing its policies and procedures on risk management and 
internal control. It is the responsibility of management to ensure effective risk management and adequacy of internal control 
of the Group’s daily business operations and to cultivate a culture of risk awareness within the Group as managing risk is 
everyone’s responsibility. 
The risk owners reside with the Business Unit Head where they are responsible in managing day to day risk management and 
accountable for on-going risks monitoring, assessment of adequacy and effectiveness of its controls mechanism as well as 
develop and implement action plans to manage these risks.          
AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (ARMC)
The ARMC comprises of three (3) members of whom are Independent Non-Executive Directors and assists the Board on the 
oversight of the Group’s management of key risks, including strategic and operational risks, as well as policies and processes 
for monitoring and mitigating such risks. The ARMC determines the Group’s risk strategies and policies and oversee the 
management of all identified risks which includes the continuous identification, measurement, controlling and monitoring of all 
relevant, significant and emerging risks of the Group.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 
Risk management framework, which set out the nature and extent of risks that the Group is willing to accept or retain in pursuit 
of its goals and objectives, are reviewed by the ARMC and approved by the Board.
The Board has made risk assessment an on-going exercise to effectively identify, evaluate, manage and review any changes 
in the risk faced by businesses in the Group. The risk management process involves a systematic application of the risk 
management methodology to facilitate risk identification, assessment, planning, mitigation as well as monitoring and review. 
The risk approach is summarised as follows.
•	 Identifying	and	Evaluating	Risks:		
 All potential and material risks, whether strategic, operation, reporting or compliance levels that could adversely impact 
the Group’s business operations are identified. Management will perform risk assessment which involves developing an 
understanding of the identified risks and quantified for their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the relevant 
business strategies or objectives.
•	 Managing	Risks:
 Management will determine appropriate control strategies to address each identified risk and develop action plans to manage 
residual risk. The Key Risk Indicators (KRI) are also established to monitor risks that are material to the Group. Additionally, 
Management will conduct periodic reviews and monitor the effectiveness of the action plan towards risk profiles. 
•	 Reporting	Risks
 Management will report to the ARMC the risk profiles in a heat map which focuses on risk mitigation strategies based on 
risk rating at gross and net levels. The net risk level is determined after taking into consideration various mitigation factors 
including existing and planned internal controls. Changes to risk profiles and emerging risks are identified and promptly 
brought to the attention of the ARMC and the Board. 
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE GROUP’S RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The risk management and internal control processes are embedded within the operations of the Group. The key elements of 
controls that are in place for the year under review are as follows:-
(a) Control Structure
 The Board has delegated authority to various Board Committees such as the ARMC and the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee to enable them to oversee certain specific responsibilities based on clearly defined terms of reference. Any 
change to the terms of reference for any Board Committee requires the Board’s approval.
 Further details on the structures of the Board and Board Committees are provided under Corporate Information as well

Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of provision for doubtful 
debts, and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate provision had been 
made for doubtful debts; and

(iii) adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or 
inappropriate; or

(i) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which 
secures the liabilities of any other person; and

In the opinion of the Directors:

REPORT ON THE AuDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Maybulk Berhad (formerly known as Malaysian Bulk Carriers Berhad), which 
comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements 
of	profit	or	loss	and	other	comprehensive	income,	statements	of	changes	in	equity	and	statements	of	cash	flows	of	the	Group	
and of the Company for the financial year then ended, including a summary of material accounting policy information, as set 
out on pages 78 to 124.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and 
of	the	Company	as	at	31	December	2023,	and	of	their	financial	performance	and	cash	flows	for	the	financial	year	then	
ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.
Basis	for	opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on 
Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Independence	and	other	ethical	responsibilities
We are independent of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the 
Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International 
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key	audit	matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
(1) Goodwill on consolidation
 The	risk
 The Group is required to test annually the amount of goodwill for impairment. The impairment testing relies on estimates 
of	value-in-use	based	on	estimated	future	cash	flows.
 The annual impairment test of goodwill is significant to our audit because the assessment process used in preparing 
the	estimated	future	cash	flows	is	complex	and	highly	judgemental	and	is	based	on	assumptions	that	are	affected	by	
expected future market or economic conditions.
	 The	Group's	disclosure	about	goodwill	are	included	in	Note	11	to	the	Financial	Statements.

REPORT ON THE AuDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINuED)
Key	audit	matters	(Continued)
(1) Goodwill on consolidation (Continued)
 Our	response
 We performed amongst others, the following audit procedures:
•	 evaluating	 the	assumptions	and	methodologies	used	by	the	Group,	in	particular	those	relating	to	the	forecasted	
revenue growth, expenses and profit margins.
 When evaluating and challenging the key assumptions used by management in conducting the impairment review, 
we using our valuation specialists to independently develop expectations for the key macro-economic assumptions 
used in the impairment analysis, in particular the discount rate and long-term growth rate, and comparing the 
independent	expectations	to	those	used	by	management;	challenging	the	cash	flow	forecast	used;	with	comparison	
to recent performance, trend analysis and market expectations; where relevant, assessing whether the Group has 
achieved them.
•	 assessed	the	appropriateness	of	disclosures	of	significant	inputs	in	the	financial	statements.
(2) Impairment of investment in subsidiaries at Company level 
The	risk
 As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries (net of accumulated 
impairment loss) amounted to RM260.72 million, representing approximately 46.4% of the Company’s total assets.
 Significant judgements are required by the Directors in assessing the impairment and the recoverability of the investment 
in	subsidiaries.	This	is	based	on	the	value-in-use,	using	cash	flow	projections,	covering	a	five-year	period	for	each	cash-
generating	unit.	The	assumptions	with	the	most	significant	judgement	on	the	cash	flow	projections	are	growth	rates	and	
profit margins.
 The impairment assessment is complex and it involves significant management’s judgement. Accordingly, we have 
identified this to be an area of audit focus.
 Our	response
 We performed amongst others, the following audit procedures:
•	 discussed	 and	 evaluated	 management’s	assessment	 on	 the	 indications	 of	 impairment	 of	 the	 investment	
in subsidiaries including factors that may indicate the impairment loss previously made may be reversed;  
•	 obtained	 an	understanding	of	and	assessed	the	appropriateness	of	the	methodology	and	approach	used	in	the	
impairment assessment; and
•	 evaluated	 the	reasonableness	of	the	fair	value	of	the	assets	and	liabilities	of	the	subsidiaries	including	the	
assumptions applied in determining the recoverable amounts either through fair value less costs to sell or value in 
use, as part of the impairment assessment.

REPORT ON THE AuDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINuED)
Information	other	than	the	financial	statements	and	auditors’	report	thereon
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ 
report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other 
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of 
the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities	of	the	Directors	for	the	financial	statements
The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the 
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and 
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to 
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’	responsibilities	for	the	audit	of	the	financial	statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our 
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could	reasonably	be	expected	to	influence	the	economic	decisions	of	users	taken	on	the	basis	of	these	financial	statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
•	 Identify	 and	assess	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	of	the	Company,	
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence 
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;
•	 Obtain	 an	understanding	of	internal	control	relevant	to	the	audit	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	appropriate	
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s internal control;
•	 Evaluate	 the	appropriateness	of	accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	accounting	estimates	and	related	
disclosures made by the Directors;

REPORT ON THE AuDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINuED)
Auditors’	responsibilities	for	the	audit	of	the	financial	statements	(Continued)
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (Continued)
•	 Conclude	 on	the	appropriateness	of	the	Directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	and,	based	on	the	audit	
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s or the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group 
and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern;
•	 Evaluate	 the	overall	presentation,	structure	and	content	of	the	financial	statements	of	the	Group	and	of	the	Company,	
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; and
•	 Obtain	 sufficient	appropriate	audit	evidence	regarding	the	financial	information	of	the	entities	or	business	activities	
within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. 
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, 
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGuLATORY REQuIREMENTS
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have 
not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.

 The principal activities of the Company are investment holding, ship owning and ship operating.
 The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.
 There have been no significant changes to these principal activities during the financial year except as disclosed in Note 
15 to the Financial Statements.
 The Company changed its name from Malaysian Bulk Carriers Berhad to Maybulk Berhad with effect from 13 December 
2023.
 The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the 
Directors on 29 April 2024.
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION
2.1 Statement of compliance and basis of measurement
 The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance  with  Malaysian  
Financial  Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), IFRS  Accounting Standards  and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016 in Malaysia.
 The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting 
policies below.
 The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (RM) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(RM'000)	except	otherwise	indicated.
2.2 Foreign currency
(i) Functional and presentation currency
 Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of 
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates, i.e. the functional currency. The functional 
currency of the Company is United States Dollar (USD). The financial statements of the Group and of the 
Company are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (RM), and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 
(RM'000)	except	otherwise	indicated.
2.3 Adoption of Amendments to MFRSs
 On 1 January 2023, the Group and the Company adopted the followings new and amended MFRSs and interpretation 
mandatory for annual financial periods being on or after 1 January 2023. The details of the amendments are 
disclosed below:
 Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies
 The amendments change the requirements in MFRS 101 with regard to disclosure of accounting policies. The 
amendments replace all instances of the term ‘significant’ with ‘material’. Accounting policy information is material 
if, when considered together with other information included in an entity’s financial statements, it can reasonably be 
expected	to	influence	decisions	that	the	primary	users	of	general-purpose	financial	statements	make	on	the	basis	
of those financial statements.
NOTES TO ThE fINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 31 December 2023

---- Page 89 ----
87
2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINuED)
2.3 Adoption of Amendments to MFRSs (Continued)
 Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies 
(Continued)
 The supporting paragraphs in MFRS 101 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy information that relates 
to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy 
information may be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even 
if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, 
other events or conditions is itself material. The MASB has also developed guidance and examples to explain and 
demonstrate the application of the ‘four-step materiality process’ described in MFRS Practice Statement 2.
 The amendments have had an impact on the Group’s and the Company’s disclosures of accounting policies but 
not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the Company’s financial statements.
 Amendments to MFRS 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors - 
Definition of Accounting Estimates
 The amendments to MFRS 108 clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in 
accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates. 
 This distinction between these two types of changes is important as changes in accounting policies are normally 
applied retrospectively to past transactions and events, whereas changes in accounting estimates are applied 
prospectively to future transactions and events.
 The amendments had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
2.4 Standards issued but not yet effective
 The standards, amendments and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of 
the	Group's	and	the	Company's	financial	statements	are	disclosed	as	below.	The	Group	and	the	Company	intend	
to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.

2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINuED)
2.5 Prior year adjustments
  For companies in the Group where the functional currency is different from the reporting currency, during the year, 
the Group and the Company adopted an accounting policy to reverse the cumulative foreign currency translation 
reserve associated with non-current assets when such asset is disposed, monetised or written off and to reverse 
the cumulative foreign currency translation reserve associated with monetary assets when such monetary assets 
is paid out as dividend.
 The Group and the Company recognise as prior year adjustments, the reversals arose from the past disposals, 
monetisation and write-off of non-current assets and payment of dividends in prior years.
 When the Group or the Company fully disposed of or redemption of its investment in subsidiaries from the operations 
that denominated in functional currencies other than RM, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation 
reserve related to that investment is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. When 
the Group or the Company distribute the dividend from the operations that denominated in functional currencies 
other than RM, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to the realisation portion 
is reclassified to retained earnings as and when the dividend is declared.
 The following table summarises the impact of the change in policy on the financial statements of the Group and of 
the Company. There is no material impact on the Group’s basic or diluted earnings per share and no impact on the 
total	operating,	investing	or	financing	cash	flows	for	the	year	ended	31	December	2022	and	31	December	2023.

3. MATERIAL ACCOuNTING POLICIES
 The Group and the Company apply the material accounting policies, as summarised below, consistently throughout all 
years presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.
3.1 Inventories
 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using 
first-in, first-out basis. 
3.2 Intangible assets
 Intangible assets, other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group and the Company, which have finite useful 
lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and less any accumulated impairment losses.
 Costs relating to computer software acquired, which are not an integral part of related hardware, are capitalised 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life of 3 years.
3.3 Property, plant and equipment
(a) Recognition and measurement 
 All property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any 
impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and 
only	if,	it	is	probable	that	future	economic	benefit	associated	with	the	item	will	flow	to	the	Group	and	the	cost	
of the item can be measured reliably.

3. MATERIAL ACCOuNTING POLICIES (CONTINuED)
3.3 Property, plant and equipment (Continued)
(b) Depreciation
 Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
component of an item of property, plant and equipment from the date that they are available for use.
 Leasehold properties are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and the lease terms, i.e. 
87 years.
 Depreciation of new vessels is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost, less estimated 
scrap value over their estimated useful lives of 25 years, whilst for used vessels purchased, depreciation is 
calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost less estimated scrap value over their remaining 
useful lives. 
 Dry docking costs, which enhance the useful lives of the vessels, are capitalised in the year in which they are 
incurred and amortised over periods between 2 to 3 years until the next dry docking.
 For acquisitions and disposals of vessels and dry docking costs during the financial year, depreciation is 
provided from the day of acquisition and to the earlier of the day before disposal or the day classified as asset 
held for sale respectively. Fully depreciated assets are retained in the books until they are no longer in use.
 Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated based on the useful lives of the assets are as follows:
Office equipment 3 - 5 years
Machinery 6.67 years
Renovations 3 - 5 years
Furniture and fittings 5 - 10 years
Store racking 5 years
Motor vehicle 5 years
3.4 Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets at amortised cost include receivables and most of the other 
current assets, amount due from subsidiaries, short-term deposits and investments and cash and bank 
balances.
(ii) Financial liabilities
 The Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities at amortised cost includes payables and other liabilities, 
dividend payable, amount due to subsidiaries and borrowings.
3.5 Leases
(i) Recognition exemption
 The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-
term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The Group and the 
Company recognise the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.

3.5 Leases (Continued)
(ii)  Depreciation
 Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the 
estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Vessels	 2	-	4	years
Office lease 3 years
Buildings 2 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
3.6 Investment properties
 Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Leasehold properties are depreciated over 
the shorter of their estimated useful lives and lease terms, i.e. 87 years.
3.7 Fair value measurements
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the 
asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market, in the 
most advantageous market. 
 The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.
	 A	 fair	value	measurement	of	a	non-financial	asset	takes	into	account	a	market	participant's	ability	to	generate	
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use.
 The Group and the Company use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which 
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising 
the use of unobservable inputs.
 Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation 
technique as follows:
Level	1:	 Quoted	prices	(unadjusted)	in	active	markets	for	identical	assets	or	liabilities
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset 
  or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs)
 The Group and the Company recognise transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the 
event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers.

3. MATERIAL ACCOuNTING POLICIES (CONTINuED)
3.8 Significant accounting judgements and estimates
 The preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and 
liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting date. However, uncertainty about 
these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.
 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
 The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of each reporting 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. The Group and the Company based their assumptions and estimates on 
parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about 
future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the 
Group	and	of	the	Company.	Such	changes	are	reflected	in	the	assumptions	when	they	occur.
 Recoverable amounts of vessels
 The recoverable amount of vessel classified as property, plant and equipment is determined based on the higher of 
its	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	and	its	value-in-use	(“VIU”),	whereas	the	recoverable	amount	of	vessel	classified	as	
right-of-use	asset	is	based	on	its	VIU.	When	fair	value	less	costs	to	sell	is	used,	management	engages	the	services	
of professional valuers to determine the fair values based on past transactions in the industry with comparable 
characteristics as at previous financial year.
 The carrying amounts of the Group’s and of the Company’s vessels classified as property, plant and equipment and 
right-of-use assets are disclosed in Notes 12 and 14 to the Financial Statements respectively.
 Impairment of investment in subsidiaries
 The Company assesses at the end of each reporting date whether there is indication that the investment are 
impaired or the impairment loss made previously may be reversed. Management considers various internal and 
external factors including the financial position of the subsidiaries.
 In performing the impairment assessment, the Company estimates the recoverable amounts of the investment in 
subsidiaries by making reference to the fair value of their assets and liabilities including the recoverable amounts of 
the subsidiaries. The carrying amounts of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries as at 31 December 2023 are 
disclosed in Note 15 to the Financial Statements.
 Impairment of non-financial assets
 An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future 
cash	flows	from	each	asset	or	cash-generating	unit	(“CGU”)	and	determines	a	suitable	interest	rate	in	order	to	
calculate	the	present	value	of	those	cash	flows.
 
	 The	 recoverable	amount	of	a	CGU	is	determined	based	on	VIU	calculations	using	cash	flow	projections	derived	
from financial budgets approved by management. Management has made estimates about future results and 
key	assumptions	applied	to	cash	flow	projections	of	the	CGUs.	These	key	assumptions	are	applied	to	cash	flow	
projections of the CGUs and include forecast growth in future revenues and operating profit margins, as well as 
determining appropriate pre-tax discount rates and growth rates.
	 In	 the	process	of	measuring	expected	future	cash	flows,	management	makes	assumptions	about	future	operating	
results. The actual results may vary, and may cause significant adjustments to the Group’s and the Company’s 
assets within the next financial year.
 In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustments to market 
risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

3. MATERIAL ACCOuNTING POLICIES (CONTINuED)
3.8 Significant accounting judgements and estimates (Continued)
 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)
 Classification between investment properties and owner-occupied properties
 The Group and the Company determine whether a property qualifies as an investment property, and has developed 
criteria in making that judgement. Investment property is a property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation 
or	both.	Therefore,	the	Group	and	the	Company	consider	whether	a	property	generates	cash	flows	largely	
independently of the other assets held by the Group and the Company.
 Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another portion that 
is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. The Group and the 
Company account for the portions separately if the portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately 
under a finance lease). If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is an investment property only if an 
insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
 Judgement is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that 
a property does not qualify as an investment property.
 Provision for expected credit losses of receivables
 The Group and Company use a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables. The provision rates are based 
on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., by geography, 
product type, customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance).
 The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s and the Company’s historical observed default rates. The 
Group and the Company will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking 
information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e., gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate 
over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical 
default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes 
in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
 The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and 
ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast 
economic conditions. The Group’s and the Company’s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic 
conditions may also not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future.
 Inventories
 Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In estimating net realisable values, 
management takes into account the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made. The 
Group’s and the Company’s core business is subject to economical changes which may cause selling prices to 
change rapidly and the Group’s and the Company’s result to change.
 Determining the functional currency
 Judgement is applied in determining the Group’s and the Company’s functional currency wherever the indications 
are mixed. The Group and the Company use, in hierarchy, sales indicators as the primary basis, followed by 
purchases and operating expense indicators, and in the event that those indicators are not conclusive, the currency 
in which borrowings and other funds are raised for financing the Group’s and the Company’s operations.
 Income taxes 
 Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group’s and the Company’s provision for income taxes. There 
are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. The Group and the Company recognise tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional 
taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially 
recognised, such difference will impact the income tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.

(a) Revenue from freight services
 Voyage charter
 All freight income and voyage expenses are recognised rateably over the voyage duration as the freight services are 
rendered, determined based on the percentage of the estimated duration of the voyage completed at the reporting date. 
According to this method, freight income and related expenses are recognised in profit or loss according to the contracts 
entered into between the charter parties from the vessel’s load date to the discharge of the cargo. The voyage begins from 
the loading to the discharging of cargo for the voyage (load-to-discharge). This applies to all spot transports and transport 
under Contracts of Affreightment (“COA”). Costs directly attributable to relocating the vessel to the load port under the 
contract are capitalised to the extent that they are recoverable. Demurrage is recognised if the claim is considered probable.
 Time charter
 Revenue from time charter is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of each charter, as service is 
performed.
(b)  Brokerage and commission and ship management income are recognised when services are rendered.
(c) Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at a point in time when the control of the asset is transferred to the 
customer, generally upon delivery of goods.
 Contract liabilities represent charter hire received in advance for freight services at reporting date and the balances of this 
account vary depending on the billing cycle on time charters. The amount of revenue recognised in the financial year that 
was included in contract liabilities of the Group at the beginning of the year was RM903,000 (2022: RM1,808,000). The 
increase of contract liabilities related to increase of deposits made by customers for the freight services which yet to be 
performed by the Group as at the reporting date.

 Malaysian income tax is calculated at the Malaysian statutory income tax rate of 24% (2022: 24%) of the estimated 
assessable profit for the year. Taxation in foreign jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdiction.
 The shipping income of the Group that is derived from the operations of sea-going Malaysian registered ships and 
Singapore registered ships is exempted from tax under Malaysian Income Tax (Exemption) (No.7) Order 2022 and 
Section 13A of the Singapore Income Tax Act respectively. The income tax expense for the Group is attributable to tax 
in respect of non-tax exempt activities of the Group, mainly from shelving and storage solution segment.

 Goodwill of the Group arose mainly from the acquisition of EMT Systems Sdn. Bhd.. The details are disclosed in the 
Note 15 to the Financial Statements. The aggregate carrying amount of goodwill allocated to shelving & storage solution 
segment.
	 The	 recoverable	amount	for	the	goodwill	was	based	on	its	VIU	and	was	determined	by	discounting	the	future	cash	flows	
generated from the continuing use of those units and was based on the following key assumptions:
-	 Cash	flows	were	projected	based	on	actual	operating	results	and	a	5-year	business	plan;
- Revenue was projected at anticipated annual revenue growth of approximately 2% to 8% per annum;
- Expenses were projected at annual increase of approximately 5% per annum; and
- A pre-tax discount rate of 10.72% was applied in determining the recoverable amount of goodwill. The discount 
rate was estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital the Group plus a reasonable risk premium.

30. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
 
 The Group is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial 
risks include currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The board of Directors reviews and agrees 
policies and procedures for the management of these risks.
(a) Currency risk
	 Currency	 risk	is	the	risk	that	the	value	of	a	financial	instrument	will	fluctuate	due	to	changes	in	foreign	exchange	
rates.
 The Group has investments in subsidiaries, whose net assets are measured in their functional currency which is 
the Ringgit Malaysia, and are subject to foreign currency translation differences upon translation into United States 
Dollars for consolidation purposes.

Sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk
 
 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s and Company’s profit/equity to a reasonable 
possible change in the RM exchange rate against the functional currency of the Group and Company, with all other 
variables held constant.

  - weakened by 5%   (5,609)  (1,513)  (5,502)  (1,464)
(b) Interest rate risk
 
	 Interest	 rate	risk	is	the	risk	that	fair	value	or	future	cash	flows	of	financial	instrument	will	fluctuate	because	of	
changes in market interest rates.  The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to interest-bearing 
debts. The Group manages its interest rate exposure by closely monitoring the debt market and where necessary, 
maintaining	a	prudent	mix	of	fixed	and	floating	rate	borrowings	and	a	mix	of	interest	revision	dates.	This	strategy	
allows it to capitalise on cheaper funding in a low interest rate environment and achieve a certain level of protection 
against rate hikes.

30. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINuED)
(c) Liquidity risk
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due 
to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatch of 
the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s objective is to maintain a balance 
between	continuity	of	funding	and	flexibility	through	the	use	of	stand-by	credit	facilities.
 The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk is manageable and is addressed via internal funding 
as well as through sourcing of external borrowings. It is the Group’s and the Company’s policy for the placing of 
surplus funds to be managed centrally.
 The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities at the end of 
the reporting period based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.

    151,271   153,500   153,500   – 
 The maturity profile of financial liabilities of the Company based on the contractual undiscounted repayment 
obligation is less than a year.
(d) Credit risk
 Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default 
on its obligations. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other 
receivables.
 Credit risk, or the risk of counterparties defaulting, is controlled by the application of credit monitoring procedures. 
Credit risks are minimised and monitored by strictly limiting the Group’s association to business partners with good 
credit ratings. Trade receivables are monitored on an on-going basis via Group management reporting procedures.
 Advances are made to subsidiaries in support of their respective principal activities. Surplus cash is placed with a 
number of reputable banks.
 
 At the reporting date, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each class of 
financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position.

31. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

structure	by	taking	into	account	its	current	and	projected	cash	flow,	expansion	and	capital	expenditure	commitments.	
Where necessary, adjustments to the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or the issuance of new shares may be 
considered. The Group does not adopt any formal dividend policy. The debt to equity ratio of the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2023 was 0.003:1 (2022: 0.07:1).

from RM338,791,327.42 to RM63,791,327.42 comprising 1,000,000,000 shares.
 The Capital Reduction entails the cancellation of the issued share capital amounted to RM275.0 million which is 
lost or unrepresented by available assets. 
 The credit arising from the Capital Reduction was set off against the accumulated losses of the Company while the 
balance, was credited to the retained earnings of the Company.
(c) On 20 June 2023, the Company proposed to obtain shareholders’ mandate for the disposal of Alam Kekal, a bulk 
carrier, owned by Kekal Shipping Pte Ltd, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to a non-related 
third party to be identified for a disposal consideration to be determined and satisfied entirely in cash. 
 Upon securing shareholders’ approval, the Company entered into a memorandum of agreement with a third party 
for the disposal of Alam Kekal for a cash consideration of JPY4.430 billion (equivalent to approximately RM140.062 
million on date of disposal). The disposal was completed on 16 October 2023.
