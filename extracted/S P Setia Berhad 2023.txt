Sustainability @ S P Setia
5INTEGRATED REPORT4 S P SETIA BERHAD 2023
Since the publishing of our first sustainability statement in 
2016, we have steadily strengthened our approach to 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters across 
our business and supply chain. This includes the creation 
of specific policies and committees to govern our approach 
to sustainability issues, the launch of our Sustainability 
Framework and the introduction of various green products 
and solutions to our developments. 
Charting a sustainable course 
forward, we are in the process 
of establishing our emissions 
baseline. This will enable 
us to set clear, time-
based targets for 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions, bringing us closer 
towards our goal of becoming a 
net-zero company by 2050.

THE S P SETIA SUSTAINABILITY 
FRAMEWORK
Our Sustainability Framework was revised in 2022 to 
accurately reflect our holistic approach to ESG matters. 
The updated framework enshrines the creation of 
sustainable communities as the ultimate goal of our 
efforts and aligns our three sustainability themes with 
specific UNSDGs that we strive to advance through 
our work. It empowers a collective, concerted approach 
to creating long-term value.

Most notably, we are proud to have successfully completed the following two high-rise residential international developments:

3 International
UNO Melbourne (Australia) and Battersea Power Station
(London, UK)
1 UNO Melbourne 
In September 2023, we achieved a milestone with the completion of
UNO Melbourne (Stage 2), located at A’Beckett Street in Melbourne, 
Australia, entailing the delivery of 435 units out of the total 638 high-
rise apartment units. Stage 1, comprising 203 apartment units, was 
fully completed in November 2022. UNO Melbourne offers convenient 
access to public transportation, being close to Melbourne Central 
Station and Elizabeth Street trams
2 KOA at Electric Boulevard
In December 2023, we achieved the completion 
of KOA at Electric Boulevard (Phase 3B) at the 
Battersea Power Station. This development 
includes 204 high-rise apartment units, featuring 
a collection of studio, one-bedroom and two-
bedroom apartments with a contemporary edge
Non-Core Land Sales in FY2023
We have strategically monetised our non-core land bank to address our gearing levels, reduce holding costs and allocate resourc es 
to new projects. Specifically, in Setia Alam, Selangor, the sale of one commercial land parcel in 2023 will serve as a catalyti c 
development in expediting the transformation of Setia City into a fully integrated commercial hub, thereby enhancing the value of 
our remaining undeveloped land bank in Setia Alam.
Joint Ventures & Land Acquisitions
In December 2023, S P Setia entered into a joint venture (“JV”) 
agreement with Mitsui Fudosan (Asia) Malaysia Sdn Bhd (“Mitsui 
Fudosan”) to develop two parcels of commercial land, spanning 
2.67 acres in Setia Federal Hill, Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur. This 
development, valued at an estimated gross development value 
(“GDV”) of RM1.4 billion, will consist of two residential towers. 
This move kickstarts Setia Federal Hill’s journey towards becoming 
a self-sustaining mini metropolis, with an aspiration of elevating 
Kuala Lumpur into a world-class sustainable city of the future.
Expanding our global presence and existing footprint in Melbourne, 
S P Setia made its inaugural foray into Sydney, Australia, in 2023 
with a RM220 million land acquisition at 20 Atchison Street in 
St. Leonards. Strategically positioned in North Shore, Sydney, the 
land is planned for residential development with an estimated 
GDV of AUD236 million (approximately RM708 million).
Digitalisation Progress
Throughout 2023, Team Setia continued to strive for robust 
results, upholding our position as a leading property 
developer in Malaysia.
We upgraded and bolstered our digitalisation efforts with 
the establishment of six major objectives:
– Optimising online marketing;
– Spearheading data-driven marketing;
– Advancing operational excellence;
– Fortifying cybersecurity; 
– Elevating homebuyer experiences; and
– Driving innovation via AI, green IT and strategic 
partnerships
Additionally, we are reinforcing our sustainability practices by 
focusing on progress within the Environment, Sustainability 
and Governance (“ESG”) agenda. As part of our sustainability 
journey centred around economic, environmental and social 
pillars, we aim to foster a culture of innovation and digital 
transformation for the development of top-notch products 
and user experiences, ultimately positioning S P Setia as a 
market leader in ESG initiatives.

We have garnered acclaim for our outstanding township developments, 
with Setia Alam standing as a prime example. Setting ourselves apart as 
pioneers, S P Setia has consistently been at the forefront of eco-themed 
developments, exemplified by the iconic Setia Eco Park. In addition to 
these achievements, our diverse portfolio includes integrated 
developments, showcasing our commitment to innovation, versatility 
and creating communities that transcend traditional living experiences.
 We are a leading Malaysian property developer dedicated 
to creating sustainable living environments within the 
homes and communities we build.
 Positioned as a prominent publicly listed property player 
in the country, we boast a robust portfolio encompassing 
well-planned townships, eco-sanctuaries, premium and 
exclusive enclaves, residences, commercial and retail 
properties, as well as integrated and transit-oriented 
developments strategically located in densely populated 
urban and rapidly growing areas.
Our property development segment spans townships, 
integrated, industrial, eco-themed and niche projects 
in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia and the 
UK.
Our presence in Malaysia is underpinned by our 
success in the Central Region, specifically our 
flagship development Setia Alam – an award-
winning, wholesome, integrated and self-contained 
township with nature-inspired sanctuaries in Shah 
Alam, Selangor. In addition, we have a property 
development footprint in the Northern (Penang), 
Southern (Johor) and Eastern (Sabah) regions of 
Malaysia.
Our latest project – a JV partnership with Mitsui 
Fudosan in FY2023 – will see us develop 2.67 acres 
of prime commercial land in Setia Federal Hill, 
Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, infusing a fresh wave of 
vitality into the vicinity. 
In addition, we are part of a consortium with Sime 
Darby Property Berhad and Malaysia’s Employees 
Provident Fund (“EPF”) for the redevelopment of the 
iconic Battersea Power Station in London, UK.

CHAIRMAN’S
MESSAGE
Dear Shareholders,
2023 marked a significant turning point, especially 
in the latter half, as we observed a consistent 
improvement in the property market, signalling 
perseverance from the challenges posed by the 
rising interest rates, impact of foreign exchange 
and persistent inflation levels.

Since adopting sustainability reporting in 2016, 
our commitment and action on sustainability 
has grown more robust over the years, as 
shown by the important milestones we have 
achieved. Throughout FY2023, we focused on 
fully integrating sustainability goals into our 
business strategies and processes. This 
translates into enhancing how we implement, 
track and monitor sustainability projects, 
cultivating a culture that values and pursues 
sustainability excellence, as well as utilising 
innovation and digital advances to enhance 
our products and customer experiences. The 
Setia Green Roadmap sets out our climate 
action goals and climate-related risks mitigation 
metrics, where we commit to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050, with mid-term targets of a 
45% reduction by 2030 and a 70% reduction 
by 2040 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are 
also finalising our baseline assessment and 
establishing interim targets for Scope 3 
emissions.
SUSTAINABILITY INTEGRATION IN SETIA
Keeping true to our vision, S P Setia’s development 
projects master plan aims for a holistic, green and 
sustainable urban development that prioritises 
environmental conservation, community well-being 
and long-term sustainability. We engage in catalytic 
strategic partnerships  for our commercial land 
transactions to unlock value and accelerate holistic 
development execution, spurring long-term growth 
in key areas and benefitting the community at large. 
An example of this value-creation effort is the sale 
of our 18-acre freehold land in Setia City to KSL 
Bestari Sdn Bhd in November 2023. We believe that 
creating synergies with the right strategic partners 
with the right skills is the way forward in creating 
sustainable communities.
Another key milestone for S P Setia in 2023 was 
the signing of the JV agreement with Mitsui 
Fudosan for the Setia Federal Hill development  in 
Jalan Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur. This development, 
valued at an estimated GDV of RM1.4 billion, 
kickstarts Setia Federal Hill’s journey towards 
becoming a self-sustaining mini metropolis. The JV 
between S P Setia and Mitsui Fudosan represents 
a synergistic partnership that combines local 
expertise with international best practices to realise 
a transformative vision for Setia Federal Hill and 
elevate Kuala Lumpur into a world-class sustainable 
city of the future.
The project’s strategic location in Jalan Bangsar, 
Kuala Lumpur, positions it as a key catalyst for 
economic growth, urban revitalisation and cultural 
enrichment in the heart of the city. By catalysing 
investment, job creation and tourism, Setia Federal 
Hill has the potential to contribute significantly to 
Kuala Lumpur’s status as a global city and enhance 
its competitiveness on the world stage.
On the international frontier, our recent RM220  
million land acquisition in St. Leonards, Sydney, 
Australia, during the year demonstrates the 
Company’s commitment to furthering its global 
footprint, following its successful presence in 
Melbourne. This paves the way for future revenue 
growth pipeline for the Group . St. Leonards, 
located in the North Shore area of Sydney, is known 
for its strategic positioning and vibrant economic 
activity. Being a part of this dynamic region presents 
numerous opportunities for S P Setia to capitalise 
on the robust real estate market, add value to the 
local community, contribute to the city’s urban 
landscape and meet the growing demand for 
quality developments in Sydney.
We are pleased to report yet another year 
of solid achievement, as our 2023 sales hit 
the RM5 billion mark; a significant 24% 
improvement from 2022 levels. It  
underscores the strength and resilience of 
the market fundamentals and reflects the 
value creation achieved through collaboration 
of various stakeholders across the industry, 
underpinned by the dedicated support from 
Team Setia. As a leading player in the 
property market, S P Setia is well positioned 
to capitalise on the improving market 
conditions. The resurgence in demand for 
residential, commercial and industrial 
properties presents exciting opportunities for 
us to expand our portfolio, unlock new 
revenue streams and deliver value to our 
shareholders. Meanwhile, our resilient balance 
sheet, diversified asset base and strategic 
partnerships position us favourably to 
capitalise on emerging trends and drive 
sustainable growth in the long term.
Despite the challenging economic condition 
in Malaysia and the global macroeconomic 
environment and market headwinds, the 
Group remains vigilant in balancing its capital 
structure and effectively managing its 
de-gearing programme in pursuit of a 
sustainable overall performance.
UNLOCKING VALUE THROUGH 
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
S P Setia adopts a forward-thinking approach 
in formulating strategies to seize opportunities 
for growth while navigating challenges in the 
business environment. Monetising non-
strategic land and divesting our non-core 
assets provides us with the liquidity capacity 
to invest in more strategic areas using the 
proceeds, thereby streamlining our operations 
and freeing up resources for growth initiatives. 
A major land disposal undertaken during the 
year involving Mah Sing Group Berhad in 
Glengowrie, Semenyih, Selangor, is expected 
to bolster this growth aspiration.
Our portfolio diversification  into industrial 
parks gained traction in 2023, with approximately 
900 acres of our land bank dedicated to this 
new segment. Spread across Malaysia in three 
strategic locations – Setia Alam (Klang), Tanjung 
Kupang (Johor) and Setia Fontaines (Bertam, 
Penang) – this move demonstrates our 
significant commitment to this sector. We 
recognise the high demand for industrial 
properties, signalling a lucrative opportunity in 
this market as we cater to businesses looking 
for manufacturing, warehousing or distribution 
facilities. Accordingly, we offer various amenities 
and infrastructure tailored to industrial needs, 
attracting companies seeking efficient and well-
equipped spaces for their operations. 
We are in the midst of negotiating international 
JV partnerships for our 399-acre Setia Alaman 
Industrial park development project, representing 
a significant step in expanding its reach and 
capabilities. Collaborating with international 
partners brings together diverse expertise, 
resources and new market access, enhancing 
the success and competitiveness of S P Setia 
as a rising player in industrial park development. 
By partnering with established companies or 
investors from different regions, Setia Alaman 
Industrial Park can leverage its networks, 
experience and insights to navigate local 
regulations, cultural nuances and market 
dynamics more effectively. Additionally, the 
launch of the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 
(“NIMP 2030”) in October 2023 by the Malaysian 
government could present new opportunities 
for collaboration, funding and cross-market 
access, while also ensuring alignment with 
national development priorities and regulatory 
frameworks.

Engagement and nurture agile mindset, preparing 
our people for the future of work and steering our 
business transformation. Through unconventional 
corporate experiential learning under the theme of 
“Thriving as One”, we actively engage our people of 
all levels in this learning journey.
ADVANCING DIVERSITY, EQUITY & 
INCLUSION
We value and honour gender equality and diversity. 
The Women of Inspiration (“WIN”) initiative, founded 
in 2017, organises various programmes and events 
year-round to foster constructive discussions on 
the hurdles and prospects encountered by women 
in professional settings. In 2023, WIN curated a 
series of events commemorating International 
Women’s Day, centred on the theme “Embracing 
Equity”. The lineup included stories highlighting the 
contributions of female leaders, employees and 
emerging talent within our organisation. Additionally, 
there was a lively Purple & Pink Day encouraging 
all staff to demonstrate solidarity. Moreover, 
EmpowHER, a two-hour gathering accessible to 
employees and Business Associates, honoured 
women’s accomplishments and underscored our 
dedication to fostering gender equity in the 
workplace. S P Setia also demonstrated its 
commitment to creating an inclusive and equitable 
workplace by granting a half day off for all women 
during the month of March. This was to acknowledge 
the dual roles women play in striving for workplace 
equality and fulfilling caregiving responsibilities. 
UPHOLDING LABOUR RIGHTS
Delivering our commitment to fair employment 
practices, our Labour Rights Policy was enacted on 
1 July 2023 in accordance with the framework set 
forth by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (“PNB”). The 
policy encompasses six key material issues: Forced 
and Child Labour, Rights to Freedom of Association, 
Fair Wages and Benefits, Diversity and Inclusion, 
Safety and Health, and Upskilling and Education. For 
each of these areas, the policy establishes specific 
commitments and standards that we hold ourselves, 
our employees and our Business Associates 
accountable to. This empowers us to maintain 
consistency in employment practices across our 
business operations and to strictly comply with the 
existing laws and regulations in the countries where 
we operate. 
INNOVATION: THE DRIVING FORCE OF SUSTAINABILITY
The Board Sustainability Committee and the Management Sustainability 
Committee oversee our innovation strategy, setting focus areas and key 
performance indicator (“KPI”) targets for innovation that are reviewed quarterly. 
We accomplished this goal by implementing nine innovative features launched 
through Setia eGreenLiving as part of our product offering. These features 
comprise a set of smart and sustainable home elements which will be rolled 
out across all of our upcoming developments. We also introduced the Customer 
Experience Center Plus (“CEC+”) portal, which combines customer data from 
various systems into one platform, allowing our Setia Ambassadors to respond 
to customer inquiries more quickly. Additionally, in implementing renewable 
energy solutions, our collaboration with Tenaga Nasional Berhad, inked in 2022, 
has been pushed full steam ahead throughout 2023 to drive the adoption of 
green technology across our developments via solar water heating systems 
and solar panels installations for on-site renewable energy generation at our 
properties. 
DIGITAL SUSTAINABILITY & INNOVATION CULTURE
To stay ahead, we focus on fostering an innovation culture throughout the 
Group, from idea to execution. We have made big strides by digitalising our 
key processes, adopting cutting-edge digital marketing and improving the 
efficiency of our construction methods. Apart from the Innovation Team, we 
have a dedicated Digital Sustainability team focused on implementing digital 
solutions to drive digital sustainability, a crucial part of our sustainability 
efforts. In 2023, their accomplishments included finding a fitting ESG data 
platform called “eDew” and investigating the potential of Artificial Intelligence 
(“AI”), data analytics and Internet of Things (“IoT’) for environmental monitoring 
and other sustainability tasks.
ROADMAP TO TCFD ADOPTION
In 2023, we embraced the Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)  
recommendations. This encompassed identifying 
pivotal climate change risks and opportunities, 
instituting a governance framework to oversee 
them, crafting strategies for climate action and 
defining essential metrics and targets to steer our 
advancement. We looked at how climate change 
might impact our Group’s risks and opportunities, 
leading to six focus areas where we have developed 
mitigation plans. By linking emissions reduction with 
our business strategy through TCFD, we are striving 
for a more unified approach to climate action that 
aligns with our planet’s protection. These identified 
risks and opportunities will heavily influence our 
Group-level strategies going forward, enabling 
better decision-making about our business future 
amid climate change. As we continue our 
sustainability reporting journey, our goal is to attain 
complete adherence to the TCFD recommendations 
by 2025.
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT & 
DEVELOPMENT
The Annual People Pulse Survey was carried out to 
understand the sentiment of our people on the 
ground as a foundation of our people’s strategy in 
shaping an employee-centric organisation. We also 
launched a refreshed vision and mission, integral to 
our business transformation, charting a new direction 
for the company. Vision-Mission roadshows were 
run across the Group to ensure seamless alignment 
among Team Setia in embracing this new direction. 
We are dedicated in strengthening our Team 
In 2023, we launched “Sincerely, Setia” as S P Setia Foundation’s (“SPSF”) 
flagship programme initiative, aimed at spreading kindness and supporting 
underserved Malaysians. This initiative embodies the spirit of generosity 
and selflessness, underscoring our commitment to making a difference. 
It focuses on four core areas: Disaster Relief, Community and Health, 
Education, and Unity. Additionally, we continued to expand the Setia 
Caring School Programme, which has been our primary initiative since 
2015. This programme strives to narrow educational disparities among 
underserved populations, providing equitable opportunities to bottom 
40 income (“B40”) and disabled students through tailored educational 
assistance and collaborative community initiatives. In 2023, the 
programme made a difference for 1,270 students from 12 schools 
across Selangor, Penang and Johor.

AWARDS & RECOGNITION
Building developments that resonate with the needs and demands of our 
customers, either locally or on the international front, is a testament to 
our understanding of diverse markets and our ability to adapt to evolving 
preferences. Internationally, we were honoured at the FIABCI World Prix 
d’Excellence Awards 2023 held in Miami, Florida, United States of America 
(“USA”), by winning two World Gold awards through the outstanding 
deliveries of our Setia Eco Templer, Rawang (Landscape Master Plan 
category) and Setia V Residences, Penang (Residential High Rise category) 
projects.
Winning prestigious awards on the international stage certainly speaks 
volumes about the quality and appeal of our products. It is not just about 
recognition; it is a validation of our commitment to excellence and our 
ability to resonate with the needs and desires of our customers and 
communities. 
In Malaysia, S P Setia once again was honoured as one of the top three 
property developers at The Edge Malaysia Property Excellence Awards 
2023. Achieving the top position in this award for 14 years has been a 
testament to our sustained excellence over nearly two decades. This 
milestone not only reflects our past successes but also inspires us to 
continue innovating and striving for excellence in the years to come.
2023 had also marked a significant milestone for

2023 was awarded the Best Corporate Sukuk 
Wakalah of the Year Award from Alpha Southeast

agency in Asia. Sharing the stage with reputable 
institutions and companies from across the region 
further solidifies S P Setia’s position as a leader

OFFICER’S
REVIEW
As we delve into the details of our 
performance and strategic initiatives, 
I invite you to celebrate our successes, 
learn from our experiences and 
envision the exciting opportunities 
that lie ahead. Together, we are 
shaping the future of S P Setia and 
making a meaningful impact in 
becoming the leader in creating 
sustainable communities and 
enriching lifestyles.
 2023 IN A NUTSHELL
Sales Achievement  S P Setia has reached a 
significant milestone by surpassing the RM5 billion mark in 
sales, a significant 24% improvement from 2022 levels. This 
accomplishment showcases S P Setia’s strong market 
presence and ability to meet consumer demand.
Regional Growth  We acquired a new piece of prime land 
in Sydney, Australia, in 2023, marking our regional expansion 
in the Australian market. By capitalising on opportunities in 
this regions, Setia strengthens its future revenue pipeline and 
enhances its global presence.
REIT-able Investment Properties  Our investment  
properties provide us with the platform to monetise our 
investment assets for future recurring income streams, 
providing stability and long-term value for investors in the 
long run. 
Land Bank Strategy  Our strategic land bank management 
focuses on unlocking value and monetising non-core land 
bank to generate cashflow, accelerate catalytic development 
opportunities and foster collaboration with strategic partners. 
This approach enables us to capture the strategic value of 
our land bank more effectively and efficiently.
Township Development Excellence  We continue to excel 
in township development, which is our niche expertise. This 
sustained success highlights our commitment to creating 
vibrant and sustainable communities that meet the needs 
of modern living.
JV, Collaboration & Synergy  S P Setia emphasises 
collaboration and synergy across its operations, leveraging 
partnerships to drive innovation and efficiency. By integrating 
collaboration in our various business segments, we leverage 
on cross-industries skills and expertise and enhance our 
competitive advantage for sustainable growth. The JV signed 
with Mitsui Fudosan in December 2023 for the Setia Federal 
Hill, Jalan Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur development project is a 
strong testament to this.
Diversification into Industrial Parks  We have diversified 
our product line by expanding into world-class industrial 
parks development in Setia Alaman, Tanjung Kupang and 
Setia Fontaines. This expansion allows the Company to tap 
into new markets and cater to the growing demand for 
industrial real estate, further diversifying our revenue streams 
in the long run.
De-gearing Programme & Capital Allocation Discipline
We have implemented a strategic de-gearing programme and 
maintained strict discipline in optimising capital allocations. 
This ensures efficient use of resources and strengthens our 
financial position for future growth and stability. Our borrowings 
has reduced significantly over the past two years – by almost 
RM2.4  billion from land bank monetisation efforts.
Setia Green Roadmap, Sustainability & Digitalisation
The Setia Green Roadmap outlines our objectives for climate 
action and metrics for mitigating climate-related risks. Our 
commitment is to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with 
interim goals of reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 45% 
by 2030 and 70% by 2040. Additionally, we are in the 
process of completing our baseline assessment and setting 
interim targets for Scope 3 emissions. Setia is committed 
to sustainability and innovation in all aspects of its business. 
From green building practices to innovative design solutions, 
Setia strives to create developments that are environmentally 
responsible and future-proof.

MM2H relaxation
• Driving foreign property investments  and 
alleviating the property overhang in key regions.
• Attracting more foreign investors and retirees
to Malaysia as they may find the visa 
requirements more favourable. This influx of 
foreign buyers can stimulate demand for 
properties, particularly in popular expatriate or 
retirement destinations where S P Setia’s 
properties are located (i.e Kuala Lumpur, Penang 
and Johor).
• Attracting affluent expatriates and retirees
seeking high-quality properties and lifestyle 
amenities with luxury developments tailored to 
their preferences. These properties may offer 
premium features such as waterfront location 
and golf courses.
• Capitalising on MM2H participants’ interest in 
long-term investment opportunities, whether 
for retirement or as a second home, by offering 
properties that are suitable for long-term 
investment, such as residential developments 
with the potential for capital appreciation or 
rental income.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT & MACRO TRENDS
The Malaysian residential property market has demonstrated resilience despite 
economic challenges, with notable increases in asking prices and the sale price 
index. Infrastructure developments, especially in Johor, have positively impacted 
the market, while government policy changes may further boost growth. The 
rental market saw a rebound in demand, possibly driven by rising costs pushing 
buyers towards renting. However, constraints on price increases persist due 
to weak demand and increased property listings. Malaysia experienced a 3.7% 
year-on-year economic growth in 2023, as housing demand remained stable, 
with an increasing shift towards the rental market.
Malaysia’s gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew by 3.7% year-on-year, as the 
continued recovery in economic activity and labour market conditions 
supported growth in 2023. In addition, the solid growth performance of the 
economy was reinforced by a resilient external position. However, growth 
moderated from the previous year amid a challenging external environment 
mainly due to slower global trade, the global tech downcycle, geopolitical 
tensions and tighter monetary policies. Bank Negara Malaysia anticipates a 
steady growth rate of 4% to 5% in 2024. In 2023, headline inflation decreased 
to 2.5%, down from 3.3% in 2022. Geopolitical tensions led to increased oil 
prices and subsequently higher inflation, whereas slowed growth helped stabilise 
commodity prices. Consequently, the Overnight Policy Rate (“OPR”) was 
maintained at 3% in November 2023 for the third consecutive time.
Malaysia’s Budget 2024 announcement is 
anticipated to bring positive outcomes to the 
property sector, driven by government 
initiatives to enhance homeownership and 
advancements in major infrastructure projects. 
Key highlights include the government’s 
control of the Bandar Malaysia project, 
favourable developments in Iskandar Malaysia 
and planned relaxations in the Malaysia My 
Second Home (“MM2H”) programme criteria. 
The designation of 2026 as “Visit Malaysia 
Year” and an allocation of RM350 million for 
tourism could also positively impact the 
property market. Additionally, a RM20 million 
fund has been allocated to Think City to 
revitalise downtown Kuala Lumpur into a 
dynamic creative hub. 
Despite uncertain economic conditions and 
high interest rates, potential buyers are likely 
to proceed cautiously. However, this caution 
has not resulted in an economic downturn, 
leaving property owners reluctant to lower 
their asking prices. The market is expected 
to maintain stability, although there is a 
noticeable trend towards rental properties as 
property seekers seek alternatives in the 
current environment.
Malaysia’s GDP grew 
by 3.7% year-on-
year, as the 
continued recovery 
in economic activity 
and labour market 
conditions supported 
growth in 2023
GOVERNMENT POLICIES SHAPING OUR 
STRATEGY
Government policies play a pivotal role in shaping 
our strategies and business decisions. We align our 
product development, marketing strategies and 
market positioning to leverage the opportunities 
created by these policies. This proactive approach 
enables us to capitalise on government initiatives, 
leading to increased demand for our properties and 
ultimately driving higher profits.
Stamp duty exemption (first time home-buyers; 
≤RM500k): 
• Shifting our marketing and development focus 
towards properties that cater to first-time 
homebuyers, offering affordable prices that fall 
within the eligible price range for the stamp 
duty exemption. 
• Positioning ourselves as supportive partners in 
customers’ homebuying journey.
Bank Negara 
Malaysia anticipates 
a steady growth 
rate of 4% to 5% in 
2024. In 2023, 
headline inflation 
decreased to 2.5%, 
down from 3.3% in 
2022
HCGS
• Increased Access to Financing: HCGS aims to enhance access to housing 
financing for eligible borrowers, particularly first-time homebuyers and those 
with limited financial resources. It reduces the risk for lenders, making it 
easier for individuals to qualify for housing loans. This increased access to 
financing can expand the pool of potential homebuyers, stimulating demand. 
• Stimulated Demand: The availability of housing loans under the HCGS can 
stimulate demand for properties across various market segments. Setia may 
benefit from increased sales and a broader customer base as more 
individuals are able to afford homes with the assistance of the scheme. 
This can lead to higher occupancy rates for residential developments and 
improved absorption rates for new housing projects.
• Reduced Default Risk:  The guarantee provided by the HCGS mitigates the 
risk of default for lenders, as a portion of the outstanding loan amount is 
secured by the scheme. This reduced default risk can encourage financial 
institutions to extend housing loans to a broader range of borrowers, 
including those with lower credit profiles or smaller down payments. S P 
Setia may benefit from a more stable and liquid housing market, with fewer 
disruptions due to loan defaults or foreclosures.
The launch of Malaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (“NIMP”) and National 
Energy Transition Roadmap (“NETR”) in 2023 presents a favourable environment 
for S P Setia and other industry players to thrive while contributing to the 
country’s economic growth and environmental sustainability goals. Collaborating 
with the government and other stakeholders, securing funding and strategically 
aligning with national priorities will be key to leveraging these opportunities 
effectively.

INVEST FOR VALUE, DIVEST FOR VALUE
In 2023, we embarked on a few significant investment and divestment initiatives with the objective of creating value for S P Se tia.
Our core strength in landed property development, particularly township development, is still the pulse of our business. Having  
excelled in this segment thus far, we are taking it up a notch by turning it “green”, integrating it with Setia Green Roadmap s trategy. 
We have big plans for sustainability, with ambitious carbon reduction targets between now and 2050. Our landed properties and 
townships provide us a wide range of avenues to implement our sustainability goals effectively, together with the community.
Our venture into the healthcare sector through a JV with Qualitas Medical Group has been progressing well, with the first ambul atory 
care centre in Setia City Residence, Setia Alam, scheduled to open in Q1 2024. Our new hotels, Amari Kuala Lumpur (252 rooms) 
located in the heart of our Setia KL Eco City integrated development, and Amari SPICE Penang (453 rooms) located in Bayan Lepas, 
Penang, are operating at full capacity with growing demand, particularly from the business travellers market since their offici al opening 
late last year. Amari Kuala Lumpur has been named the winner of the Luxury Lifestyle Award for Best Luxury City Hotel in Malays ia 
for 2023. Recognised as one of the most prestigious awards in the luxury hospitality industry, the hotel was praised for its lu xurious 
facilities, excellent service and its commitment to providing guests with a memorable experience.
• Industrial Park Development:  We have a total of about 942 acres of land bank carved out for industrial development, with 
a total estimated GDV of over RM6 billion, spread across three strategic locations in the Central, Southern and Northern 
regions, that are progressing steadily. In the Central region, our 399-acre Setia Alaman Industrial Park in Klang is the most 
advanced so far, located in the mature township of Bukit Raja, Klang – Shah Alam area. It is equipped with world-class 
infrastructure and access roads, with strategic connectivity. With an estimated GDV of RM3 billion, we are now in active 
JV negotiations with a number of international partners serving the light to medium industries. In the Johor region, state 
approval was obtained in September 2023 for our Tanjung Kupang site, a 307-acre land near Tanjung Pelepas carrying an 
estimated GDV of RM1.4 billion. Whereas up north in Setia Fontaines, Penang, we are planning to rezone 323 acres out 
of the 1,691 acres for industrial use, with an estimated GDV of RM1.6 billion. These industrial parks are expected to bring 
in a consistent revenue for Setia for the next five to eight years.
 Key Investments in 2023
2023 KEY PERFORMANCE 
HIGHLIGHTS
• Financially: We recorded a robust level 
of sales as we surpassed the RM5 billion 
mark, significantly reduced our 
borrowings and monetised our land bank 
• Operationally:  We completed and 
delivered projects worth RM7.86 billion, 
made industrial expansion progress in 
Setia Alaman Industrial Park, signed the 
Setia Federal Hill development project 
JV agreement with Mitsui Fudosan, 
completed a land acquisition in Sydney 
and continued our regional growth 
expansion in Australia and Vietnam
• Sustainability, Digitalisation &
Innovation: We set our emissions targets 
through the Setia Green Roadmap, 
launched Setia eGreenLiving, embarked 
on digital transformation and  
incorporated solar solutions in our 
products
In the midst of this dynamic landscape, we 
remained steadfast in pursuing our strategic 
objectives to enhance our competitive edge. 
We efficiently expedited the development of 
both our townships and standalone projects 
to unleash the potential of our land bank, 
which currently spans 6,311 acres, with a 
remaining effective GDV of RM119.74 billion.
Our adept understanding of our customers’ 
lifestyle preferences proved invaluable, 
particularly in a post-COVID-19-pandemic 
era where the demand for space was on the 
rise. S P Setia surpassed its FY2023 sales 
target of RM4.20 billion, achieving 
RM5.1  billion in sales, a notable 21% above 
target.
Meanwhile, our unbilled sales amounted to 
RM5.64  billion. We successfully introduced 
2,677 new units for sale, totalling RM3.56 
billion in GDV, with promising uptake rates.
Through diligent execution, the value of 
completed and delivered projects during the 
year amounted to RM7.86 billion worth of 
properties. Of this total, 71% originated from 
our local projects, while the remaining 29% 
stemmed from our international ventures.
OUR REVENUE GROWTH DRIVERS
The strength of our revenue growth this year is attributable to a number of key drivers, 
including land bank monetisation transactions through catalytic development land sales, 
higher revenue contributions received from Australia as projects reached completion 
(UNO Melbourne and Sapphire by the Gardens Shangri-La hotel), 100% take-up rates 
for launches of residential landed properties in Central and Southern region mature 
townships, income from investment properties (hotels, retail malls and convention 
centres), as well as the clearance of completed inventories during the year. 
In line with our business plan, we continue to gain headways in reducing our debt 
level and gearing. Although borrowings level have reduced, the normalisation of 
interest rates continues to keep interest costs high, which impacts our profit. Interest 
costs have been on an increasing trend due to interest rate normalisation post-
pandemic. Income from land monetisation will help push our profitability stronger. 
Hence, it is imperative to accelerate our income base to generate sustainable levels 
of cash flow to pare down our borrowings and lower the impact of finance costs.
20 Atchison Street is strategically located in the thriving neighbourhood of St. Leonards, 
enhancing the S P Setia brand in Australia
• Sold 500 acres of non-core land 
in Glengowrie, Semenyih,
Selangor, to Mah Sing Group 
Berhad for RM392.04 million.
• Sold 18 acres of freehold land in 
Setia Alam to KSL Bestari Sdn Bhd
for RM228.80 million for catalytic 
development acceleration.
 Key Divestments in 2023
• Setia Federal Hill JV: In December 2023, S P Setia entered into a JV agreement 
with Mitsui Fudosan to develop two parcels of commercial land, spanning 
2.67 acres in Setia Federal Hill, Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur. This development, 
valued at an estimated GDV of RM1.4 billion, will consist of two residential 
towers. This move kickstarts Setia Federal Hill’s journey towards becoming a 
self-sustaining mini metropolis, with an aspiration of elevating Kuala Lumpur 
into a world-class sustainable city of the future.
• Sydney Land Acquistion/Australia Growth: Expanding our global presence 
and existing footprint in Melbourne, S P Setia made its inaugural foray into 
Sydney, Australia, in 2023 with a RM220 million land acquisition at 20 Atchison 
Street in St. Leonards. Strategically positioned in North Shore, the land is 
planned for residential high-rise development with an estimated GDV of 
AUD236 million (approximately RM708 million).

OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Looking ahead, we must remain vigilant and adaptable as the business environment continues to evolve rapidly. While we celebrat e 
our achievements, we must also recognise that there are still opportunities for improvement and innovation. By staying true to our 
core values and leveraging our strengths, we are confident that we will continue to thrive in the years to come.
OUR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY
Demonstrating our commitment to embracing digitalisation and innovation with sustainability integration, we expanded our Group Digital 
team in September 2023 to comprise four units: Digital Operations, Digital & Analytics, Digital Sustainability and Innovation.
A three-pronged approach is applied to implementing our Digital Optimisation Strategy:
We take proactive measures to enhance cyber resilience in S P Setia, addressing risks of data loss and cyber threats through di gital 
initiatives on cybersecurity training and user awareness, IT security governance and cybersecurity hardening. Mandatory cyberse curity 
training and user awareness initiatives are conducted on a regular basis for all of our employees at all levels to mitigate the  risks of 
human error, a significant factor in cybersecurity breaches. Our robust IT security governance ensures that policies and proced ures 
are in place to mitigate the risks effectively. We have also rolled out cybersecurity hardening by implementing measures to str engthen 
the security posture of our systems and infrastructure, thereby reducing vulnerabilities to cyber threats.
Debt Reduction, Optimal Capital Structure
We aim to maintain an optimal balance between debt levels 
and capital allocation for growth. This includes divesting 
non-core assets, refinancing borrowings at lower interest 
rates and generating more cash flow to service our debt 
obligations. The goal is to improve financial stability and 
flexibility by reducing the burden of finance costs that erode 
our value creation. 
Strengthen Investment Properties for Recurring Income
Through our range of investment properties in the various 
sectors (hotels, malls, convention centres, office buildings 
and schools), we focus on optimising the value of these 
assets to generate stable, recurring income streams. 
Implementing effective asset management strategies such 
as leasing optimisation, property refurbishment or 
redevelopment, and portfolio diversification, we are 
strengthening the assets’ long term value for real estate 
investment trust (“REIT”) potential in order to provide our 
investors with access to income-generating properties while 
also potentially unlocking value for S P Setia Group.
Accelerate Development and Land Monetisation: 
We strive to maximise the value of our land bank through 
efficient land bank management and development projects 
to organically grow our sales. Our Setia Alaman Industrial 
park development, strategic land bank monetisation efforts, 
regional expansion in Australia and Vietnam, Setia Federal 
Hill development project and ongoing residential and 
commercial development throughout our business presence 
globally are among the key avenues to unlock potential 
value for revenue growth.
Sustainability, Digitalisation and Innovation
By combining sustainability, digitalisation and innovation 
integration throughout our business, we are creating a 
compelling value proposition that resonates with our 
customers, drives growth and strengthens our competitive 
positioning in the market.
Intensify Sales & 
Marketing:
Through marketing automation, 
we enhance lead tracking, set 
up a centralised database for 
all client interactions and 
boost traffic via digital 
channels (website and mobile 
app). We also leverage data 
analytics to track and analyse 
campaigns and gather  
homebuyers’ insights, helping 
us in profiling buyers’ persona 
and segmentation and making 
data-driven decisions.
Inttensify
 Elevate Operation 
Excellence:
Our operational efficiency 
is enhanced through 
information technology 
(“IT”) infrastructure and 
system optimisation and 
digital workspace  
adoption, including AI-
assisted workspace.
ElElevate
Innovate The Future:
We unlock new digital opportunities through our 
SOTG mobile app for customer engagement and 
retention as well as potential data monetisation. We 
also engage in digital partnerships, such as the 
National Technology & Innovation Sandbox 
programme, to work with innovative startups, SOTG 
strategic partners and solar market players in 
developing electric vehicle (“EV”) solar charging hubs 
at our Welcome Centres. Emerging technology such 
as MarTech enables us to elevate our marketing with 
marketing technologies such as CRM, CDP and CMS, 
while the AI-Chatbot technology provides us with 
the “always-on” virtual sales and customer service.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
As we conclude our review of our financial performance for 2023, I would like to express my gratitude to each and every member 
of Team Setia for their unwavering dedication and passion. It is your hard work and commitment that have propelled us to where 
we are today, and I have no doubt that together, we will accomplish even greater things in the future.
Thank you for your continued excellence, and here is to another year of success and growth. 
Best wishes.

Greater Value Creation in 2023
Bolstered by resurgent demand for property in Malaysia, we hit our target of RM4.2 billion in annual sales for 2023, creating 
greater value for our stakeholders and the economy. During the past year, we launched a total of 41 phases of projects, 
comprising 2,616 residential and commercial units, totalling to a gross development value (“GDV”) of RM2.93 billion.
INNOVATION
Innovation is a key facet of our DNA at Setia. By continuously seeking ways to improve our product offerings and customer servi ce 
standards, we are able to retain our reputation as a progressive, market-leading property developer and achieve our growth obje ctives. 
Innovation to us also means achieving technical excellence by finding more cost, time and resource-efficient ways to develop ou r 
properties and deliver excellent services, often through the implementation of cutting-edge digital solutions.
Our Performance

Strengthening Our Approach to Innovation
In 2023, we set key performance indicators (“KPIs”) 
for innovation and established a dedicated 
Innovation Unit to empower continuous Group-
wide innovation efforts across our products and 
services.
Our approach to innovation is overseen by our 
Management Sustainability Committee and Board 
Sustainability Committee, who set focus areas and 
innovation targets, reviewing our innovation 
performance against these targets on a quarterly 
basis. In 2023, we set a KPI of implementing at 
least two innovative ideas for our product offerings 
and one innovative idea for customer service. We 
achieved this target through the introduction of 
nine innovative features under Setia eGreenLiving 
and the launch of our Customer Experience Center 
Plus (“CEC+”) portal to empower our frontliners to 
deliver better customer service.
Embedding Innovation Within Our Business
To remain ahead of the curve, we strive to nurture a culture of innovation 
across all our Business Units and processes – from the conceptualisation of 
our developments to their construction and our marketing and sales strategies. 
In recent years, we have made significant progress on this journey by digitalising 
key processes, adopting advanced digital marketing solutions and introducing 
more efficient construction techniques, amongst other achievements.
A dedicated Innovation Team was established in 2023 to be responsible for 
accelerating the ideation and implementation of new products and services 
across the Group. The team works closely with all Business Units to create 
the ideal conditions for innovative thinking to flourish, fostering integrated, 
broad-view thinking to envision the focal points of our efforts.
In addition to the Innovation Team, our Digital Sustainability team focuses 
specifically on introducing new digital solutions to drive sustainability, addressing 
an important aspect of our sustainability agenda. In 2023, their achievements 
included identifying a suitable ESG data collection and reporting platform – 
called “eDew” – and exploring the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), data 
analytics and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) for environmental monitoring and 
other sustainability-related purposes.
As a leading property developer with a growing local and international presence, 
we have the opportunity to create signiﬁcant value for economies, people and the 
environment. By managing our business responsibly, driving innovation and 
pursuing quality at every turn, we can maximise our impact.
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Through our property development and property-related business, we generate significant economic value that is distributed 
through the taxes we pay, employee salaries and benefits we provide, dividends we issue and community programmes 
we support – collectively benefitting the economies of Malaysia and our other countries of operation.

In 2023, we took a big step forward with the launch of Setia 
eGreenLiving, a collection of smart home features grounded in 
sustainability which we will roll out across our upcoming 
developments. Features incorporated within eGreenLiving include:
– Smart Home System:  A system that enables residents to 
control multiple switches and power plugs via a mobile app
– Smart Lock:  Locks which can be controlled remotely and 
unlocked using fingerprint scanning, card, password and 
physical key
– Solar Panel:  Pre-installed solar photovoltaic panels for 
residents to power their homes with renewable energy
– Solar Switch:  Infrastructure that enables residents to easily 
install solar photovoltaic panels and power their homes with 
renewable energy
– Rainwater Harvesting System:  A designated tank to harvest 
rainwater, connected to an outdoor tap for plant watering, 
car washing and other purposes
– EV Port:  An electrical connector which residents can use to 
charge their electric vehicle
– Box 366: A drop box that can be used for contactless delivery 
of food and parcels
– Air Management System: A system to improve ventilation and 
indoor air quality
– Green Switch:  a master switch which residents can use to 
activate or deactivate all lights instantly
Driving Efficiencies in Construction
Health
Building communities that are 
surrounding by greenery and water 
and air features to promote healthy 
lifestyles
Community
Providing spaces, such as clubhouses, 
where customers can connect and 
build stronger community bonds
Safety
Prioritising the safety of residents by 
introducing advanced security 
technologies such as smart locks
Mobility
Introducing features such as public 
transport access, walkways and quality 
roads to provide our customers with a 
variety of transportation options
Green Energy
Enabling residents to reduce their 
emissions by making our properties 
solar ready while supporting the use 
of electric vehicles (“EV”) through 
installation of EV chargers
Water
Integrating natural features such as 
water fountains and lakes to bring 
residents closer to nature and enhance 
quality of life
To meet our high quality standards and drive cost and time-
efficiencies in construction, we have adopted the Industrialised 
Building System (“IBS”) construction technique, whereby 
components are precast in an offsite environment before being 
transported and assembled at the project site. 
Through our use of IBS, we have been able to achieve greater 
precision across our construction processes. This has enabled us 
to shorten delivery timeframes, reduce waste of materials and 
enhance the quality of our developments, all at reduced cost.
Improving Customer Service
To empower better customer service standards amongst our 
employees, we launched CEC+ in 2023. CEC+ amalgamates 
customer data points from multiple systems into a single platform, 
providing visibility of all customer enquiries in real-time. This 
facilitates faster responses to customer enquiries by our dedicated 
team of Setia Ambassadors.
Maintaining High Quality Standards
In accelerating innovation across our operations, we are steered 
by the core principle of maintaining excellence in quality, in 
compliance with the standards of SIRIM ISO 9001:2015 Quality 
Management System.
Our approach is guided by in the Quality Assessment System in 
Construction (“QLASSIC”) framework, which provides a benchmark 
for our project teams in attaining the workmanship standards set 
by the Construction Industry Development Board (“CIDB”). Guided 
by the framework, we consistently monitor workmanship across 
our project sites while upholding stringent quality control 
measures.
Adding a further level of control to our quality management 
processes, our Group Quality Management (“GQM”) team monitors 
product quality performance through regular In-process 
Construction Quality (“ICQ”) audits and Construction Performance 
Assessments (“CPA”). The ICQ audit, conducted bi-monthly, 
meticulously evaluates the quality of projects in the construction 
phase. The CPA, meanwhile, evaluates the quality of architectural 
work at completed projects, with contractors required to attain 
a minimum score of 75%. Both evaluations are fully aligned with 
our Quality Standard and project-specific specifications, ensuring 
consistent delivery of projects that meet or exceed our quality 
levels.
In 2023, our property developments achieved an average ICQ 
score of 78.4% and an average CPA score of 76.7%.
 PROCUREMENT PRACTICES
We work with a wide variety of suppliers across our operations. These companies play a pivotal role in ensuring timely delivery  of 
our products and services to high standards. As such, we maintain rigorous procurement practices geared towards selecting compa nies 
that meet our quality expectations and our standards in social and environmental management.
Supporting the Local Business Ecosystem
Wherever possible, we choose to work with local suppliers, which is defined as suppliers whose businesses are registered in Mal aysia. 
Doing so creates a positive knock-on effect for the local business ecosystem as it leads to economic value that cascades to 
subcontractors and other businesses that serve our suppliers. It also delivers value to our business by driving cost and time savings, 
reducing our carbon footprint and promoting more effective supplier communication.
Maintaining a Sustainable Supply Chain
We have a responsibility to ensure that our sustainability commitments are met across our supply chain. To this end, we have 
embedded various social and environmental considerations into our supplier screening and evaluation processes.
As a basis, all third parties that we engage with, and their respective subcontractors, are required to adhere to our Code of C onduct 
and Business Ethics (“CoCBE”) when conducting all business activities related to the Group. The CoCBE specifically details the values 
that we expect all suppliers to uphold as well as our stance on issues related to human rights and conflicts of interest.
Further to this, all suppliers are expected to:
Adhere to all relevant regulatory requirements at the federal, state and municipal levels
Comply with industry standards in workmanship quality
Comply with all industry standards and best practices in minimising environmental and social impacts, including on Health, Safety 
and Environment (“HSE”) issues
Commit to practices that conserve the environment and minimise pollution, including noise, land and air pollution
Monitoring and Assessing Appointed Contractors
After a contractor is appointed, we carry out comprehensive monitoring and assessment processes to ensure that standards are 
adhered to across the project lifecycle. This includes monthly audits – conducted across all project sites – and a yearly Contr actor 
Performance Evaluation (“CPE”). HSE criteria, including supplier environmental and social impacts, form an important aspect of all 
evaluations.
In addition to these assessments, site visits are frequently conducted by Project Implemention Personnel for Pre-Qualification of New 
Contractors. Contractors are also required to submit monthly progress reports, aiding in our identification and rectification o f any 
issues that arise.
Building Smarter and More Sustainable Communities
In line with our purpose of Creating Sustainable Communities, we are introducing innovative approaches to property development 
which aim to enhance quality of life while minimising our impact on the environment.
Our efforts are encapsulated by Smart and Sustainable Developments (“SSD”), a Group-wide drive to leverage smart technologies 
that improve the wellbeing and safety of our customers, enable greater connectedness within our communities and reduce our use 
of natural resources, amongst other outcomes. SSD forms part of the Setia Technical Excellence Committee and is pillared on six 
areas of impact:

 MARKET PRESENCE
Across our business footprint, we ensure that 
our employment practices are in line with all 
federal, local and municipal laws and regulations. 
This includes the Employment Act 1974, to 
which we comply with the mandated minimum 
wage requirements of Malaysia. Further to this, 
entry wages for male and female employees are 
equal, as per our commitment to the values of 
fairness and equality.
To ensure that the employees of our contractors 
are compensated fairly, we provide remuneration 
that is in line with the type of work done and 
which, at all times, is in full compliance with the 
Minimum Wages Act of Malaysia.
Wherever possible, we recruit for Senior 
Management staff from within Malaysia. As of 
2023, 100% of our Senior Management consists 
of Malaysian citizens.
Our Performance
Note: All data presented below relates to our Malaysian operations only.

 CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Cognisant of the urgency of the climate crisis and its potential impacts – not 
only to the environment but to people, their communities and our business – we 
are taking a proactive approach to climate action by understanding our climate-
related risks and opportunities. 
Adopting the TCFD Recommendations
In 2023, we adopted the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). This involved identifying key risks and opportunities 
related to climate change, establishing a governance structure to manage these 
risks and opportunities, formulating climate action strategies and setting key metrics 
and targets to guide our progress. 
In identifying climate-related financial risks, we examined our Group-level risks 
and opportunities (see Managing Our Risks and Opportunities on page 127 for 
more) and discussed ways that climate change may affect our approach to each 
risk. This led to the identification of six areas of focus, under which we have 
formulated appropriate mitigation strategies. For a full disclosure of our strategies, 
please refer to “Adopting the TCFD Recommendations” on page 175.
 INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS
We are committed to furthering economic development in the 
communities where we operate while simultaneously striving to 
enhance social and environmental conditions. Our multifaceted 
contributions encompass investments in various environmental 
and social causes, driving job creation and bolstering national 
economic prosperity.
One of the primary ways we demonstrate our commitment is 
through investments in infrastructure and facilities for the benefit 
of local communities, with RM89.7 million allocated toward such 
endeavours at present. While some of these projects are ongoing, 
we are continuously refining and enhancing our approach to 
ensure maximum positive impact.
Our ongoing projects include the construction of essential 
infrastructure such as roads, schools and community centres. 
These significant investments not only provide immediate

employment opportunities but also create long-term benefits by 
improving access to vital services and fostering community

Additionally, our investments extend beyond physical infrastructure 
to encompass initiatives aimed at driving improved environmental 
stewardship and unlocking greater social welfare. To this end, 
we actively support environmental conservation efforts and 
community development programmes that empower individuals 
and foster inclusive growth, while also promoting the adoption 
of sustainable practices amongst our suppliers, communities and 
other stakeholders. 
Through our comprehensive approach to corporate social 
responsibility and sustainable business practices, we are dedicated 
to making a lasting difference in the communities we serve and 
contributing to a brighter and more prosperous future for all.

Our Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan
Supplementing the expectations detailed in our policies, our three-
year Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (“OACP”) for 2021-2023 
outlines seven key risk areas in anti-bribery and anti-corruption, 
with strategies and action plans developed under each.
The following initiatives were completed in 2023 under the OACP:
– Held a CEO/COO Dialogue and a talk by the Malaysia Anti-
Corruption Commission (“MACC”) on “How Business Associates
Can Assist to Prevent Bribery?”
– Implemented Conflict of Interest (“COI”) disclosure for our
employees and quarterly COI disclosures for our Key Senior 
Management (“KSM”), with the KSM disclosure aligned with 
the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia
– Implemented a gifts and hospitality online declaration in July 
2023
– Completed a compliance and assurance audit covering gifts, 
hospitality, donations and sponsorship transactions, carried 
out by our Group Internal Audit department 
– Enabled eligible Business Units to conduct a self-assessment 
on their corruption risks using an automated Excel spreadsheet 
and Microsoft SharePoint 
– Completed a review of key risk areas and conducted a
reassessment of corruption risks for targeted Business Units
– Undertook quarterly reporting of reviews of risk assessments, 
control measures and action plans to the Management Risk 
Team, RMC and Board
– Uploaded 17 materials via Integrity@Setia as part of our 
ongoing communications with employees on integrity, 
covering various topics of interest and IGU activities
Clear Whistleblowing Procedures
To encourage reporting of any actual or suspected incidents of 
bribery or corruption, we maintain a whistleblowing system that 
is accessible to all employees and Business Associates of the 
Group as well as residents of our developments and members 
of the public.
Reports can be made via the following channels, with all 
submissions kept confidential to protect the identity of the 
whistleblower and protect him or her from reprisals.
Whistleblowing Channels
– Whistleblowing e-Form
– Dedicated IGU line: 012-3020742 
(Monday – Friday, 9am – 5pm)
– Write in to the Chairman of RMC at 
jiv.sammanthan@spsetia.com or IGU
– Email IGU at igu@spsetia.com
– Walk-in/appointment with IGU or Chairman of RMC
In 2023, we received a total of 11 complaints via our whistleblowing 
channels. Two cases were related to allegations of improper 
conduct and were investigated by an internal team. These claims 
were investigated by our Group Human Resources (“GHR”) 
department, and substantiated findings indicated that they did 
not relate to corruption, and only disciplinary procedures were 
taken against proven cases. As such, this confirms that we had 
zero confirmed incidents of corruption during 2023. 
The other nine cases were related to customer complaints about 
our products or services. These cases were referred to the 
respective Business Units concerned or to corporate functions 
for their further action.
Policies and Procedures on Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption
We maintain a clear and comprehensive policy stance towards 
ethics and integrity, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption. 
Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy was established in 
accordance with Section 17A of the MACC Act (Amendment 
2018) on Corporate Liability. Alongside our Code of Conduct 
and Business Ethics (“CoCBE”), it forms the basis of our approach 
to anti-bribery and anti-corruption. To further strengthen our 
stance against bribery and corruption, all initiatives that fall under 
Adequate Procedures underlining TRUST principles are properly 
planned and implemented with consideration given to the 
standards outlined in the policy.
In addition to these core documents, policies pertaining to gifts, 
hospitality, donations, sponsorships and third-party relationships 
comprise an important facet of our efforts to prevent bribery 
and corruption. Our full suite of policies, which apply across our 
business – both in Malaysia and internationally – and our supplier 
relationships, comprises:

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR
To strengthen our stance against anti-competitive behaviour, we 
updated our Whistleblowing Policy in 2022, ensuring full alignment 
with ISO 37002:2021 Whistleblowing Management Systems. 
During 2023, we were involved in zero legal actions – either 
pending or completed – regarding anti-competitive behaviour 
or violations of anti-trust and monopoly legislation.
ANTI-CORRUPTION
We maintain a zero-tolerance stance towards all forms of 
corruption and bribery, cognisant that any instances of unethical 
business conduct may have an irreparable impact on the standing 
of our business in society and amongst our stakeholders.
Our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Framework
Our approach is guided by our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption 
Framework, which establishes a clear management structure as 
well as key roles and responsibilities for key members of our 
teams in combating corruption and bribery.
Our Integrity and Governance Unit (“IGU”) plays an important 
role within the framework by managing complaints and carrying 
out detection and verification activities, thus strengthening our 
integrity and governance functions. The unit comprises qualified 
Certified Integrity Officers and is headed by the Chief Risk, 
Integrity and Governance Officer and the Head of IGU. The unit 
reports directly to the Risk Management Committee, which 
directly answers to the Board.
Further to this, 39 Integrity and Governance Champions (“IGC”) 
have been appointed across our Business Units and corporate 
functions. They are tasked with building a culture of integrity 
within their area of the business, as guided by Group standards, 
thus ensuring that awareness and action on anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption matters extend across the Group.

Awareness and Training on Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption
In order to drive consistent and continuous adherence to our 
standards, all employees and business associates of the Group 
are made aware of our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies 
and procedures through training programmes and events.
As one of S P Setia’s core procedures, all new employees of the 
Group are required to attend training on our CoCBE as well as 
other anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies as part of their 
onboarding programme. New arrivals must also sign our Individual 
Corruption-Free Pledge, which commits them to upholding our 
standards in all activities undertaken as an employee of the Group.
Meanwhile, new members of the Board receive a detailed briefing 
on our anti-corruption policies as part of their onboarding 
programme.
For current employees of Setia, we focus on building knowledge 
within the regulatory landscape of business ethics. In line with 
this focus, IGU organised a Round Table Discussion on anti-
bribery and anti-corruption for our employees in 2023, providing 
a recap of the Corporate Liability Provisions contained in Section 
17A of the MACC Act 2009, a refresher on our standards and 
processes relating to corruption and fraud, and a recap of our 
whistleblowing system.
Lastly, we conduct Setia Integrity Roadshows to drive awareness 
of our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies amongst our 
Business Associates. Business Associates are also required to sign 
the Setia Integrity Pledge, formalising their agreement to uphold 
our standards in all business activities concerning the Group.

Adopting Effective Environmental Management Strategies
We take a holistic approach to minimising negative environmental impacts, leveraging effective technological solutions, industr y best 
practices and continuous engagement with our key stakeholders.
Project Planning
During the project planning phase, 
we consider all potential 
environmental impacts of our 
developments including emissions, 
energy use, waste, material use and 
impacts to biodiversity, with our 
findings used to amend and improve 
our plans. 
Renewable Energy 
Wherever possible, we utilise 
renewable energy to power our 
business activities. In addition, we 
design our properties to enable easy 
adoption of sustainable solutions 
such as solar panels and EVs.
Sustainable Materials
In our Eco-Series projects, we use 
eco-friendly construction materials 
that contribute to improved indoor 
air quality and a healthier living 
environment for our customers.
Waste Reduction
We promote waste reduction 
approaches across our workforce 
and have implemented a food waste 
composting facility at our Setia Eco 
Park development.
Energy-Efficiency Technologies
We are progressively implementing 
LED lighting solutions across our 
projects and have developed smart 
concepts for lighting and air 
conditioning systems that deliver 
improved energy efficiency, among 
other solutions.
Awareness and Training
We provide our employees and 
Business Associates with training on 
pertinent environmental issues to 
enable more effective action.
Ensuring Supplier Compliance
Our environmental management responsibilities extend 
to our supply chain, and we have adopted a stringent 
approach towards ensuring the compliance of our 
suppliers to our standards.
Prior to being appointed, all potential suppliers must 
undergo a diligent pre-qualification process that includes 
an assessment of their environmental management 
processes and track record, and are required to commit 
to a service-level agreement that outlines the environmental 
management standards they must adhere to.
After appointment, we monitor their performance on 
environmental management criteria through bi-weekly 
audits at project sites, placing focus on construction waste 
management, noise pollution, air pollution and effluent 
management, among other areas. Our approach to 
contractor environmental performance is further fortified 
by the carrying out of Environmental Impact Assessments 
and the implementation of environmental management 
plans, empowering a project-specific approach to 
identifying and managing environmental risks.
Our GQM department plays a leadership role across our environmental management efforts, ensuring our continued compliance with 
environmental regulations and overseeing our varied initiatives. They are supported by HSE Officers at each of our Business Uni ts, 
who are responsible for ensuring compliance at the project site level.
As the building and construction industry faces numerous challenges, we are 
required to continuously commit and protect our planet and its people. By 
stringently managing our environmental impact in line with global best practices, 
we can play a leadership role, building better communities that deliver shared 
value for our customers, employees and our business.
ENVIRONMENT
As a property developer, we recognise the impact that our business activities have on natural environments. To minimise 
negative outcomes, we have taken a proactive approach to environmental management that centres around the prevention 
of negative environmental impacts and the effective management or reduction of such impacts where they occur. This 
commitment is operationalised through the adoption of best practices in environmental standards and the implementation 
of eco-friendly business strategies and processes.

EMISSIONS
As the global climate crisis increases in urgency, its effects are increasingly being seen around the world in the form of risi ng 
temperatures, extreme weather events and environmental degradation. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, the 
Building and Construction Industry (“BCI”) contributed globally to 37% of energy and process-related CO2 emissions in 2021. Therefore, 
as a conscientious property developer, we have a responsibility to set a positive example in reducing emissions within our oper ations 
and across our supply chain.

Implementing Carbon Reduction Initiatives
To reduce emissions across our processes and our 
developments, we are progressively introducing 
green solutions such as solar panel systems, 
energy-efficient lighting and solar water heater 
systems. Further to this, we are also providing the 
necessary infrastructure to support climate-friendly 
behavioural change amongst our customers – for 
instance, by installing electric vehicle chargers and 
solar switches that they can use to facilitate their 
use of renewable energy.
Our actions here are epitomised by Setia 
eGreenLiving, a set of smart and sustainable home 
elements that we have already standardised across 
all upcoming developments.
Presently, all homes in Setia Bayuemas include 
green switches and are equipped for the installation 
of EV chargers as well as solar panels.
Meanwhile, homes with a value of above RM1 
million are provided complete with pre-installed 
solar panels.
For more information on Setia eGreenLiving, please 
refer to the “Innovation” topic on page 135.
Our Performance
Note: All data presented below relates to our Malaysian operations only.
Non-compliance to Environmental Laws and Regulations:
During the year under review, the Group was not involved in or responsible for any major environmental violations.
Awards Received: In 2023, we received the following awards for our environmentally sustainable practices:
Moving Towards Net Zero
Recognising the importance of decarbonising our business, we 
have set the goal of achieving a:
– 45% reduction in Scope 1 carbon emissions by 2030, and a 
70% reduction by 2040, relative to a 2023 baseline
– 45% reduction in Scope 2 carbon emissions by 2030, and a 
70% reduction by 2040, relative to a 2023 baseline
Ultimately, our long-term objective is to become a net zero 
organisation by 2050. This will also enable us to contribute 
substantially to Malaysia’s Nationally Determined Contribution 
(“NDC”) pledge to reduce nationwide GHG emissions intensity of 
GDP by 45% before 2030, relative to a 2005 baseline.
In 2023, we established our Group-wide emissions baseline for 
Scope 1 and 2, providing us with a reference point to evaluate 
our emissions reduction efforts against, while also formulating a 
comprehensive emissions data collection process which is 
currently being rolled out across our Business Units.
Our emissions reduction targets are set out in the Setia Green 
Roadmap, as shown in the following infographic.

Fostering a Climate Action Culture
Our workforce plays a critical role in actualising our climate ambitions and, in 
turn, we are investing in capacity-building initiatives that will enhance their 
ability to make a difference. 
In 2023, our workforce were availed of the following trainings and resources 
on emissions and climate change:
– Setia Sustainability Day – Panel Session and Speaker Session (31st May
2023)
– Decarbonisation Workshop by Arup Advisory
• Board training (11 October 2023)
• Senior Management training (25 September 2023)
• Management and Executive training (6 September 2023)
Identifying Our Climate-related Financial Risks and Opportunities
In 2023, we adopted the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). A key facet of the TCFD framework is 
the identification of climate-related financial risks and opportunities, which we 
have disclosed in the “Establishing Strategies for Climate-related Risks and 
Opportunities” topic on page 176.
By integrating emissions reduction and business strategy through TCFD, we 
aim to foster a more concerted approach towards climate action that aligns 
business thinking with the imperative of protecting our planet. As such, the 
risks and opportunities we have identified will play a crucial role in shaping 
our Group-level strategies moving forward.
Our Performance

Our aim is to integrate these technologies and approaches across all upcoming developments to minimise our energy consumption. 
This is also a strong selling point for our customers, as energy-efficient technologies enable them to reduce their emissions a nd 
their electricity bill.
Further to this, we organise awareness and training sessions for our employees that educate them on energy-saving practices and  
encourage them to adopt energy-efficient habits when at work.
Implementing Renewable Energy Solutions
We recognise the transformative impact that renewable energy can have on energy use and emissions. Having started our explorati on 
of renewable sources with the use of solar water heating systems, we have since expanded our focus to include the installation of 
solar panels for on-site renewable energy generation at our properties. In 2023, we accelerated this adoption process, commissi oning 
a total of 218GJ of solar capacity across four projects.

WASTE
Our business has a large presence that spans our offices and our various project sites, and this makes responsible waste manage ment 
an important consideration. By implementing effective measures to reduce the waste we generate and redirect waste from disposal , 
we can reduce our overall environmental footprint, protect natural habitats in our vicinity and enhance the attractiveness of o ur 
developments to end-consumers. Failure to do so, however, harms not only the environment but also our reputation, while putting
us at the risk of legal repercussions.
Understanding Our Waste Footprint
Our waste footprint spans a variety of waste types across various locations, and can be broadly described by the following cate gories::
Office/Domestic Waste
Waste from our offices, such as paper, printer cartridges, 
boxes and packaging, in addition to food waste from our 
offices and properties. Waste of this type is sent to a legal 
landfill for disposal.
Construction Waste
Waste generated as debris from our construction activities, 
such as concrete, bricks, wood, steel and plastic, or from 
unused materials. Waste of this type is sent to a legal 
landfill for disposal.
Maintenance Waste
Waste generated from the maintenance of our properties, 
such as trimmings, grass clippings and other organic 
materials. Waste of this type is sent to a legal landfill for 
disposal.
Scheduled Waste
Hazardous waste that has the potential to damage the 
environment, such as spilled oil, contaminated soil and 
oil-filled rags. Waste of this type is collected and disposed 
of by a legal scheduled waste collector.
All waste is handled, collected and disposed in full compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Quality Act 1974. To
enable improvements to our waste performance, we maintain comprehensive records of the amount of each type of waste generated 
and conduct regular audits and surveys to verify the data we collect.
ENERGY
As a major contributor to Group-wide emissions, energy use is an important focus area within our overall environmental manageme nt 
efforts. Our approach here is to progressively introduce energy-efficiency technologies wherever practicable while advancing ou r 
adoption of renewable energy.
Driving Energy Efficiency
To reduce Group-wide energy consumption and enhance the energy efficiency of our properties, we have introduced the following solutions:
Smart Lighting and 
Air Conditioning
These advanced systems 
utilise IoT-based monitoring 
to detect and turn off a 
specific light or air 
conditioning unit when not 
in use, thus saving energy.
Double-glazed 
Windows and 
Louvres
By installing double-glazed 
windows and louvres, we 
reduce heat gain by 
buildings, thus reducing 
the need for air  
conditioning to be used.
Sun-facing Designs
We utilise sun path  
analysis when designing 
our properties to maximise 
natural sunlight exposure, 
reducing the need for 
lighting.
Solar Water Heating 
Systems
By using solar energy to 
heat water, we reduce the 
amount of electricity 
required to carry out this 
daily process.

Developing a Group-wide Waste Management Plan
We are presently in the midst of developing a comprehensive waste management plan that will span the entirety of our operations . 
To facilitate this, Setia Eco Templer has been established as a pilot project for our plan, with key focus areas and metrics fo r waste 
management identified across the short-term, mid-term and long-term timeframes.

Note: This programme was established by Setia Eco Templer and will be rolled out Group-wide.
Reducing Waste Generation
Our approach to reducing waste starts at the largest and most consequential part of our business: our construction sites. Large  in 
scale and complex in nature, our construction sites have the potential to generate large amounts of waste simply through unused  
materials if effective material use planning is not carried out. To address this issue, we are steadily adopting the IBS constr uction 
technique across more of our projects. IBS is distinctive in that it involves the modelling, precasting and prefabricating of b uilding 
components prior to construction. This means that material use can be more accurately forecasted, leading to less unused materi als 
and reduced waste. 
We have adopted the IBS 
construction technique in our projects 
to reduce construction waste
We contribute food items to NGOs 
such as Green Hero, who then 
distribute the food to charities and 
homes in need
Even with IBS, our project sites generate a significant amount of waste as a 
by-product of the construction processes we undertake, and it is vital that we 
reduce the amount of this waste that goes to landfill. To facilitate this, waste 
generated at our project sites is meticulously sorted to identify materials that 
can be recycled. We then work with licensed service providers who collect 
and recycle these materials for reuse. 
At our offices, meanwhile, we are taking steps to reduce waste by installing 
recycling bins that facilitate trash separation by paper, plastic, metal and glass, 
with our employees encouraged to use these bins and adopt other circular 
practices in their everyday lives. Further to this, we are reducing use of paper 
in our offices as part of our Group-wide digitalisation effort, towards the goal 
of achieving fully paperless offices across our business. 
Food waste is another key focus area of our efforts. The zero waste philosophy 
is engrained within our F&B and hospitality outlets, whereby food is distributed 
to NGOs such as Green Hero, who then distribute the food to charities and 
homes in need. Meanwhile, commercial waste is sent to our food composting 
machine to be converted into compost for landscape maintenance purposes.
Supporting Circular Economy Practices
Looking beyond our core construction activities, we maintain properties that 
are homes to tens of thousands of people, and by encouraging their adoption 
of responsible material use practices we can make an even bigger impact.
As an example, we installed a recycling station at our Setia Fontaines Heritage 
Park development and organised a Recycle Day event in collaboration with 
Tzu Chi to create awareness and inculcate better practices amongst residents 
of the community. Our D’Network @ Setia Eco Park development, meanwhile, 
is equipped with a food composting facility for the use of its residents, resulting 
in the successful diversion of 24.74MT of food waste from the landfill – and 
into fertiliser – in 2023. 
We have also introduced paper waste reduction initiatives across our developments 
including hand dryers to reduce the use of paper in toilets and the replacing of 
paper menus with digital menus. In addition, recycling bins are placed across 
commercial and common areas of our developments 
to encourage responsible waste management amongst 
residents.
Lastly, our fabric recycling programme is an innovative 
way to reuse used curtains, uniforms and other fabrics 
used by our business and our employees. These 
fabrics are upcycled into tote bags, pillow cases, coin 
pouches and other attractive corporate gifts, thus 
creating awareness of our recycling efforts amongst 
our stakeholders and the general public.

MATERIALS
We use a variety of materials to construct our developments, many of which are sourced from both natural environments and 
construction waste. To minimise negative impacts, we are integrating the use of eco-friendly and recycled materials into our 
construction processes.

Using Eco-friendly Construction Materials
With the aim of reducing our extraction of materials 
and creating healthier living environments for our 
customers, we are progressively introducing the 
use of eco-friendly construction materials such as 
low Volatile Organic Compound (“VOC”) paint, 
tempered glass, bluescope metal steel roofs, 
asbestos-free cellulose fibre cement boards, 
reinforced wall panels and eco-label tiles. These 
materials reduce our customers’ exposure to 
potentially harmful chemicals, contributing to a 
higher quality of life.
Utilising Construction Waste in Landscaping Efforts
In support of the circular economy, we reuse construction waste as part of 
our property landscaping activities, thus minimising unnecessary use of materials 
during this process. The most recent examples of our work here include:
Setia Bayuemas Lake Park:  Using leftover HDPE panels and crusher 
runs to develop a mural wall and a landscape feature 
Bandar Setia Alam:  Using an on-site boulder as decoration and 
redeploying tree trunks to create benches and pathway steps
Setia EcoHill and Setia Alamsari:  Using boulders and topsoil from 
the construction site as part of the development’s landscape features
Setia AlamImpian: Using boulders from the construction site to create 
swales and a creek while redeploying a tree trunk from the site’s 
clearing to create benches and natural trails
Some of the solutions we have implemented include:
Water-efficient Appliances
These solutions waste less water while enabling us to 
meet specific operational requirements
Water-efficient Fixtures
Solutions like motion-sensor taps and dual flush toilets, 
in addition to the use of IoT technology to automatically 
detect leakages in pipes and taps
Equally, we recognise the important role that society and local communities play in reducing water consumption. To promote wate r 
saving practices across our workforce, we regularly organise water conservation campaigns which are promoted across our premise s 
and common facilities and utilities, such as toilets and pantries.
Responsibly Discharging Wastewater
Irresponsibly discharged water can affect irreparable damage to waterways, the 
marine life within them and the communities that depend on them to carry out 
economic activities. To minimise risk of negative impacts from the discharging of 
water, we have aligned our practices fully with local regulations and best practices.
As a basis, we adhere fully to the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and the 
National Sewerage Systems Act 1993, which details clear standards for sewage 
and industrial effluent discharge. Our discharges are required by law to meet 
specific limits for various pollutants, and we must obtain consent from the 
Department of Environment (“DOE”) before undertaking discharges. 
On top of our compliance to national laws, we refer to and benchmark our 
performance against industry-recognised standards in water quality and water 
discharge management, including:
Adopting Circular Practices 
Our business activities place considerable demand 
on the municipal water system, in turn impacting 
Malaysia’s available water resources. To counter 
this negative impact, we are actively adopting 
circular practices which leverage the rich natural 
resources our land banks offer.
In 2023, we installed rainwater harvesting systems 
across 208 of our semi-detached and bungalow 
units. These systems collect rainwater that falls on 
our land banks and process it for use in our 
landscaping and other activities. Moving forward, 
we will also install rainwater harvesting systems in 
homes across all upcoming developments as part 
of our Setia eGreenLiving initiative, thus 
encouraging sustainable water use amongst our 
customers.
On a similar note, we use lakes located within our 
developments as water retention ponds, with the 
water used for landscaping and irrigation purposes. 
These ponds also form an important mitigation 
measure against the risk of water shortages, offering 
us a ready-made backup solution should any 
municipal water supply cuts threaten our access to 
water.
In addition, we have implemented water recycling 
systems to maximise the reuse of water within our 
operations.
National Water Quality 
Index (“NAWQI”)
NAWQI sets benchmark 
values for various water 
quality parameters, guiding 
our efforts to improve the 
quality of our discharge. 
Green Building Standards
We are guided by the water use and 
discharge standards set within the Green 
Building Index (“GBI”), Leadership in 
Energy and Environmental Design 
(“LEED”), Greenmark and GreenRE rating 
systems, which are internationally 
recognised.
Sustainable Drainage Systems (“SuDS”)
We adhere to the best practices of SuDS – defined as environmentally 
beneficial drainage systems – and adopt these practices in designing 
our own systems.
WATER AND EFFLUENTS
Water is an important resource that is used across 
our business for various purposes including general 
cleaning, landscaping and as an input in our 
construction activities. As such, any instances of 
water scarcity can hamper our ability to meet 
delivery deadlines, impacting our business prospects. 
At the same time, water is a sensitive natural 
resource that is crucial to the livelihoods of 
communities and the health of natural environments. 
For these reasons, it is imperative that we adopt 
responsible, well-considered approaches to water 
extraction, usage and disposal.
Reducing Our Water Use Footprint
Conscious of the importance of water as a shared 
resource of society, we strive to minimise our 
consumption by leveraging purpose-fit technologies 
and approaches. 
Our Performance
Note: All data presented below relates to our 
Malaysian operations only.

BIODIVERSITY
Our construction activities involve disruptions to natural habitats. This poses risks not only to the plant and animal species that live 
within these habitats but may also upset the natural balance of the ecosystem, leading to negative impacts on water quality, ai r 
quality and food security, and thus to local communities and the residents of our developments too.
Our Approach to Biodiversity
We adopt a balanced approach to managing 
biodiversity impacts across our developments. While 
our business necessarily depends on the use and 
transformation of natural landscapes, we take care 
to ensure that our activities minimise long-term 
damage. Furthermore, we invest in conserving and 
restoring natural habitats within our land banks with 
the aim of building communities where humans, 
flora and fauna can co-exist in harmony. In doing 
so, we enhance quality of life for our residents and 
set a positive example for other developers in the 
region to follow.
Understanding our Biodiversity Impacts
In seeking to minimise disruptions to natural 
habitats, we consider a variety of potential impacts 
including:
Impact Description
Ecosystem Disruption
We undertake land clearing to build our 
developments, leading to the removal of 
vegetation and the disruption of existing 
ecosystems. This can lead to the complete 
loss of habitat for various plant and animal 
species.
Air Pollution
Machinery, vehicles and construction 
materials may release particulate matter and 
emissions that contribute to air pollution.
Water Pollution
Runoff from our sites may carry pollutants 
into nearby water bodies, impacting aquatic 
ecosystems.
Noise Pollution
Noise pollution from our construction 
activities may disturb wildlife and alter the 
behaviour of animals.
Reduction of Flora 
and Fauna Species
The destruction of natural habitats during 
construction may threaten existing flora and 
fauna species, leading to population decline 
or extinction.
Our efforts to protect flora and fauna species from these risks start from the beginning of the lifecycle of new projects. Duri ng the 
pre-development phase, regular ecological assessments are conducted, followed by a review of biodiversity-related risks and 
opportunities. This empowers our teams to develop site plans that minimise disruption to natural habitats and, at the same time, 
maximise the potential of these habitats to improve the attractiveness of the end development to customers.
Environmental Impact Assessments are also carried out to gauge the potential impact of our developments on natural environments , 
including biodiversity. These assessments are conducted whenever deemed necessary throughout the project lifecycle.
Restoring Natural Habitats
Once our developments are complete, our focus 
turns to the restoration and rehabilitation of natural 
habitats. 
Across our developments, we invest in extensive tree 
planting initiatives aimed at enhancing biodiversity 
and enticing animal species to return. In 2023, we 
planted 746 trees within our development sites, 
bringing our total trees planted to 24,278 across 325 
acres of land. Taking this further, Adventure Park at 
Setia Ecohill 2 is an 18-acre forest that hosts a wide 
variety of trees – including native species – alongside 
eco-friendly amenities for our customers such as 
jogging tracks and mountain biking lanes. The forest 
stands on land that used to be part of a rubber 
estate, and our extensive efforts have successfully 
altered this monocultural setting for the better, 
creating a whole new habitat for a greater variety 
of wildlife to thrive.

species that were not detected when the previous survey of the land was 
conducted in 2017.

Our HSE Governance Structure
Our HSE Governance Structure empowers effective oversight and response to health and safety matters that arise at all levels of  the 
Group. 
The structure is pillared on OHS Committees at the Group-level and within each of our Business Units, which are responsible for
monitoring risks, investigating issues and implementing initiatives across all project sites. In addition, we have established OHS 
Committees at all our offices and project sites.
Our Business Unit-level committees meet on a monthly basis to remain attuned and responsive to evolving work environments and 
maintain continuous dialogue with project site managers and employees to drive understanding and adherence to our standards.
All OHS Committees report to the Group’s Safety Committee, which is overseen by our Chief Operating Officer and supervised by 
GQM and HSE representatives. This promotes accountability and ensures the consistent and effective implementation of policies a nd 
procedures across our operations. 
In addition to the committees detailed above, each of our project sites also 
has an HSE Committee, as per the regulations of the Department of Occupational 
Safety and Health and as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 
1994 (“OSHA 1994”). These committees – which meet once a month to discuss 
OSH matters – are chaired by the respective project managers of the project 
site in question, each of whom are supported by a secretary (an HSE officer) 
and comprise of employer and employee representatives for balanced 
consideration of risks and actions. In the case of project sites managed by 
contractors, the HSE Committee also includes representatives from our project 
implementation team.
Our Occupational Health and Management System
Our Group-level Occupational Health and Management System (“OHS 
Management System”) is designed to safeguard the health and wellbeing of 
every individual contributing to our business. It provides detailed guidance on 
the correct practices to adopt in carrying out all activities conducted within 
our operations, from routine day-to-day tasks to specialised operational 
activities, with processes tailored to mitigate against risks that are specific to 
the activity in question. Further to this, tailored risk management approaches 
are implemented to complement our existing system in certain situations where 
our employees conduct highly specialised activities and are thus exposed to 
unique risks.
The system is certified under ISO 45001:2018 – 
Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
and ISO 14001:2015 – Environmental Management 
System, validating our maintenance of internationally-
recognised standards in health and safety. Its coverage 
extends to all employees within the Group, including 
permanent, contract and part-time staff, in addition 
to all employees of our contractors when they carry 
out work at our project sites. 
Continuous Monitoring and Review
To ensure the optimal performance of our system 
and foster ongoing enhancements, we regularly 
engage in comprehensive management reviews to 
assess the methodologies employed throughout 
our various project sites. This systematic evaluation 
encompasses several key aspects, including:
1. Compliance with legal and other requirements
2. The approach of our employees to hazards, risks 
and opportunities in the project environment
3. Progress against Group-level objectives
4. The efficacy of operational and other controls
The betterment of communities stands at the heart of our purpose as an 
organisation. By putting people ﬁrst and delivering lasting impacts to those around 
us, we can safeguard our sustainability as a business.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
At Setia, we take a proactive stance towards occupational health and safety. Through our robust governance structure 
and an effective management system, we stringently monitor risks and implement purpose-fit and project-specific measures 
to safeguard our employees, business associates, customers and the general public. Beyond mitigating occupational 
hazards, we strive to maintain healthy and happy workplaces that promote holistic physical and mental wellbeing.

In addition to these ongoing evaluations, HSE audits are performed by our 
GQM department on a monthly basis at project sites. These audits serve to 
ensure strict compliance with established standards, practices and policies, and 
extend to the oversight of contractor compliance. Audit findings are promptly 
communicated to the manager responsible for the project site or activity in 
question, who assumes responsibility for implementing corrective actions, with 
a subsequent follow-up conducted to verify the efficacy of these measures. 
The manager also communicates relevant information to workers and their 
representatives, fostering collective understanding and action.
Through our rigorous monitoring and review procedures, we systematically 
document our HSE performance across project sites. This documentation serves 
as a foundation for continuous improvement, enabling us to refine health and 
safety processes and enhance overall outcomes.
Furthermore, we conduct a minimum of one internal audit annually at the 
Group level. The primary objective of this audit is to assess the effectiveness 
of our policies and procedures, ensuring alignment with overarching HSE 
objectives. 
To drive continuous improvement in our HSE performance, we have also 
established HSE Inspection Score, a monthly score issued to each respective 
project across the Group. In 2023, we achieved 84.52%, far surpassing our 
target score of 75% for the fourth consecutive year.
In addition, we carry out Job Hazard Analysis 
procedures, whereby each job task is analysed to 
identify specific actions that pose a risk of severe 
injury. Regular checks on equipment and machinery 
are also carried out to ensure they are in good 
working condition.
Across our processes, we take care to ensure that 
the input of our project teams, consultants and 
employees is considered. This aids in ensuring a 
balanced view of project site hazards and risks, 
empowering more effective risk mitigation efforts.
Incident Investigation Processes
When workplace incidents occur, we ensure that 
responsive action is taken immediately by qualified 
professionals, including on-site safety officers and 
our Emergency Response Team (“ERT”), to ensure 
the safety of all individuals involved and mitigate 
any further risks and dangers caused by the 
incident. The incident is then meticulously recorded, 
with the relevant Person in Charge (“PIC”), typically 
a designated safety officer or supervisor, informed 
promptly via text. Subsequently, an email is 
dispatched within 24 hours of the incident to the 
PIC, the Head of the Group Safety Committee and 
the Secretary of the Group Safety Committee, 
providing comprehensive details for further review 
and necessary follow-up actions.
After this, an investigation is promptly initiated, 
involving the Group Safety Committee, the ERT and 
representatives from the Business Unit in question. 
This investigation involves the use of root cause 
analysis to identify the underlying factors that 
contributed to the incident, and may involve reviews 
of existing procedures, the equipment used at the 
project site and employee actions leading up to 
the incident. This enables the formulation of 
appropriate corrective measures to prevent 
reoccurrence, with insights shared across other 
relevant project sites for collective improvement.
Employee Participation in Workplace Safety
Our project implementation teams have a frontline 
view of hazards and risks, and we value their input 
as an essential enabler towards enacting more 
effective processes and creating safer workplaces.
All project site employees are represented on their 
project site-specific OHS Committee, which meets 
monthly, or their office OHS Committee, which 
meets every quarter. In addition, project site 
employees contribute to key HSE processes including safety meetings, hazard 
and risk assessments and control measure formulation. This provides them the 
opportunity to express concerns transparently and engage in open, two-way 
communication. They also take part in weekly toolbox meetings where they 
can discuss specific safety issues and share experiences in an informal setting.
In addition, we have established Health and Safety Committees at each project 
site, with these committees having decision-making authority on matters related 
to health and safety procedures, implementation and initiatives. As part of their 
committee, project site employees contribute to enhanced safety by working with 
their management team to identify workplace hazards and conduct regular safety 
inspections. Their participation also gives them the opportunity to suggest 
appropriate safety training programmes suited to the unique challenges they face.
HSE Training and Awareness
In striving to creating a safety-centric culture across the Group, we organise 
regular training programmes on health and safety for our project site and 
management-level employees. Programmes offered include:
Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment 
Processes 
Each of our project sites present specific risks to 
employees, contractors and the environment. As 
such, it is essential that we maintain thorough 
processes to identify site-specific hazards and risks. 
As a basis, we conduct regular inspections of 
worksites to identify and assess potential hazards. 
Based on the findings of such inspections, we 
prioritise hazards using a risk matrix, assessing their 
importance based on potential impact and likelihood 
of occurrence, thus enabling us to channel 
resources to address the most critical issues 
identified first. 
On a day-to-day basis, project site operations 
teams are responsible for assessing risks and 
promptly addressing any instances of non-
compliance. Our GQM department also conducts 
monthly audits across all ongoing projects to 
identify areas for improvement, thus ensuring that 
our risk controls remain up to date as projects 
evolve, while regular reviews of risk assessments 
are undertaken to ensure their continued relevance. 
Any changes in processes, equipment or work 
environment triggers an immediate re-evaluation 
of associated risks.
Monthly HSE 
audits, contractor 
oversight and swift 
corrective actions 
ensure strict 
adherence, while 
Group-level audits 
align policies 
with HSE 
objectives. We 
achieved a HSE 
Inspection Score 
of 84.52% in 
2023, far 
surpassing our 
target score of 
75% for the fourth 
consecutive year.
Safety Induction
All new employees and workers at project sites are required to attend 
a full safety and health induction
Ongoing Safety Training Sessions
Regular sessions to reinforce fundamental safety practices and raise 
awareness about potential workplace hazards
e 
Emergency Response Training
In-depth training on emergency response procedures, including 
evacuation plans, first aid and proper use of emergency equipment 
 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA) Training
Specific guidance for employees to conduct a Job Safety Analysis for 
the identification and mitigation of safety risks
r 
Legal Compliance Training
Up-to-date information on relevant occupational health and safety 
laws, regulations and compliance requirements 
y
It is compulsory for project site employees to attend trainings in scaffolding, 
machinery operation, working at height and emergency response procedures. 
These vital trainings help to ensure that they have the capabilities to minimise 
safety risks while on the job. 
We also strive to encourage excellence in health and safety by rewarding 
high-performing employees with the opportunity to undertake safety certification 
programmes. Additionally, supervisors and managers are provided with training 
on safety leadership, empowering them with the knowledge and skills to further 
a culture of safety within their workplace.
Non-occupational and Healthcare Services
Beyond the workplace, we want our employees to 
lead healthy, happy and balanced lives. To this end, 
we offer programmes, benefits and other services 
that promote holistic mental and physical health.
We conduct mental health awareness programmes 
on a regular basis, including through our partnership 
with Naluri, providing our employees with 
information, resources and training to address non-
work related mental health risks. These programmes 
are geared towards helping them develop the tools 
to combat stress, build resilience and maintain a 
healthy work-life balance. Furthermore, our 
employees can access fully sponsored counselling 
services to confidentially discuss any personal issues 
they may encounter with a qualified professional.
To promote physical health, we offer our employees 
comprehensive educational resources across key 
health and wellness topics, covering healthy lifestyle 
choices, nutrition and exercise. Voluntary fitness 
and wellness challenges are also organised on a 
periodic basis to encourage physical fitness, with 
these challenges creating a sense of camaraderie 
amongst employees. 
These initiatives are in addition to the comprehensive 
health insurance coverage that we provide all 
employees, which covers preventive care, routine 
check-ups and specialist consultations. We also 
provide healthcare navigation services, aiding our 
employees in selecting suitable providers to meet 
their healthcare needs.
Contractor Safety
We work with a variety of suppliers and business 
partners across our projects and understand that 
any discrepancies in health and safety standards 
can increase the level of risk faced by employees 
of both parties and the general public. 
The process of managing such risks starts before 
a contractor is appointed. During the project 
bidding phase, potential contractors must detail 
their health and safety management processes, with 
these processes forming important criteria in the 
selection process. Specifically, contractors must 
demonstrate adherence to OSHA 1994, and we 
encourage building and major infrastructure 
contractors to obtain ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 
45001:2018 certification, validating their 
commitment to creating a safe working environment.

Thereafter, once a contract is awarded, the contractor is required to submit a detailed HSE plan for management review, while 
employees of the contractor undergo induction training on our standards and processes. In addition, a comprehensive risk assess ment 
is undertaken to identify any risks that may arise due to the health and safety processes of the contractor, with appropriate p reventive 
measures and controls put in place to minimise risks identified. This may include engineering controls, administrative controls  and 
the use of personal protective equipment (“PPE”) to mitigate identified hazards. 
To maintain standards and minimise risks as projects progress, we apply the same practices that we use internally to our contra ctors. 
This includes continuous monitoring of practices, regular audits of project sites and ongoing communication of health and safet y 
updates, as well as access to mechanisms to report health and safety incidents or concerns. Further to this, employees of our 
contractors are availed of ongoing training and awareness sessions, tailored to the specific risks associated with their projec t.
Our Performance
Work-related Fatalities, Lost Time Incident Rate and Employees Trained on Health and Safety Standard
In 2023, we recorded zero number of cases work related fatalities for employees and non-employees. Our Lost Time Incident Rate 
(“LTIR”) was 0.68 for employees and 0.02 for non-employees.
In 2023, 943 of our employees and 2,535 non-employees received training on our health and safety standards, representing a mark ed

Customer data privacy is spearheaded by our Group Legal department and 
the heads of our Business Units, who work collaboratively to monitor and 
address any potential threats that emerge. At the same time, we recognise 
that employees stand at the frontline of data protection, and thus invest in 
initiatives to ensure they embed good data protection practices in their everyday 
work. This includes:
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
The satisfaction of our customers is central to 
maintaining our reputation as a trusted and 
progressive property developer, which in turn 
impacts our ability to execute our strategies and 
realise our growth objectives. To keep our 
customers happy, we adopt a multifaceted approach 
aimed at achieving excellence in product quality, 
customer service and business practices, while 
safeguarding our customers’ data privacy through 
robust controls and measures.
Establishing Customer Satisfaction KPIs
We aim to make customer satisfaction a priority 
across our business. To this end, we have set 
customer service KPIs for our frontline staff and 
avail them of relevant training modules that are 
delivered on a regular basis throughout the year.
To ensure our desired standards are upheld, audits 
are conducted on our customer service levels, with 
learnings promptly disseminated for improvement 
measures to be implemented.
Evaluating Our Performance
To measure our customers’ satisfaction level and 
guide continuous improvement to our customer 
service, we conduct twice-yearly surveys. These 
surveys require customers to provide feedback 
across six key aspects of the customer journey, 
empowering a holistic assessment of our 
performance.
Protecting Customer Data Privacy
The security of our customers’ data is paramount 
to the trust they hold in us as an organisation. With 
cybersecurity risks evolving fast, we employ leading 
threat protection technologies to ensure that our 
customers’ data is protected against loss, theft, 
misuse and unauthorised access, usage, alteration 
and destruction, while adhering strictly to the 
requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act 
(“PDPA”). Customer data is only kept for as long as 
is necessary to fulfil the requirements of our Privacy 
Policy, thus further reducing the risk of data 
breaches occurring.
Our Performance

To claim personal/carer’s leave, employees are required to submit relevant 
supporting documentation, such as a doctor’s letter that certifies the medical

Building Diverse Workplaces
We believe that diverse work environments lead to a more dynamic, motivated 
and productive workforce. To this end, we nurture workplaces where everyone 
feels valued for the unique talents they offer and has an equal opportunity to 
progress in their career.
As the basis of our approach, we commit to providing equal access, rewards 
and resources to employees regardless of race, gender or religion, and to 
eliminating workplace discrimination in all its forms.
A key focus area of our efforts is gender diversity and inclusion. Our Women 
of Inspiration (“WIN”) initiative, established in 2017, hosts programmes and 
activities throughout the year to create productive dialogue around the 
challenges and opportunities facing women in the workplace. Organised under 
the three pillars of Leadership, Engagement and Communication, the initiative 
provides our women employees with resources to build their skills and 
leadership competencies while working to break biases and build a gender 
diverse mindset across our workforce. These outcomes ultimately contribute 
to our goal of retaining our female talent, realising their potential, raising them 
up the management ladder and building a respective and inclusive environment 
– the “4Rs”.
Reflecting the importance of gender diversity and inclusion, WIN is led by our 
Board of Directors, sponsored by our CEO, chaired by our COO and run by 
our committee of diversity advocates, also known as “DiVas”. In 2023, WIN 
organised a calendar of events to celebrate International Women’s Day, focused 
around the theme of “Embracing Equity”. This included story features on female 
leaders, employees and young talent making an impact across our business, 
a fun Purple & Pink Day where all employees could show their support, and 
EmpowHER, a two-hour event open to all employees and Business Associates 
that celebrated the achievements of women and spotlighted our commitment 
to driving gender equity in the workplace.
All employees receive the 
following benefits:
• Leave entitlement
• Outpatient and hospitalisation coverage
• Staff purchase discounts
• Study loans
• Professional membership annual 
subscription fee
EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT
Our people are the fuel behind our progress. They 
maintain our high quality standards, uphold our 
culture and drive action towards achieving our 
strategic objectives. 
To bring the best out of our employees and our 
business, we provide highly competitive remuneration 
and benefits, invest in impactful training and 
upskilling initiatives, and strive to build diverse and 
inclusive workplaces that encourage transparent 
communication and innovative thought. Doing so 
drives the retention of our workforce and enhances 
our reputation as an employer of choice, delivering 
shared value for our business and our people.
Providing Competitive Remuneration and 
Benefits
In line with our goal of driving talent attraction and 
retention, we provide our employees with competitive 
remuneration and benefits packages that are 
commensurate with their capabilities, experience and 
level of responsibility assumed within the Group. 
Employees are remunerated in accordance with 
their job grade, as reflected in our pay structure, 
and we adhere to a salary range of 45%. In addition 
to their base salary, employees are provided with 
yearly performance-based rewards which are 
determined based on their achievement of set KPIs 
and their competencies. 
To support our employees in balancing work with 
the need to take care of their loved ones, we 
provide five days of personal/carer’s leave per year, 
which can be claimed in the following

Nurturing Our Talent
Acknowledging the pivotal role our employees play in our business success, we are committed to driving their continuous growth 
and professional development through focused, role-specific training programmes. 
In line with our commitment, we allocate 2% of our Annual Gross Salary towards comprehensive training programmes. Programmes 
are developed according to our business needs and competency gaps, in alignment with our strategic development goals, with this  
process led by our GHR department. The department communicates our development focus through the GHR channel on an ongoing 
basis, fostering a shared vision among employees, while keeping track of training programmes, their duration and attendance levels 
via a purpose-fit system.
In 2023, our focus in employee development was on driving alignment to our new vision and mission, fostering stronger and more 
cohesive teams across our business and continuing our journey in improving service and quality standards within our service and  
technical teams. Key programmes included:
Vision-Mission Roadshow
This roadshow aimed to 
strengthen our employees’ 
understanding, commitment 
and alignment to our new 
corporate vision and mission, 
thus fostering a shared sense 
of purpose and collective 
action towards achieving our 
aspirations. With 27 sessions 
held across our business 
footprint, including outside 
Malaysia, the roadshow reached 
a total of 1,650 employees.
Technical Tea Talk and other compulsory technical trainings
Through a series of compulsory trainings, we forged a common understanding amongst our technical team members on our 
quality and HSE expectations. These employees also had access to insights on various topics related to technical and construction 
work through our Technical Tea Talk sessions, empowering them to continue learning and growing in their roles. A total of 635 
employees attended these sessions.
Corporate Team Building 
(“Thriving As One”)
In support of our new 
vision and mission, we 
organised corporate team-
building sessions – themed 
“Thriving As One” – for a 
total of 1,708 employees. 
The sessions aided in 
fostering stronger bonds 
across our workforce while 
encouraging openness and 
flexibility in preparing for 
change.
Sales & Service Pathway and Service Exchange Series
Our Sales & Service Pathway sessions aimed to instill the 
mindset of a consultant within our sales and marketing team 
and other frontline employees, encouraging them to approach 
their work with the objective of delivering customer-centric 
experiences through partnerships and personalisation. 
Supporting this, the Service Exchange Series functioned as a 
platform for knowledge and experience sharing across the 
different roles that our frontline employees fill (e.g. customer 
relations, credit administration, property management), 
empowering better service standards and exceptional customer 
experiences.
Collectively, these trainings impacted a total of 1,466 employees.
In our pursuit of excellence in training and development, we measure the effectiveness of our approach through key metrics incl uding 
employee feedback on training programmes, our Employee Engagement Score (People Pulse Score), our Customer Satisfaction Score 
and our Succession Index.

Developing Future Leaders
In addition to our employee training programmes, we introduced the People4ward@Setia programme to instill the specific skills t hat 
our leaders need to make a bigger impact on their teams. 
The programme consists of four modules and includes business simulations and brown bag sessions to facilitate understanding and  
practical application. Key areas covered include talent management and the evolution of leadership skills in the digital realm,  with a 
particular emphasis on agility and talent dexterity. These elements collectively contribute to our goal of nurturing leaders wh o can 
use digital tools to their advantage and lead digitally-savvy talent. In 2023, 23 senior managers completed the programme.
Our succession planning efforts also include the Setia Mentorship Programme, which connects up-and-coming future leaders with 
experienced mentors across the following pairings:
This six-month programme is open to employees who have been identified as a potential future leader of the Group. Through their
mentorship, they get access to valuable insights gained across the career of their mentor, who in turn contributes by mapping o ut 
a career development plan that will maximise the potential of their mentee within the Group. After the programme concludes, the
mentee is then evaluated and, if successful, selected as a potential successor.
Enabling Concerns and Issues to be Raised
We want our employees to feel that they can raise any issues or concerns they may have – whether pertaining to suspected 
wrongdoing by a member of staff, discriminatory treatment at the workplace or any other issue – without fear of reprisal. To th is 
end, we have established a grievance procedure that is open to all employees of the Group, as detailed below.
• To submit a grievance, employees must complete a grievance form and submit it to their performance manager or immediate 
supervisor within four days 
• The manager in question will then take steps to resolve the issue, failing which the grievance is escalated to the GM of the d ivision 
or Business Unit in question 
• Further efforts are taken to resolve the issue, failing which the grievance is escalated to the GHR department
• If further efforts to resolve the issue are unsuccessful, the grievance is escalated to the Deputy President and Chief Operating 
Officer, or to the President and Chief Executive Officer, who then decides on the necessary steps to resolve the issue
Upholding Labour Rights
In line with our commitment to fair employment practices, we implemented our Labour Rights Policy on 1 July 2023. The policy is  
in alignment with the expectations of and the framework provided by PNB and comprises six material matters:
Forced and Child Labour Diversity and Inclusion
Right to Freedom of Association Safety and Health
Fair Wages and Benefits Upskilling and Education
Setia Mentorship Programme (Mentor-Mentee Matching)
Mentor Mentee
Executive Vice President/Divisional General Manager Head of Department (“HOD”)/General Manager (“GM”) Level
GM/Deputy General Manager Senior Manager Level
Senior Manager/HOD Level Manager Level
In each of these matters, the policy defines clear commitments and standards that we expect of ourselves, our employees and our
Business Associates. Through this, it empowers us to ensure consistency in employment practices across our business footprint a nd 
strict adherence to prevailing laws and regulations in our countries of operation.
During 2023, there were no substantiated complaints concerning human rights violations across the Group.

LABOUR MANAGEMENT
Recognising the importance of our employees towards reaching our goals as a business, we have established a wide range of labou r 
management practices covering every aspect of their work with us. Collectively, these practices enable us to engage with our 
employees more effectively, understand and address their concerns, and ensure their satisfaction at work. 
At the same time, we are committed to upholding our employees’ right to freedom of association and adopt a similarly stringent 
approach towards ensuring our workplaces and those of our business associates are free of any form of child labour and forced o r 
compulsory labour.
Our Established Labour Management Practices
Our approach to labour management is geared towards achieving the following objectives:
Fostering Healthy and Happy Workplaces
Understanding the clear link between employee well-being and satisfaction, we have implemented a variety of initiatives that su pport 
holistic physical and mental health across our workforce.
In addition to our various mental health campaigns (see “Occupational Health and Safety” on page 156 for more), we have launche d 
the extensive Setia Cares programme in collaboration with Naluri, providing our employees with resources and tools that include :
Providing Flexibility to Employees
Workplace flexibility is another way that we support our employees’ holistic wellbeing. Our approach here comprises three polic ies – 
Flexible Working Hours (“FWA”), Work From Anywhere (“WFA”) and Working From Home (“WFH”). Each empowers our employees to 
more effectively balance their work commitments with their duties at home such as taking care of their children or parents. 
In addition to these policies, we have also introduced Smart Casual Fridays to promote a more informal work environment prior t o 
weekends. 
• Monthly webinars
• A digital coaching programme
• On-site or video-based therapy sessions
• Professional health coaching
• Digital tools and self-monitoring devices
• Physical health screenings
• A 24/7 dedicated careline
• A wellness website where they can access all services centrally
The programme covers all employees across our workforce, empowering them to adopt healthier lifestyle habits and proactively 
address any issues they may be facing – whether at the workplace or in their everyday lives. As evidence of its impact, the pro gramme 
achieved the following results during 2023:
1,836 employees recruited 
on to the Naluri app
341 employees attended 
customised webinars
863 employee chat sessions 
completed
921 health screenings 
completed across a 15-day 
roadshow
Flexible Working 
Hours
The employee is given the flexibility to manage their own 
working hours provided that:
• He or she is available, in the office, from 10am to 5pm, 
which are our core hours of work; and 
• He or she completes nine working hours at the office, 
including their lunch break
Working From Home
This arrangement is applicable for employees who are required to be physically away from the office under 
the following circumstances: 
• Office space is unavailable due to the impact of a natural disaster (e.g. flood, earthquake, fire, etc.)
• A pandemic causes the employee’s office to be closed 
• Any other crisis situation that prevents the employee from coming into the office (e.g. hostage, blackout, etc.) 
• Other unavoidable circumstances which are not listed above and which require the employee to work from home. For example:
– An employee who is infected or who has had close contact with a person infected with a contagious disease
– An employee who is attending to a personal issue, such as a death in the family
Work From 
Anywhere
This arrangement allows an employee to work in another 
Setia office, instead of travelling to their base office, in 
order to avoid heavy traffic jams. The employee may also 
arrange his or her work schedule to meet their commitments 
at home and foster greater work-life integration.
Approval is subject to the nature of the employee’s work 
and the availability of office space.

Eradicating Forced or Compulsory Labour
In line with our CoCBE, we have established clear and comprehensive measures 
and rules to eradicate any instances of forced or compulsory labour.
As a basis, all employees have the right to leave their workplace premises after 
completing the standard workday and are free to terminate their employment 
provided that they provide reasonable notice. 
Should any person be found to be in a forced labour situation, be it intentionally 
or unintentionally, we take immediate steps to remedy the issue and prevent 
a reoccurrence of the violation. Steps that we may decide to take include:
Engaging Our Employees
To foster transparent, two-way communication with 
our employees, we conducted various engagements 
throughout 2023 including:
• Corporate teambuilding sessions which aimed 
to foster stronger interpersonal bonds and 
preparedness for change across our workforce
• Our Vision & Mission Roadshow, which aimed 
to strengthen employees’ understanding and
support of our new vision and mission
Supporting Freedom of Association
We support our employees’ right to freedom of 
association and act fully in compliance with local 
labour laws pertaining to freedom of association. 
Standing Against Child Labour
We stand firmly against all forms of forced labour 
and child labour, including modern slavery, bonded 
labour and human trafficking. To this end, we align 
our practices and standards with the Core Labour 
Standards of the International Labour Organisation 
and the Children & Young Persons (Employment) 
Act 1966 of Malaysia.
Should any person below the age of 15 be hired, 
the child or young person must cease work 
immediately.
Instituting strong disciplinary and/or legal actions on anyone found 
to be profiteering or taking advantage by employing or introducing 
persons that may eventually be put under forced labour situations
Ensuring all persons involved in the recruitment process are trained 
on social compliance standards
Implementing additional mechanisms or measures to identify 
potential forced labour practices and prevent them from taking place
Putting our labour agents through rigorous screening mechanisms 
to ensure they recruit workers ethically

Operations and Suppliers at Significant Risk of Forced or Compulsory 
Labour
We expect all business associates that we do business with to uphold our firm 
stance on forced or compulsory labour, as detailed above. Should a pattern 
of violations become known to the relevant decision-maker(s) within the Group, 
and this behaviour is not rectified within a reasonable timeframe, the business 
relationship is discontinued.
COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
The advancement of communities is central to our philosophy as a company. Our corporate purpose of Creating Sustainable 
Communities refers not only to the developments we build and the lifestyles we offer our customers but embodies our entire 
approach to business, including the positive impacts we create for communities beyond our developments and across Malaysia.
Through our extensive community-based programmes, we aim to meet the needs of the physically or economically disadvantaged, 
drive improved educational outcomes, promote national unity and social inclusion, and support Malaysians in times of natural di sasters 
or other crises. Collectively, these efforts contribute to the socioeconomic advancement of the nation, build trust between us and 
our stakeholders and provide us with the social license to undertake our business activities.

Managing and Mitigating Community 
Impacts
Our construction activities involve the clearing of 
land and the disruption of natural habitats, which 
may in turn affect local communities by:
• Depleting natural barriers against extreme 
weather events and natural disasters
• Impacting the ability of local community 
members to generate a living via agricultural or 
other nature-dependent economic activities
• Negatively affecting the health of local 
communities through pollutants released from 
construction sites
To minimise the likelihood of these negative 
impacts, we carry out Environmental Impact 
Assessments at all project sites during the planning 
stage. This enables us to proactively identify and 
minimise environmental risks and their potential 
impacts on communities.
Local Community Development  
Programmes
In 2023, we launched “Sincerely, Setia” as SPSF’s 
flagship initiative, with the mission to spread 
kindness and love to all underserved Malaysians. 
The initiative represents the true essence of giving 
and selflessness, serving as a testament to our 
generosity and commitment, and encompasses four 
key focus areas: Disaster Relief, Community and 
Health, Education, and Unity.
At the same time, we have continued to launch 
further activations under the Setia Caring School 
Programme, which has been SPSF’s main initiative 
since 2015. The programme aims to bridge 
educational gaps amongst the underserved, granting 
equitable opportunities to B40 and disabled students 
through targeted educational aid and collaborative 
unity initiatives.
Some of the highlights of our community work in
2023 are spotlighted below.

ADOPTING THE TCFD RECOMMENDATIONS
In 2023, we adopted the TCFD recommendations. In doing so, we aim to enable more informed decision-making on our business 
prospects and outlook in light of the risks and opportunities brought about by climate change.
Governance of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities:
Our governance of climate-related risks and opportunities leverages our established sustainability governance structure, which covers 
all sustainability issues across the Group.
Board of Directors
Management Sustainability Committee
Board Sustainability Committee
Sustainability Working Group
Overseeing overall sustainability strategy and performance
Ensuring proper implementation, monitoring and tracking of initiatives
Overseeing our strategy, priorities, policies and targets
Implementing initiatives across the group
The governance structure is designed to provide a 
clear line of reporting, thus ensuring that all 
climate-related risks and opportunities across the 
Group are identified in an appropriate and timely 
fashion.
The Sustainability Working Group is responsible for 
identifying sustainability matters and implementing 
solutions across our business. It provides the 
Management Sustainability Committee with quarterly 
updates on climate-related matters including but 
not limited to emissions target setting, the setting 
of emissions baselines and the preparation of the 
Setia Green Roadmap. The Management 
Sustainability Committee, which includes our CEO 
and members of our senior management team, 
then reports on these sustainability matters to the 
Board Sustainability Committee. Sustainability risks, 
including climate-related risks, are also updated to 
the Board Sustainability Committee.
In addition to this reporting structure, our Management Risk Team – which is 
chaired by our CEO and comprises members of our senior management team 
– reports updates on sustainability risks, including climate-related risks, to our 
Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The Risk Management 
Committee is chaired by an Independent Non-Executive Director and comprises 
other members of the Board, ensuring high-level strategic input on risks 
identified.
Ultimately, the relevant sustainability matters, including climate change risks, 
are reported to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has ultimate 
oversight on all sustainability matters, including those related to climate change.

Integrity in Corporate Reporting 
and Meaningful Relationship with 
Stakeholders
As a values-based organisation, we promote world-class 
business practices and robust institutional governance and risk 
frameworks, with strong emphasis on transparency, 
accountability, effective leadership and sustainable performance.
The Board of Directors (“Board”) remains committed to building 
resilience through the adoption of best corporate governance 
policies and practices to ensure long-term business sustainability 
in a challenging and fast-moving business landscape.
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to report that this 
Corporate Governance Overview Statement has been prepared 
in accordance with statutory requirements, guidelines and 
practices and cover the following areas as required by the 
Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (“MCCG”):
(A) Board Leadership and Effectiveness
(B) Effective Audit and Risk Management
(C) Integrity in Corporate Reporting and Meaningful 
Relationship with Stakeholders
This Statement outlines the governance framework, processes,
and control mechanisms in place within the S P Setia Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2023. (“FY2023”). It seeks to 
provide stakeholders with an understanding of how the Board 
and its Committees performed for the year under review and 
outlines key areas of focus of the Board and its activities 
undertaken during the year, as we continue to drive long-term 
value creation for all our stakeholders.
Additionally, other than the MCCG, the following frameworks 
were applied:
• Bursa Malaysia’s Corporate Governance Guide 4 th Edition
• Companies Act 2016 (“CA 2016”)
• Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”) of Bursa 
Malaysia Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”)
The Board’s governance oversight is guided by a strong
commitment and well-defined responsibilities. It is a conscious 
effort by the Board and Management at every level of the 
organisation to lead by example, embrace corporate values, 
implement best practices and create an organisational culture 
that optimises performance, accountability and contribution. 
The Board embraces its diversity and leverages on the 
credentials each member brings to ensure effective stewardship 
of Management. The Board continues to achieve a balance of 
skills, knowledge and experience, independent and objective 
viewpoints through the different perspectives of the Directors. 
The Board recognises the importance of progressive refreshing 
of the Board in order to bring new skills and perspectives to 
further improve the Board’s performance. In year 2023, we 
have seen changes to the Board composition that were in line 
with the Company’s robust Board Succession Plan with 
reference to nine (9) year limit for all Directors adopted by the 
Company.
The Board is fully committed to placing sustainability at the 
heart of the Group’s growth strategy. The Group’s Sustainability 
Framework charts our path to sustainable operations and 
strengthens our commitment to ensuring exemplary 
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) standards, 
ensuring that the value we create is not only strategic but also 
sustainable.
In the year ahead, as we navigate through a business 
environment fraught with risks, yet also abundant with 
opportunities, the Board recognises that it has never been 
more important for the Company to have strong governance 
fundamentals and to be committed to upholding them to the 
highest standards. At S P Setia, a substantive checks and 
balance regime is in place with the Board having oversight of 
the risk management frameworks and policies within the Group. 
Moving forward, I am confident we have the essential 
ingredients that will allow the Group to remain resilient and 
operate from a position of strength, ready to leverage on 
growth opportunities in this challenging business environment.

 BOARD LEADERSHIP
S P Setia is led by a Board which is responsible for the stewardship 
of the business and affairs of the Group on behalf of our 
shareholders and all other stakeholders. The Board’s primary role 
is to determine S P Setia’s strategic objectives and policies to 
deliver sustainable value to its shareholders in ensuring the 
protection of shareholder value. The Board takes into account 
the interests of stakeholders including employees, business 
partners, local communities, regulators and the general public.
Whilst shareholders and the Board jointly provide oversight on 
the control and management of the Company, the ultimate 
decision-making authority vests with the shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting, where, amongst others, important 
resolutions such as the re-election and remuneration of the 
Directors and appointment of External Auditors are considered 
and approved. The Board on the other hand, is accountable to 
the shareholders for the performance of the Company. In this 
regard, the Board directs and monitors the business and affairs 
of the Company on behalf of the shareholders.
In discharging its duties and responsibilities effectively, the Board 
is guided by the Board Charter. S P Setia’s Board Charter sets 
out the Board’s strategic intent, authority and ToR and serves as 
a primary source of reference and induction literature. In addition, 
the Board Charter outlines the requirements, roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, Board Committees and individual 
Directors. To ensure that it remains relevant, the Board Charter 
is reviewed periodically or as change arises to ensure that the 
Company is at the forefront of best practices in corporate 
governance. The Board Charter was last updated in 2023. The 
Board Charter is available on the Company’s corporate website, 
https://spsetia.com/en-us/governance.
 BOARD MEETINGS
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved specifically for 
the its decision, which includes among others, approval of the 
annual business plans and budgets, material acquisitions and 
disposal of assets, major capital projects, financial results and 
dividend recommendations.
The Company utilises a secured application to disseminate 
meeting papers to the Directors electronically. This serves to 
ensure that the Directors are able to have access to meeting 
materials more efficiently and expeditiously.
Aside from the Board meetings, urgent matters are decided via 
written circular resolutions. Deliberations and decisions arrived at 
during Board meetings are clearly minuted in a timely manner 
and action items for Management will be communicated to the 
relevant parties after the Board and Board Committee meetings 
so that actions could be taken expeditiously. The draft minutes 
are then tabled at the following meeting for confirmation and 
thereafter signed by the Chairman as a correct record of the 
 BOARD DIVERSITY 
The Board believes that a truly diverse and inclusive Board will 
leverage differences in thought, perspective, knowledge, skill and 
industry experience in order to ensure that the Company retains 
its competitive advantage. The Board recognises that diversity 
and inclusiveness are key drivers to enhance its effectiveness 
and providing the Board the benefits of different perspectives to 
bear on issues that are aligned to the interest of stakeholders.
Diversity is also important to ensure the Company remains 
relevant and sustainable in the rapidly evolving business.
The Board strives to ensure a mix of member profiles in terms 
of age, ethnicity, gender, academic and professional qualifications 
and skills that will provide the necessary range of perspectives, 
experience and expertise required to achieve effective stewardship, 
thereby creating value.
Accordingly, the Board continues to focus on diversity when 
assessing new candidates for Board membership or the re- 
election of Directors according to the Company’s Constitution. 
The Board considers a diverse range of qualified candidates with 
 BOARD COMPOSITION
The composition of the Board exceeds the requirements of Paragraph 15.02 
of the MMLR as more than one-third of its members are Independent Non-
Executive Directors of the Company (“INEDs”). The Board also took cognisance 
of Paragraph 5.2 of the MCCG which requires boards of large companies to 
comprise a majority of independent directors. The Board comprises individuals 
with diverse backgrounds who bring a range of skills, perspectives and corporate 
experience to our boardroom. The Directors are selected based on their 
individual merit and experience. The Board continuously strives to ensure that 
Directors have a collective mix of skills, experience, expertise and diversity to 
add value to Board processes and decisions. The Board’s size ensures that the 
purpose, involvement, participation, harmony and sense of responsibility of the 
Directors are not jeopardised and that it achieves the correct balance to realise 
the Group’s strategic objectives. It also ensures inclusiveness of views as well 
as to facilitate effective decision-making and constructive deliberation during 
meetings.
The Board oversees and appraises the overall strategic objectives, 
strategic direction and performance of the Group with some 
strategic oversight delegated to Board Committees. The Board 
ensures that the strategic plan supports long-term value creation 
and includes strategies on economic and ESG considerations thereby 
strengthening the integration of sustainability in the Group’s 
operations. Through sustainable practices, the Group becomes more 
resilient, is able to create durable and sustainable value and maintain 
simultaneously, the confidence of stakeholders. The Board ensures 
that it is well positioned to satisfy its oversight responsibility through 
periodic assessment of Board agenda priorities to make certain that 
it is well-informed on a timely basis of matters requiring attention. 
A detailed review of the Group’s strategy is conducted by the Board 
annually (including its purpose and strategic objectives).
Together with Management, the Board promotes good governance 
culture within the Group ensuring ethical leadership, prudent and 
professional behaviour in the conduct of its business and in all aspects 
of its operations. The Board considers each Non-Executive Director 
(“NED”) to be independent in character and judgement. The Board 
is satisfied that each Director has devoted sufficient time to effectively 
discharge his/her responsibilities during the year under review.
The current composition of the Board has a blend of skills, 
experience and knowledge enabling them to provide effective 
oversight, strategic guidance and constructive challenge, examine, 
review and decide on Management’s proposals and empower 
the President and Chief Executive Officer (“PCEO”) to implement 
strategies approved by the Board. In delegating its authority to 
Board Committees, the Board does not abdicate its responsibility 
and ensures that its delegation does not hinder or reduce its 
ability to discharge its functions.
proceedings thereat. The Board ensures that key transactions or 
critical decisions are deliberated and decided on by the Board in 
a meeting. The Board also ensures that decisions and basis for 
those decisions, including any dissenting views are made known 
and properly minuted by the Company Secretary. To ensure there 
is sufficient time for discussion, deliberation and decision, the 
Board utilises its six principal Committees. At each Board meeting, 
the agenda ensures that there is sufficient time for the Chairman 
of each Board Committee to report on contents of discussions, 
any recommendations to the Board which require approval and 
the actions taken. Members of Senior Management attend Board 
meetings to present their proposals and support the Board with 
further and additional information on the matters being deliberated 
and to report on matters pertinent to their areas of responsibility.
All Directors have access to the services of the Company 
Secretary and any Director may initiate an agreed procedure 
whereby independent professional advice may be sought at the 
Company’s expense.

Corporate Governance Overview Statement
DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
The positions of the Chairman and the PCEO are held 
separately by Y.A.M. Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Syed Anwar 
Jamalullail and Datuk Choong Kai Wai respectively. This 
segregation ensures a clear distinction between the 
Chairman’s responsibility to manage the Board and the 
PCEO’s responsibility to manage the Company’s business.
There is clear division between executive and non-executive 
responsibilities which ensures accountability and oversight. 
The roles of Chairman, PCEO, Senior INED and INEDs are 
clearly defined, set out in the Board Charter and regularly 
reviewed by the Board and are available on our website 
under Corporate Governance.
PCEO
• Manages the day-to-day business affairs.
• Responsible for the overall management of the Group, ensuring that strategies, policies and matters set by the 
Board are effectively implemented in line with the Board’s direction.
• Regularly reviews the performance of the heads of divisions and departments who are responsible for all functions
contributing to the success of the Group.
• Serves as the conduit between the Board and Management in ensuring the success of the Group’s governance 
and management functions.
INED/NON-INED
• Ensures that business and investment proposals presented
by Management, key transactions or critical decisions 
are fully deliberated, examined and decided on by the 
Board in a meeting.
• Plays a key role by providing unbiased and independent 
views, advice and judgement, which take into account 
the interests of the Group and all its stakeholders 
including shareholders, employees, customers, business 
associates and the community as a whole.
Chairman
• Leads the Board in setting the Group’s key
policies and direction.
• Chairs and conducts meetings of the Board
and shareholders and ensures that they are 
properly briefed at their respective meetings.
• Facilitates meetings of the Board and ensures
that no Board member, whether Executive or 
Non-Executive, dominates the discussion, and 
that healthy debate takes place. 
• Instils good corporate governance practices,
leadership and effectiveness of the Board.
• Ensures the provision of information to
Directors in a timely manner.
Senior INED
• Designated contact to whom concerns 
pertaining to the Group may be
conveyed to by shareholders and other 
stakeholders.
• Chairs meetings of the Board and
shareholders in the absence of the 
Chairman.
• All queries which require SID’s attention
can be emailed to philip.tan@spsetia.com
Company Secretary
• Plays an advisory role to the Board, particularly with regard to the Company’s Constitution and Board policies 
and procedures as well as compliance with relevant rules and regulations.
• Ensures that the discussions and deliberations at Board and Board Committee meetings are well documented 
and subsequently communicated to the relevant Management for appropriate action.
• Updates the Board and Board Committees on the follow-up of their decisions and recommendations by
Management.
• Supports the Board in maintaining the highest standards of probity and corporate governance.
• Primary point of contact for institutional and other shareholders, especially with regard to matters of corporate 
governance.
DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE
The Board recognises the important contributions that 
INEDs make to good corporate governance. All 
Directors, regardless of their independent status are 
required to act in the best interests of the Company 
and to exercise unfettered and independent judgement.
Board decisions are made taking into account the views 
of INEDs which carry substantial weight. They fulfil their 
roles in ensuring that strategies proposed by 
Management and deliberated are examined taking into 
account the interests of the shareholders and 
stakeholders. Their role is particularly critical for related 
party transactions as these require independence of 
judgement and objective impartiality to protect the 
interests of minority shareholders.
For FY2023, the Board was satisfied with the mix of INEDs 
and Non-INEDs, the composition being diverse in 
demographics, skills and experience.
The Board practices robust, open and active discussions 
at Board meetings so as to ensure that opportunities 
are given to all Directors to participate and contribute 
to the decision-making process.
During FY2023, the NRC assessed the independence of 
the INEDs as part of the Board Effectiveness Evaluation 
(BEE) process. The Board was satisfied with the level of 
independence demonstrated by the INEDs, their sound 
and objective judgement to Board deliberations and their 
ability to act in the best interests of the Group, manifested 
through active participation in Board discussions and 
decision-making.
The Board Charter specifies that the tenure of NEDs shall 
not exceed a cumulative term of nine years from the date 
of the first appointment. As at the date of this Statement, 
none of the Directors has served the Board for more than 
nine years.
Aside from the annual assessment, a potential candidate 
shall, prior to the appointment as a NED, submit his/ 
her declaration of independence, where applicable, and 
fit and proper in compliance with the criteria set out 
in the MMLR, to the Board for consideration.

plans to address issues and concerns.

Going forward for year 2024, the Company would maintain the existing Remuneration Framework of the NEDs except for an increase 
in the Board and Board Committee meeting allowance from RM1,500 to RM2,000 per meeting. The Board had taken cognisance of 
the fact that the Remuneration Framework of the NEDs had not changed since 2017 and the proposed increase in meeting allowance 
commensurates with the man-hours spent by the Directors at their respective meetings. The proposal was arrived at after undertaking 
the annual review of the Remuneration Framework of the NEDs in December 2023 against other companies in the property sector.

Statement on Risk Management  
and Internal Control
The Board of Directors (“Board”) of S P Setia is dedicated to 
upholding a robust internal control and risk management system. 
Each business unit has implemented its own control processes 
under the stewardship and oversight of the Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO), who bears responsibility for ensuring both sound 
business practices and regulatory governance.
The Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control was 
prepared pursuant to paragraph 15.26(b) of the Bursa Malaysia 
Securities Berhad (“Bursa Securities”) Main Market Listing 
Requirements (“Main LR”) and guided by the Statement on Risk 
Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of 
Listed Issuers (“the Guidelines”).
 BOARD RESPONSIBILITY
The Board upholds its commitment and responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems. This 
oversight extends beyond financial controls, to encompass 
strategic, operational and regulatory compliance aspects, as well 
as ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness of these systems to 
uphold S P Setia’s performance and integrity. 
The implementation of these control systems is undertaken by 
the Management, which regularly reports on key risks identified 
and actions taken to mitigate and/or minimise such risks. The 
oversight of these critical areas is carried out by the Sub-Board 
Committees, namely, the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) 
and the Audit Committee (“AC”).
The Group’s risk management and internal control systems are 
designed to efficiently and effectively manage risks within 
acceptable parameters, to ensure the achievement of the Group’s 
business objectives, furnishing accurate information for reporting, 
decision-making, and ensuring compliance with regulatory and 
statutory requirements.
The Board also ensures the presence of a robust framework of 
ongoing risk management processes encompassing the 
identification, evaluation, and management of significant risks 
faced by the Group to foster the long-term success of the 
Company. The design of these systems primarily focuses on the 
management and mitigation of identified risks, rather than their 
complete elimination, a strategy which is consistently reviewed 
and reassessed by the Management. 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
The Group Risk, Integrity and Governance (“GRIG”) has established 
an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework to proactively 
and systematically identify, evaluate, and control key risks to 
acceptable parameters. Aligned with the Group’s commitment 
to deliver sustainable value, this ERM framework strives for a 
comprehensive and structured approach across the entire Group. 
It outlines the ERM methodology in accordance with the 
Principles and Guidelines of ISO31000:2018 Risk Management, 
with primary emphasis on fostering risk ownership and continuous 
monitoring of identified key risks.
“S P Setia continues to monitor and evaluate the changing business landscape and monitors changes to the legal and 
regulatory requirements to proactively mitigate risks and explore potential opportunities to enhance competitiveness.

A. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT
The oversight role of risk management is carried out by the Risk Management Committee (“RMC”) and the Board. The success 
of implementing ERM programmes relies significantly on the mandate and commitment from RMC and the Board. These 
entities set the strategic direction for risk policies, define roles and responsibilities, and establish the structure for risk reporting. 
Periodic reporting on risk management initiatives is carried out by the Management Risk Team (“MRT”) to both the RMC and 
Board which keeps the RMC and the Board apprised on the Group’s key risk areas, progress of risk action plans and emerging 
risk and trends.

The MRT is supported by GRIG, which plays a crucial role in ensuring the successful and effective implementation of ERM and 
BCM framework, programmes, and facilitates continuous education and awareness throughout the Group. Furthermore, GRIG 
provides independent and objective assessment of key risks, along with timely reporting to the MRT, RMC and the Board. This 
collaborative effort contributes to a comprehensive and effective risk management and business continuity approach across the 
organisation.
B. ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
The Board acknowledges risks inherent in the normal course 
of the Group’s core businesses, which present both threats 
and opportunities. The ERM policy has been developed to 
facilitate the effective implementation of ERM framework, 
which aligns with the Group’s overarching aspiration in 
achieving its corporate objectives and meeting shareholders’ 
expectations. The outlined risk policy serves as a guiding 
principle for the management of risks and is applicable 
across all Business Units within the Group: 
• To manage risk proactively;
• To manage both adverse and favourable risks;
• To manage risks pragmatically to acceptable parameters,
tailoring responses to each situation while maintaining 
acceptable risk levels;
• To ensure that the process of risk assessment is
systematically integrated into the organisational system;
• To manage risk consistently in an integrated and 
transparent way in accordance with good governance 
practices; and
• To mandate the creation and upkeep of an effective, 
formalised risk management framework within S P Setia.
C. RISK REPORTING
The Group’s ERM Framework incorporates periodic reviews 
and reporting practices. The reports encompass 
comprehensive information such as the risk profiles, action 
plans, and status updates. Throughout the reviewed year, 
these reports were systematically presented on a quarterly 
basis and deliberated upon by the MRT, RMC and the Board.
D. RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES
As part of the Group’s effort to infuse a proactive risk 
management culture and encourage ownership, the following 
initiatives were undertaken during the year under review:
• Series of continuous ERM Culture and Education
Programmes which includes ERM technical briefings/
trainings, awareness and refresher sessions. 
• On 21 March 2023, GRIG, in collaboration with Group
Internal Audit (“GIA”) co-organised the “ Sembang Nasi 
Lemak 2.0’ titled, Effective Leadership for Good 
Governance”. This hybrid (physical and online) forum is 
for members of the Board Management, and Team Setia. 
The session featured an insightful and engaging discussion 
with the Chairman of S P Setia, YAM Tan Sri Dato’ Seri 
Syed Anwar Jamalullail who shared his invaluable 
experience on Board leadership, which he effectively 
managed and practiced good governance, whilst navigating 
business challenges in a competitive business landscape.

initiatives for the embedment of high integrity culture and 
effective management of integrity and governance matters in 
S  P Setia.
The Group Integrity & Governance Unit (“IGU”) of S P Setia Berhad 
had been established to be in-line with the Prime Minister’s 
directive to (“the Directive”) all Government Linked Companies 
(“GLCs”) in October 2018. The IGU will facilitate the compliance 
to the Corporate Liability provision under Section 17A of the 
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (“MACC”) Act, 2018 
(Amendment), which has been enforced since 1 June 2020. 
Based on the Directive and Guideline for the Management of 
Integrity and Governance Unit issued by the MACC in 2019, the 
IGU is responsible for the execution of the following four (4) 
core functions:
•  Complaints Management – To receive and respond to all 
complaints and information concerning violation of possible 
criminal, improper conduct and ethics of S P Setia Berhad.
• Detection and Verification – To identify and verify complaints 
with regard to possible criminal, improper conduct and the 
violation of the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics of 
S  P Setia Berhad and ensure appropriate actions are taken. 
To report criminal and corruption related offences to the 
relevant enforcement agencies.
• Strengthening Integrity – To inculcate, institutionalise and 
implement the concept of integrity in organisation.
•  Governance – To strengthen integrity among the staff in
addition to dealing with issues related to integrity, particularly 
bribery, corruption, abuse of power or other malpractices.
The IGU has a direct reporting line to the RMC and ultimately, 
the Board.

S P Setia’s integrity and governance framework has been 
established and endorsed by the Board of Directors with specific 
references to:
i. The National Anti-Corruption Plan 2019;
ii. The Guidelines on Adequate Procedures by the Prime 
Minister’s Department;
iii. ISO 37001:2016 on Anti-Bribery Management System
(“ABMS”);
iv. Setia’s core values “SCRIPT”; and
v. ISO 37002:2021 on Whistleblowing Management Systems
– Guidelines.
The framework took into consideration S P Setia’s readiness and 
preparedness in facing the possible challenges and impact of 
the enforcement of the Corporate Liability provision. S P Setia 
is continuously embarking on initiatives to ensure that adequate 
measures are in place as a defence mechanism based on the 
TRUST principle under the Guidelines on Adequate Procedures, 
issued by the Minister of the Prime Minister’s Department. The 
existing Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) implemented 
by S P Setia expired in December 2023. In line with the continuous 
improvement initiatives, the Board has also approved S P Setia 
Anti-Corruption Plan covering the period of 2024 – 2026. This 
is a clear manifestation on the Top-Level Commitment (the first 
capital ‘T’ of the TRUST principle) in Setia, in ensuring our 
aspiration to uphold ‘Zero Tolerance’ to bribery and corruption 
is well prepared and implemented.
The following policies have been approved by the Board for 
implementation and compliance by Team Setia and Setia’s 
Business Associates: 
i. Anti-Bribery and Corruption (“ABC”) Policy;
ii. Code of Conduct and Business Ethics;
iii. Whistleblowing Policy;
iv. Gifts and Hospitality Policy;
v. Donations and Sponsorship Policy; and
vi. Third Party Engagement Policy.
As per the Bursa Securities’ Main LR, these policies are accessible
by the Public, Business Associates and Team Setia either via 
Setia’s corporate website or Setia Intranet platforms. The IGU 
has the responsibility to facilitate and oversee the enforcement 
of these policies, ensure awareness and effectiveness of its 
implementation. 
The IGU also facilitates the Corruption Risk Assessment (CRA) 
workshops which are being conducted at both Setia Group and 
Business Unit levels. The Corruption Risk Profiles will be re-
assessed and reported to the RMC on a periodic basis.
During the year under review, various initiatives were implemented 
to accomplish the objectives which covers Team Setia, active 
Business Associates (BAs) and relevant authorities. A series of 
structured integrity and governance roadshows were conducted 
targeting Team Setia and BAs in Malaysia as well as in Vietnam. 
We continued our engagements with the relevant authorities in 
areas where our BUs operates to strengthen ties and to facilitate 
effective communication on any potential corruption and bribery 
issues.

FEATURES OF KEY INTERNAL CONTROLS IN S P SETIA
In S P Setia, the “Three Lines of Defence” model as depicted below guides our practice of effective internal controls:
GOVERNING BODY/BOARD/AUDIT COMMITTEE
SENIOR MANAGEMENT
Regulator
External Audit
Management Controls
Internal Control Measures
Line of Defense1st
Internal Audit
Line of Defense3rd
Financial Control
Security
Line of Defense2nd
Risk Management
Quality
Inspection
Compliance
Integrity & Governance Unit
The first line of defence is provided 
by the Senior Management and the 
Heads of Business Units, as the 
process owners are accountable for 
all risks and effective internal 
controls assumed under their 
respective areas of responsibility. 
Senior Management is also  
responsible for promotion of the risk 
culture, which will ensure greater 
understanding of the importance of 
risk management whilst ensuring its 
principles are embedded in key 
operational processes, including 
project evaluation and monitoring.
The Group’s internal control systems 
do not apply to Associate Companies 
and Jointly-Controlled Entities 
where the Group does not have full 
management control. However, the 
Group’s interest is served through 
representation on the Boards of the 
respective Associate Companies and 
Jointly-Controlled Entities.
The second line of defence is 
provided by the GRIG, Group Quality 
Management (“GQM”) and other 
corporate controls. GRIG is 
responsible for facilitating the 
Enterprise Risk Management 
processes based on the approved 
ERM Framework; whereas GQM is 
responsible in ensuring effective 
implementation and compliance 
with the S P Setia Group’s safety & 
health and quality related policies 
and procedures.
The third line of defence is provided 
by the Group Internal Audit (“GIA”). 
GIA provides independent assurance 
on the adequacy and reliability of 
the risk management processes and 
system of internal controls, and 
ensures compliance with related 
regulatory requirements.

Neither during nor at the end of the financial year was the Company a party to any arrangement whose object is to enable the 
Directors of the Company to acquire benefits by means of the acquisition of shares in, or debentures of, the Company or any oth er 
body corporate, other than those arising from the shares or share options granted under the LTIP.
The Directors and officers of the Group and of the Company are covered by Directors and Officers liability insurance for any li ability 
incurred in the discharge of their duties while holding office. During the financial year, the total amount of indemnity covera ge and 
insurance premium paid for the Directors and officers of the Group and the Company are RM30,000,000 and RM70,000 respectively. 
The Directors and officers shall not be indemnified by such insurance for any deliberate negligence, fraud, intentional breach of law 
or breach of trust proven against them.
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
(a) Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps:
(i) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for 
doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and adequate allowance had been 
made for doubtful debts; and
(ii) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to realise their values in the ordinary course of business as shown 
in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which they might be 
expected so to realise.
(b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:
(i) which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial 
statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or
(ii) which would render the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company  
misleading; or
(iii) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of  
the Company misleading or inappropriate.
OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION (CONT’D.)
(c) At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(i) any charge on the assets of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which 
secures the liabilities of any other person; or
(ii) any contingent liability of the Group or of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.
(d) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances, not otherwise dealt with in this report or th e 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the respective financial 
statements misleading.
(e) In the opinion of the Directors:
(i) no contingent or other liability of the Group or of the Company has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable 
within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, will or may affect the ability of the Group 
or of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due; and
(ii) no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen in the interval between the end of the financial  
year and the date of this report which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Group or of the 
Company for the financial year in which this report is made.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Corporate Information
S P Setia Berhad (“the Company”) is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and is listed on  
the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The Company is principally an investment holding company. The principal 
activities and other information relating to the subsidiary companies are provided in Note 8. 
The registered office and principal place of business of the Company are located at S P Setia Berhad Corporate HQ No.12, 
Persiaran Setia Dagang, Setia Alam, Seksyen U13, 40170 Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan. 
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial 
Reporting Standards (“MFRS”), International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2016.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies 
below.
The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are presented in Ringgit Malaysia (“RM”), which is also the 
Company’s functional currency.
Changes in accounting policies
On 1 January 2023, the Group and the Company adopted the following new and amendments to MFRSs:
Effective for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023:
MFRS 17: Insurance Contracts
MFRS 17: Initial Application of MFRS 17 and MFRS 9-Comparative Information (Amendments to MFRS 17)
MFRS 101: Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2)
MFRS 108: Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to MFRS 108)
MFRS 112: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to MFRS 112)
MFRS 112: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to MFRS 112)
Adoption of the above new and amendments to MFRSs did not have any material effect on the financial performance or 
position of the Group and the Company, except for:
MFRS 101: Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2)
The amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance and examples to help entities apply 
materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy 
disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their “significant” accounting policies 
with a requirement to disclose their “material” accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept 
of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments have had an impact on Group’s and the Company’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the 
measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.
MFRS 112: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to MFRS 112)
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions the Group operates. The Group is 
in scope of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation. However, the legislation was enacted close to the reporting 
date. Therefore, the Group is still in the process of assessing the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes as at 31 
December 2023. The potential exposure, if any, to Pillar Two income taxes is currently not known or reasonably estimable. 
The Group expects to be in a position to report the potential exposure in its next financial statements.
The accompanying notes form an integral part of the financial statements.

(a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)
Changes in accounting policies (cont’d)
Standards issued but not yet effective
The standards, amendments and interpretations that are issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the 
Group’s and the Company’s financial statements are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to adopt these 
standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
 
Description Effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after
MFRS 101: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to MFRS 101) 1 January 2024
MFRS 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to MFRS 16) 1 January 2024
MFRS 101: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to MFRS 101) 1 January 2024
MFRS 107 and MFRS 7: Disclosure of Supplier Finance Arrangements  1 January 2024
 (Amendments to MFRS 107 and MFRS 7)
MFRS 121: Lack of exchangeability (Amendments to MFRS 121) 1 January 2025
MFRS 10 and MFRS 128: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and  Deferred
 its Associate or Joint Venture (Amendments to MFRS 10 and MFRS 128)
The Amendments to MFRSs above are expected to have no significant impact on the financial statements of the Group 
and the Company upon their initial application except for the changes in presentation and disclosures of financial information 
arising from the adoption of these Amendments to MFRSs.
(b) Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting 
policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the reporting date, and reported amounts of income and 
expenses during the financial year.
Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, historical experiences 
and various other factors, including expectations for future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, 
actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The critical judgements made in applying the accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are disclosed 
in the respective notes to the financial statements.
(c) Subsidiary companies
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiary companies are stated at cost less impairment 
losses. Impairment losses are charged to profit or loss.
(d) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and of all its subsidiary companies 
made up to the end of the financial year. The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting 
policies for like transactions in similar circumstances.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(d) Basis of consolidation (cont’d)
The Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or 
more of the elements of control. 
All subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition method of accounting from the date of acquisition, being 
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases 
except for I & P Group Sdn. Berhad, Syarikat Kemajuan Jerai Sdn Bhd and Wawasan Indera Sdn Bhd which are accounted 
for based on the pooling of interests method. 
Business combinations under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests method, where the results 
of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for as if the combination had been effected throughout 
the current and previous financial periods. The assets, liabilities and reserves of these entities are recorded at their pre-
combination carrying amounts or existing carrying amounts are accounted for from the perspective of the common 
shareholder. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognise any new assets or liabilities, at the date of the 
combination that would otherwise be done under the acquisition method. No new goodwill is recognised as a result of 
the combination. Any difference between the consideration paid/transferred and the equity acquired is reflected within 
equity as reserve on acquisition arising from common control.
(e) Investments in associated companies and joint ventures
The Group holds interest in joint ventures and associated companies as disclosed in Notes 9 and 10. 
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in associated companies and joint ventures are stated at cost 
less impairment losses. 
 
Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements by the 
equity method of accounting based on the latest audited financial statements and supplemented by management accounts 
of the associated companies and the joint ventures made up to the Group’s financial year end. Distribution received from 
associated companies and joint ventures reduce the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associated companies or joint ventures are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the associated companies or joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless 
the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
The results and reserves of associated companies or joint ventures are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements 
based on audited and/or unaudited management financial statements made up to the end of the financial year and prepared 
using accounting policies that conform to those used by the Group for like transactions in similar circumstances.
(f) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Measurement basis
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of an 
asset. 
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the asset will flow to the Group and to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured 
reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(f) Property, plant and equipment (cont’d)
(ii) Depreciation
Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the depreciable amount of other property, plant and equipment on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives. The depreciable amount is determined after deducting residual value from 
cost.
 
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Leasehold land Lease term of 99 years
Buildings 2% – 14%
Plant, machinery, cranes and trucks 5% – 20%
Renovations, computer equipment, office equipment, furniture and fittings 5% – 33%
Motor vehicles 20%
The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting 
date. 
(g) Investment properties 
Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investmen t 
properties are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the reporting date. Gains or losses arising from 
changes in the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise, including  
the corresponding tax effect. 
When the fair value of the Investment Property Under Construction (“IPUC”) is not reliably determinable, the IPUC is 
measured at cost until either its fair value has been reliably determinable or construction is complete, whichever is earlier. 
 (h) Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) agreement
The Group recognises revenue from the construction and upgrading of infrastructure projects under BOT agreement in 
accordance with the accounting policy for construction contracts set out in Note 1(n) below. Where the Group performs 
more than one service under the arrangement, consideration received or receivable is allocated to the components by 
reference to the relative fair values of the services delivered, when the amounts are separately identifiable.
The Group recognises the consideration received or receivable as a financial asset to the extent that it has an unconditional 
right to receive cash or another financial asset for the construction services. Financial assets are accounted for in accordanc e 
with the accounting policy set out in Note 1(o) below.
When the consideration receivable does not represent an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset, 
the Group recognises the consideration receivable as either development rights or as intangible assets, based on the 
allocation of the fair value of the construction services rendered. The accounting policies for the development rights and 
intangible assets are disclosed in Notes 1(i) and 1(k)(iii) respectively.
 
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(h) Build-Operate-Transfer (“BOT”) agreement (cont’d)
Subsequent costs and expenditures related to infrastructure and equipment arising from the Group’s commitments to the 
BOT agreement or that increase future revenue are recognised as additions to the intangible assets and are stated at cost. 
Capital expenditures necessary to support the Group’s operation as a whole are recognised as property, plant and equipment, 
and accounted for in accordance with the policy stated under property, plant and equipment in Note 1(f) above. When 
the Group has contractual obligations that it must fulfil as a condition of its license to:
– maintain the infrastructure to a specified standard; or 
– restore the infrastructure when the infrastructure has deteriorated below a specified condition,
it recognises and measures these contractual obligations in accordance with the accounting policy for provisions.
Repairs and maintenance and other expenses that are routine in nature are expensed and recognised in profit or loss as 
incurred.
(i) Intangible assets
Intangible assets comprise computer software and a right (a licence) to charge users for public services, namely the right 
to operate Subterranean Penang International Convention & Exhibition Centre (“SPICE”) for a specified period.
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. 
The annual amortisation rates are as follows: 
Right (Licence) to charge users for public services 30 years
Computer software  20%
(j) Leases
(i) Group as a Lessor
Leases where the Group retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset are classified as 
operating leases. When the assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the statement of 
financial position based on the nature of the asset. The accounting policy for lease income is set out in Note 1(r)(ix) 
below.
(ii) Group as a Lessee
– Right-of-use assets
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Buildings 1 to 3 years
– Lease liabilities
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. 
– Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of machinery and equipment 
(i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain 
a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment 
that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are 
recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

(k) Inventories 
(i) Inventory properties
Property acquired or being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of business is measured at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value.
Cost includes:
– Freehold and leasehold rights for land;
– Amounts paid to contractors for construction;
– Borrowing costs, planning and design costs, costs of site preparation, professional fees for legal services, property 
transfer taxes, construction overheads and other related costs; and
– Non-refundable commission cost
Inventory properties under construction are referred to as property development costs and comprise the cost of land, 
direct building costs and a share of development costs common to the entire development project where applicable. 
Once contracted to be sold, the related costs of these inventories would be transferred to cost to fulfil contracts, and 
subsequently recognised in profit or loss as and when control passes to the respective purchasers.
Inventory properties where no development activities have been carried out or where development activities are not 
expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle are referred to as land held for development and classified 
within non-current assets. Generally no significant development work would have been undertaken on these lands 
other than project planning, infrastructure work, earth work and landscape work incurred to prepare the land for 
development and these inventory properties are stated at cost plus incidental expenditure incurred to put the land in 
a condition ready for development. These inventory properties are classified to current assets at the point when active 
development project activities have commenced and when it can be demonstrated that the development activities 
can be completed within the normal operating cycle.
(ii) Raw materials, consumable goods and others
Cost is determined on the weighted average and first-in, first-out basis. In the case of finished goods and work-in-
progress, cost comprises materials, direct labour, other direct charges and an appropriate proportion of factory 
overheads.
(iii) Development rights
Development rights represent the rights to additional density over and above the maximum permissible density for 
the Group’s development projects within the island of Penang, granted pursuant to a BOT agreement as disclosed in 
Note 1(h).
Development rights are recognised to the extent that the Group has performed the construction services for the BOT 
agreement. Development rights are initially measured at cost, which is represented by the allocated fair value of the 
construction services rendered.
Development rights recognised are included as part of the cost of the land held for property development or the 
property development costs of the Group, based on the allocation of the expected utilisation of the development 
rights for the planned property development projects of the Group.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(l) Contract assets and contract liabilities
Contract asset is presented as the excess of cumulative revenue earned or recognised in profit or loss over the billings to 
date to the customer. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment in accordance of MFRS 9: Financial Instruments.
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group or the Company performs its obligation under the contract. 
Contract liability is the excess of the billings to date to the customer over the cumulative revenue earned or recognised 
in profit or loss. Contract liabilities include advance payment and downpayments received from customers and other 
amounts where the Group or the Company has billed before the goods are delivered or services are provided to the 
customers.
(m) Contract cost assets
(i) Incremental costs of obtaining a contract
The incremental costs of obtaining a contract with customers of the Group mainly relate to commission payable on 
sales of properties.
(ii) Costs to fulfil a contract
The costs incurred to fulfil contracts with customers of the Group mainly comprise of costs incurred for the development 
and construction of its property development projects.
Contract cost assets are amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the 
goods or services to which the asset relates as disclosed in Note 1(r). 
(n) Long-term construction contracts
The Group’s long-term construction contracts are all fixed price contracts and where their outcome can be reasonably 
estimated, revenue is recognised on the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is determined by the 
proportion that costs incurred to-date bear to the estimated total costs, and for this purpose, only those costs that reflect 
actual contract work performed are included as costs incurred.
Where the outcome of a long-term construction contract cannot be reasonably estimated, revenue is recognised only to 
the extent of contract costs incurred that are expected to be recoverable. At the same time, all contract costs incurred 
are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Costs that relate directly to a contract and which are incurred in securing the contract are also included as part of contract 
costs if they can be separately identified and measured reliably and it is probable that the contract will be secured. 
When it is probable that total costs will exceed total revenue, the foreseeable loss is immediately recognised in profit or 
loss irrespective of whether contract work has commenced or not, or of the stage of completion of contract activity, or 
of the amounts of profits expected to arise on other unrelated contracts.
On the statement of financial position, contracts in progress are reflected either as contract assets which is the surplus of 
(i) work performed to date recognised under the percentage of completion method or over time, or (ii) the billings made 
to date. A contract liability would represent the surplus of (ii) over (i).

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(o) Financial instruments – initial recognition and subsequent measurement 
(i) Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets of the Group are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortised cost and 
fair value through profit or loss whilst all financial assets of the Company are measured at amortised cost.
The Group’s and the Company’s financial assets at amortised cost and fair value through profit and loss are disclosed 
in Note 44(a).
The Group’s financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includes investments which the Group had not irrevocably 
elected to classify at fair value through other comprehensive income.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for all debt instruments not held at fair value 
through profit or loss. ECLs are based on difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original 
effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit 
enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
 
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the 
Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date. 
The Group has performed its assessment based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking 
factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. In making this assessment, the Group also takes into 
consideration that it would maintain its name as the registered owner of the properties until full settlement is made 
by the purchasers or the purchasers’ end-financiers.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities of the Group and the Company are classified, at initial recognition, and financial liabilities at amortis ed 
cost.
The Group’s and the Company’s financial liabilities at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 44(a).
(p) Share capital and Islamic redeemable convertible preference shares (“RCPS-i A”, “RCPS-i B” and “RCPS-i C”)
Ordinary shares, RCPS-i A, RCPS-i B and RCPS-i C are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to deliver 
cash or other financial assets to another person or entity or to exchange financial assets or liabilities with another person 
or entity that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.
Ordinary shares, RCPS-i A, RCPS-i B and RCPS-i C are recorded at nominal value.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital.
Dividends on ordinary shares, RCPS-i A, RCPS-i B and RCPS-i C are recognised in equity in the period in which they are 
declared. 
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(q) Redeemable cumulative preference shares (“RCPS”)
Redeemable cumulative preference shares are classified as financial liabilities in accordance with the substance of the 
contractual arrangement of the RCPS. 
Dividends to shareholders of the RCPS are recognised as finance costs, on an accrual basis.
RCPS are measured at amortised cost.
(r) Revenue recognition 
(i) Revenue from property development
Contracts with customers may include multiple promises to customers and therefore accounted for as separate 
performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on 
the stand-alone selling prices. When these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost 
plus margin.
The revenue from property development is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the sale and purchase 
agreement.
Revenue from property development is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer 
and it is probable that the Group will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset 
that will be transferred to the customer. 
Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the asset may transfer 
over time or at a point in time. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the Group’s performance does not 
create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance 
completed to date.
This is generally established when:
– the promised properties are specifically identified by its plot, lot and parcel number and its attributes (such as its 
size and location) in the sale and purchase agreements and the attached layout plan, and the purchasers could 
enforce its rights to the promised properties if the Group seeks to sell the unit to another purchaser. The contractual 
restriction on the Group’s ability to direct the promised residential property for another use is substantive and the 
promised properties sold to the purchasers do not have an alternative use to the Group; and
– the Group has the right to payment for performance completed to date and is entitled to continue to transfer to 
the customer the development units promised and has the rights to complete the construction of the properties 
and enforce its rights to full payment.
If control of the asset transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the 
progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in 
time when the customer obtains control of the asset.
 
The Group and the Company recognise revenue over time using the input method, which is based on the actual cost 
incurred to date on the property development project as compared to the total budgeted cost for the respective 
development projects.
The Group recognises sales at a point in time for the sale of completed properties, when the control of the properties 
has been transferred to the purchasers, being when the properties have been completed and delivered to the customers 
and it is probable that the Group will collect the considerations to which it will be entitled to in exchange for the 
assets sold.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(r) Revenue recognition (cont’d)
(i) Revenue from property development (cont’d)
The Group has determined that it has a significant financing component related to the sales of its property units being 
developed under the deferred payment scheme (10:90 scheme). As a result of this the amount of the promised 
consideration is adjusted for the significant financing component and the related interest income is recognised using 
the effective interest method over the term of the deferment.
(ii) Revenue from construction contracts
Under such contracts, the Group is engaged to construct buildings and related infrastructure and in certain instances 
to supply equipments. These contracts may include multiple promises to the customers and therefore accounted for 
as separate performance obligations. The fair value of the revenue, which is based on fixed price under the agreement 
will be allocated based on relative stand-alone selling price of the considerations of each of the separate performance 
obligations.
The Group recognises construction revenue over time as the project being constructed has no alternative use to the 
Group and it has an enforceable right to the payment for performance completed to date. The stage of completion 
is measured using the input method, which is based on the total actual construction cost incurred to date as compared 
to the total budgeted costs for the respective construction projects.
(iii) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable and is recognised in 
profit or loss when the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of the goods have been transferred to 
the buyer.
(iv) Management fees
Management fees are recognised when services are rendered.
(v) Hotel operations
Revenue from hotel operations is recognised net of service taxes and discounts upon rendering of the relevant services 
or sales of goods. 
(vi) Recreational club operations
Revenue from recreational club activities including club membership fees and banqueting income are recognised when 
the services are rendered. The payment of the transaction price is due immediately upon delivery of the services. 
Recreational club membership fees which are received upfront are recognised on a straight-line basis over the tenure 
of the respective memberships.
The recognition of other classes of revenue/income are set out below:
(vii) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s and the Company’s right to receive payment is established.
(viii) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(r) Revenue recognition (cont’d)
(ix) Lease income
Lease income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The aggregate costs of incentives provided 
to lessees are recognised as a reduction of lease income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Other than the above, all other income are recognised on an accrual basis.
(s) Foreign currencies
(i) Functional currency
The financial statements of each entity within the Group are measured using their respective functional currencies.
(ii) Transactions and balances in foreign currencies
Foreign exchange differences arising on settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss 
except for monetary items that are designated as hedging instruments in a hedge of the Group’s net investment in a 
foreign operation.
(iii) Translation of foreign operations
For consolidation purposes, all assets and liabilities of foreign operations that have a functional currency other than 
RM (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of the foreign operations) are translated 
at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at exchange rates 
approximating those ruling on transactions dates. All exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign operations are dealt with through the exchange translation reserve account within equity. Upon 
disposal of a foreign operation, the related exchange translation differences will be recognised in profit or loss as part 
of gain or loss on disposal.
(t) Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Wages, salaries, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, maternity leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised 
as an expense in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees other than those that are 
attributable to property development activities or construction contract in which case such expenses are capitalised 
as part of the costs of the relevant assets.
(ii) Post-employment benefits
The Company and its subsidiary companies incorporated in Malaysia make contributions to the Employees Provident 
Fund (“EPF”) and foreign subsidiary companies make contributions to their respective countries’ statutory pension 
schemes. The contributions are recognised as a liability after deducting any contributions already paid and as expenses 
in the period in which the employees render their services.
(iii) Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates an equity-settled share-based long term incentive plan (“LTIP” or “Scheme”), which comprises the 
Employee Share Grant Plan (“ESGP”) and Employee Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) for its employees and Executive 
Directors.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(t) Employee benefits (cont’d)
(iii) Share-based payment transactions (cont’d)
ESGP
Employees and Executive Directors are entitled to ESGP in the form of Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) and Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”) as consideration for services rendered. The RSP is a restricted share plan for employees and Executive 
Directors, while the PSP is a performance share plan for selected senior management and Executive Directors.
The RSP and PSP are settled by way of issuance and transfer of new shares upon vesting. The total fair value of RSP 
and PSP granted is recognised as an employee cost with a corresponding increase in the share options reserve within 
equity over the vesting period after taking into account the probability that the RSP and PSP will vest. 
The fair value of RSP and PSP is measured at grant date, taking into account, if any, the market vesting conditions 
upon which the RSP and PSP were granted but excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-
market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest on the 
vesting date. 
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of RSP and PSP that are expected to vest on 
vesting date. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss and a corresponding 
adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. The equity amount is recognised in the share-based payment 
reserve.
ESOS
The ESOS allows the Group’s employees and Executive Directors to acquire shares of the Company. The total fair 
value of share options granted is recognised as an employee cost with a corresponding increase in the share options 
reserve within equity over the vesting period and taking into account the probability that the options will vest. 
The fair value of share options is measured at grant date using the binomial model, taking into account, if any, the 
market vesting conditions upon which the options were granted but excluding the impact of any non-market vesting 
conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to become exercisable on vesting date.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable on vesting date. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss and 
a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. The equity amount is recognised in the 
share-based payment reserve.
The fair value of the share options recognised in the share-based payment reserve is transferred to share capital when 
the share options are exercised, or transferred to retained earnings upon expiry of the share-based payment options.
The proceeds received net of any direct attributable transaction costs are credited to equity when the option are 
exercised.
(u) Borrowing costs
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group’s weighted average cost of borrowings after adjusting for borrowings 
associated with specific developments. Where borrowings are associated with specific developments, the amount capitalised 
is the gross interest incurred on those borrowings less any investment income arising on their temporary investment. 
Borrowing costs are capitalised until the asset is substantially completed for its intended use or sale.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
(v) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances, short-term deposits with licensed banks and other financial 
institutions which are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and 
which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and 
exclude sinking fund, debt service reserve, escrow accounts and short-term deposits pledged to secure banking facilities.
(w) Operating segments
Segment reporting in the financial statements is presented on the same basis as it is used by management internally for 
evaluating operating segment performance and in deciding how to allocate resources to each operating segment. Operating 
segments are distinguishable components of the Group that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues 
and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. 
Segment revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are those amounts resulting from operating activities of a segment that 
are directly attributable to the segment and a relevant portion that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment.
Segment revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are determined before intra-group balances and intra-group transactions 
are eliminated as part of the consolidation process, except to the extent that such intra-group balances and transactions 
are between group entities within a single segment. 
(x) Fair value measurement 
The Group measures financial instruments, such as quoted and unquoted securities and non-financial assets such as 
investment properties at fair value at each reporting date.
  
The Group’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value 
measurement.
External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as investment properties. Involvement of external value rs 
is decided upon annually by the management. Selection criteria of external valuers include market knowledge, reputation, 
independence and whether professional standards are maintained. The management decides, after discussions with the 
Group’s external valuers, which valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.
At each reporting date, the management analyses the movement in the values of assets and liabilities which are required 
to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Group’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the management verifies the 
major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other 
relevant documents.
For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy.
(y) Income tax
(i) Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted 
by the reporting date. Current taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items 
recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

(y) Income tax (cont’d)
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, based on at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and 
tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation 
authority.
(z) Derivative financial instrument and hedge accounting
The Group applies hedge accounting by way of hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which 
it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. 
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged 
and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including 
the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies 
for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: 
• There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. 
• The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship. 
• The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that 
the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that 
quantity of hedged item. 
Hedges of a net investment 
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part 
of the net investment, are accounted for in a way similar to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument 
relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised as other comprehensive income while any gains or losses 
relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, 
the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in equity is transferred to the statement of profit or loss. 
The Group uses loans as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign joint venture. 
Refer to Note 44(b) for more details.
(aa) Insurance contract
MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts is a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition 
and measurement, presentation and disclosure. MFRS 17 replaces MFRS 4 Insurance Contracts; MFRS 17 applies to all 
types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entity that 
issues them, as well as certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope 
exceptions will apply. The overall objective of MFRS 17 is to provide a comprehensive accounting model for insurance 
contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers, covering all relevant accounting aspects. MFRS 17 is based on 
a general model, supplemented by:
• A specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach)
• A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) mainly for short-duration contracts

to banks to secure the borrowings referred to in Note 27 below.
Included under the Group’s investment properties at the end of the financial year was borrowing costs of Nil (2022: RM494,000).
The fair value of the investment properties as at 31 December 2023 was substantially arrived at via valuations performed by 
certified external valuers.
Investment properties of the Group are measured at fair value except for investment properties under construction which are 
measured at cost until either the fair value becomes reliably determinable or when construction is completed, whichever is 
earlier.
The fair value hierarchy of the investment properties are disclosed in Note 45.
The Group has no restriction on the realisability of its investment properties and no contractual obligation to either purchase, 
construct or develop the investment properties or for repairs, maintenance and enhancements.
Significant judgement – Classification between investment properties and owner-occupied properties
The Group determines whether a property qualifies as an investment property and has developed certain criteria based on MFRS 
140 Investment Property in making that judgement.

4. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONT’D)
In making its judgement, the Group considers whether a property generates cash flows largely independently of other assets 
held by the Group. Owner-occupied properties generate cash flows that are attributable not only to the property, but also to 
other assets used in the production or supply process.
Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rental or for capital appreciation and another portion that is held for  
use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes. 
If these portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease), the Group accounts for the portion s 
separately. 
If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is accounted for as an investment property only if an insignificant 
portion is held for use in the production and supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes.
Judgement is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property 
does not qualify as an investment property.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Fair value of investment properties
The Group carries its investment properties at fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in profit or loss. The 
valuation methodology commonly used is the comparison method which is based on comparable historical transactions adjusted 
for specific market factors such as location, size, condition, accessibility and design of the respective properties and the investment 
method which entails determination of the net income applying suitable growth rates and capitalising of the net income by a 
suitable rate of return. 
Certain properties were valued based on the cost method which is based on current estimates of construction costs less 
depreciation, obsolescence and existing physical conditions of the respective properties.

6. INVENTORIES (CONT’D)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Allowance for stock obsolescence and inventories write down
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of inventori es 
based on an assessment of expected sales prices.
Inventories are reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will make an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories based 
primarily on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future product demand and related pricing. 
Demand levels, changes in product preference and pricing competition could change from time to time. If such factors result 
in an adverse effect on the Group’s products, the Group might be required to reduce the value of its inventories and additional  
allowances for slow moving inventories may be required.
During the financial year, the Group recognised a write-down of inventories amounting to RM2,179,000 (2022: RM16,325,000). 
The Group also recognised a reversal of previously written-down inventories amounting to RM3,111,000 (2022: Nil) due to 
improved project feasibility.
Significant judgement made in applying accounting policies – Capitalisation of borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowings cost during the period in which development activities are being undertaken or where there 
is on-going development activities which benefits an entire township. 
Significant judgement is involved in determining whether the development activities carried out meet the criteria of an active 
development in ascertaining whether or not borrowing costs incurred should be capitalised. Besides that, management is also 
required to estimate the appropriate apportionment of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation to the various development 
phases.

8. INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES (CONT’D)
During the year, RM3,771,830,000 of capital contribution to subsidiary companies have been converted into redeemable convertible 
preference shares (“RCPS”). The salient terms of RCPS in subsidiary companies are as follows: 
(i) The redemption of RCPS is solely at the discretion of the respective subsidiary companies;
(ii) The distribution to the holders of RCPS is at the discretion of the respective subsidiary companies; and
(iii) The conversion of RCPS into ordinary shares is fixed at one (1) RCPS for one (1) ordinary share. 
The capital contribution to subsidiary companies represents additional shareholders’ net investment. The capital contribution i s 
unsecured, interest free and the repayment of such balances are not expected in the foreseeable future. The amount, timing 
and method of repayment of these amounts if any are solely at the unconditional discretion of the subsidiaries.
Significant judgement – Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiary companies
At the reporting date, the Company reviewed its investments in subsidiary companies for indications of impairment and where 
such indications exist, the Company performed an impairment assessment to determine the recoverable amounts of such 
investments. The Company estimated the recoverable amount of the respective cash generating units (“CGU”s) based on their 
fair value less cost to sell or their respective value-in-use (“VIU”), whichever is higher. The recoverable amount is determined 
based on the higher of;
(i) Value in use, which is calculated using cash flow projections based on approved financial budgets, at a post-tax discount 
rate of 9% (2022: 8.5%) per annum;
 or
(ii) Fair value less costs of disposal (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy).
Estimating the VIU of the CGUs involved estimates made by management relating to the future cash inflows and outflows that 
will be derived from the CGUs, and discounting them at the appropriate rate. The cash flow forecasts included a number of 
significant judgements and estimates such as the timing of the project launches and sales, product pricing and costing and 
discount rate applied in the determination of VIU.
The review gave rise to the recognition of impairment losses of investments in subsidiary companies of RM196,188,000 (2022: 
RM487,020,000) as disclosed in Note 34 based on recoverable amounts of RM723,722,000 (2022: RM1,023,597,000). The impairment 
losses arose mainly because the subsidiaries either did not have viable business plans, have scaled down their business plans/
activities or have recorded a decline in value of their assets. 
In the previous financial year, the Company also recognised a reversal of impairment loss of RM22,260,000 of a certain subsidia ry 
due to improved financial performance.
The movements in the impairment losses during the financial year are as follows:

purchaser in return for an upside adjustment at the end of the fifth year following practical completion if the net operating 
income exceeds a prescribed yield and vice versa. This has given rise to significant insurance risk. No retrospective adjustment 
was made to prior year comparatives as the impact is not significant.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Recognition of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances and unutilised tax 
losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which the deductible temporary  
differences, capital allowances and tax losses can be utilised.
Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based 
upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. When an entity has a h istory 
of recent losses, the entity recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent t hat 
the entity has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit wi ll be 
available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised by the entity. 
15. DEFERRED TAX (CONT’D)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Recognition of deferred tax assets (cont’d)
The Group has recognised the deferred tax assets as it is probable that its development projects and its cost and efficiency 
rationalisation strategies would generate sufficient taxable profits in future against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised.
Unutilised tax losses, unabsorbed capital allowances and other temporary differences which exist as at 31 December on which 
deferred tax assets have not been recognised in the financial statements are as follows:
Group
2023
RM’000
2022

Unutilised tax losses 720,927 684,588
Unabsorbed capital allowances 53,603 43,658
Others – deductible temporary differences 79,465 68,913
853,995 797,159
Tax losses for which the tax effects have not been recognised in the financial statements:
Group
2023
RM’000

– Expiring in 2028 218,002 244,603

– Expiring in 2030 139,096 139,096
– Expiring in 2031 119,603 119,630
– Expiring in 2032 68,539 68,539
– Expiring in 2033 62,968 –
720,927 684,588
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items for certain subsidiary companies as it is not probable 
that taxable profits of the subsidiary companies would be available against which the unutilised tax losses, unabsorbed capital  
allowances and other deductible temporary differences could be utilised.
The unutilised capital allowances of the Group are available indefinitely for offsetting against future taxable profits of the respective 
entities within the Group, subject to no substantial changes in shareholdings of those entities under the Income Tax Act, 1967 
and guidelines issued by the tax authority. 
Based on the Malaysian Finance Act gazetted on 31 December 2021, the time limit for the carry forward of the unutilised tax 
losses is 10 years. 
The unutilised tax losses accumulated up to the year of assessment 2018 are allowed to be carried forward for 10 consecutive 
years of assessment (i.e. from years of assessment 2019 to 2028) and any balance of the unutilised losses thereafter shall be 
disregarded.
As for any unutilised tax losses that originated from the year of assessment 2019 onwards, these are allowed to be carried 
forward for a maximum period of 10 consecutive years of assessment immediately following that originating year of assessment 
and any balance of the unutilised tax losses thereafter shall be disregarded.
The foreign unutilised losses and unabsorbed capital allowances applicable to foreign incorporated subsidiary companies, if any , 
are pre-determined by and subject to the tax legislations of the respective countries.

construction contracts. The retention sums are due upon the expiry of the defect liability period stated in the respective sale  
and purchase agreements and construction contracts. 
Non-current gross progress billings receivables are due within 2 to 5 years and above (2022: 2 to 5 years). Current other gross

Receivables that are neither past due nor impaired
The receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment track records with the 
Group. None of the Group’s trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired have been renegotiated during the financial  
year except for an amount of RM9,729,000 which has been extended for a further 3 months during the year.
16. TRADE RECEIVABLES (CONT’D)
Receivables that are past due but not impaired
The receivables that are past due but not impaired are mainly related to the progress billings to be settled by the purchasers 
or the purchasers’ end-financiers. However, the Directors are of the opinion that these debts should be realised in full withou t 
material losses in the ordinary course of business as the legal title to the properties sold remains with the Group until the 
purchase consideration is fully settled/paid.
Receivables that are impaired
Trade receivables that are individually determined to be impaired at the reporting date relate to debtors that are in financial  
difficulties and have defaulted on payment. These receivables are not secured by any collateral or credit enhancements.
The Group measures allowance for impairment losses of trade receivables based on lifetime ECLs.
The expected credit losses on trade receivables are estimated by reference to historical loss experience of the debtors and an 
analysis of the debtor’s current financial position, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the gener al 
economic conditions, where applicable. The Group generally performs impairment assessment on trade receivables on an 
individual basis or on an account-by-account basis. In respect of its property development activities, the Group has assessed 
that these debts should be realised in full without material losses in the ordinary course of business as the legal title to th e 
properties sold remains with the Group until the purchase consideration is fully settled/paid.

The main features of the Scheme are as follows:
(a) The maximum number of new ordinary shares which may be made available under the Scheme at the point in time when 
an LTIP award is offered shall not be more than fifteen percent (15%) of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of

(where applicable) or such criteria as the NRC may deem fit subject to the following:
(i) that the number of new ordinary shares made available under the Scheme shall not exceed the amount stipulated in 
(a) above; and
(ii) that not more than ten percent (10%) of the total new ordinary shares to be issued under the Scheme at the point 
in time when an LTIP award is offered be allocated to any employee or Executive Director who, either singly or

The RCPS-i A issued by the Company to the shareholders are convertible at any time at the discretion of the holder commencing 
2 December 2016 (“Issue Date A”) up to such date no later than nine (9) market days prior to the relevant redemption date into 
such number of fully paid new S P Setia shares without payment of any consideration (cash or otherwise) and with the conversion 
ratio of two (2) new S P Setia shares for seven (7) RCPS-i A held. 
The Company may at any time on or after the 15th anniversary of the Issue Date A, at its discretion, redeem all (and not some 
only of) the outstanding RCPS-i A in cash at the redemption price which shall be the aggregate of the issue price of RM1.00, 
any preferential dividends declared but unpaid as at the redemption date and any Deferred Dividends A (as defined below) as 
at the redemption date.
 
Under the Constitution, the conversion ratio for RCPS-i A is subject to adjustments from time to time, at the determination of 
our Board, in the event of any alteration to our Company’s share capital, whether by way of rights issue, capitalisation issue, 
consolidation of shares, subdivision of shares or reduction of capital howsoever being affected, in accordance with the provisi ons 
of the Constitution. The conversion ratio for RCPS-i A had previously been adjusted to fifty (50) new S P Setia shares for one 
hundred sixty-nine (169) RCPS-i A held and subsequently readjusted to ten (10) new S P Setia shares for twenty-nine (29) RCPS-i 
A held, upon issuance of RCPS-i C. The effective date for the most recent adjusted conversion ratio was 3 November 2022.

(CONT’D)
RCPS-i A (cont’d)
The RCPS-i A confers on holders, the following rights and privileges:
(i) The right to receive preferential dividends, out of distributable profits of the Company earned from the first day of the 
calendar month following the Issue Date A (“Profits for RCPS-i A”) when declared and approved by the Board of the 
Company, at an expected preferential dividend rate of 6.49%. 
From the period commencing on and including the 15th anniversary of the Issue Date A until the redemption date, an 
additional stepped-up preferential dividend rate of 1.0% per annum above the expected rate abovementioned, shall be 
payable on the RCPS-i A on an annual basis, provided that the aggregate of the expected preferential dividend rate (including 
the stepped-up preferential dividends, if applicable) (“Expected Preferential Dividend Rate A”) shall not exceed a total rate 
of 20%. The maximum amount of preferential dividends that can be declared and paid on each preferential dividend 
entitlement date (“Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A”) shall be capped at such Expected Preferential Dividend Rate 
A unless otherwise decided by the Board of the Company.
On any preferential dividend entitlement date for RCPS-i A:
i. In the event that the Profits for RCPS-i A are lower than the Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A and the Company 
does not declare the preferential dividends up to the Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A (in whole or in part):
(a) The Company may, at its discretion, declare and pay any amount of preferential dividends up to an amount equal 
to the Profits for RCPS-i A as at such preferential dividend entitlement date. The amount of Profits for RCPS-i A 
declared as preferential dividends by the Company on a particular preferential dividend entitlement date, if any 
shall be referred to as (“Declared Sum A”); and
(b) The amount equivalent to the difference between the Profits for RCPS-i A as at such preferential dividend 
entitlement date and Declared Sum A, shall be cumulative (“Deferred Dividends A-1”), so long as the RCPS-i A 
remains unredeemed.
ii. In the event that the Profits for RCPS-i A are more than the Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A and the Company 
does not declare the preferential dividends up to the Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A (in whole or in part), 
the amount equivalent to the difference between the Expected Preferential Dividend Amount A and the Declared Sum 
A, shall be cumulative (“Deferred Dividends A-2”), so long as the RCPS-i A remains unredeemed.
Deferred Dividends A-1 and A-2 (as the case may be) (“Deferred Dividends A”) may be declared and/or paid, at the 
discretion of the Company, on any subsequent preferential dividend entitlement date for RCPS-i A, provided that the 
Cumulative Condition A (as defined below) is fulfiled on such preferential dividend entitlement date.
“Cumulative Condition A” of the RCPS-i A means on any preferential dividend entitlement date, the Company:
(a) has sufficient Profits for RCPS-i A that is at least equivalent to the aggregate of the Declared Sum A and any 
Deferred Dividends A accumulated as at and on such preferential dividend entitlement date;
(b) has maintained books and records that evidence the Company having Profits for RCPS-i A that is at least equivalent 
to the aggregate of the Declared Sum A and any Deferred Dividends A accumulated as at and on such preferential 
dividend entitlement date; and
(c) makes an announcement on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad that such amount of Deferred 
Dividends A on such preferential dividend entitlement date shall be cumulative.
Where there is no Profit for RCPS-i A available for the declaration and payment of dividends, the Company shall have 
no obligation to declare or distribute any preferential dividends on the relevant preferential dividend entitlement date 
for RCPS-i A. Such preferential dividends shall not be cumulative.
Each RCPS-i A holder will cease to receive any preferential dividends from and including the date the RCPS-i A is 
converted into new S P Setia shares save for preferential dividends declared but unpaid up to the date of conversion.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Revenue recognition of property development activities
The terms of the property development contracts and the laws that apply to these contracts, will determine whether the control 
of the properties sold is transferred and the corresponding revenue is recognised over time or at a point in time.
The Group recognises certain of its property development activities over time or based on the percentage of completion method 
using the input method which is based on the actual cost incurred to date on the property development project as compared 
to the total budgeted cost for the respective development projects.
Significant judgement is required in determining the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation and 
this includes determining the extent of property development costs incurred and the total estimated costs of property development, 
which in turn is used to determine the percentage of completion and gross profit margin of property development activities 
undertaken by the Group. In making these judgements, management relies on past experience and the work of specialists.

the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Pursuant to Finance Act 2021, a special one-off tax termed as “Cukai Makmur” or “Prosperity Tax” has been introduced for 
companies other than small and medium enterprise in Malaysia, where a 33% corporate income tax rate was levied on chargeable 
income exceeding RM100 million for the year of assessment 2022. There was no such special one-off tax in the current financial 
year.

298,606 200,006 10,759 10,297
The Company is on the single tier income tax system; accordingly the entire retained earnings of the Company is available for 
distribution by way of dividend without incurring additional tax liability.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s and the Company’s tax assets as at 31 December 2023 were RM32,943,000 and RM134,000 
(2022: RM49,631,000 and RM4,775,000) respectively.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s tax liabilities as at 31 December 2023 was RM104,762,000 (2022: RM50,458,000).
Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Income taxes
Significant judgement is involved in determining the capital allowances and deductibility of certain expenses during the estima tion 
of the provision for income tax. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group and the Company recognise liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will 
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differe nces 
will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
37. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share
The basic earnings per share for the year is calculated by dividing the Group’s profit attributable to owners of the Company 
adjusted for the effects of RCPS-i A and RCPS-i C (2022: RCPS-i A, RCPS-i B and RCPS-i C) preferential dividends declared for 
the year, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue as follows:

43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s and the Company’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk , foreign 
currency risk, liquidity and cash flow risks. The Group’s and the Company’s overall financial risk management objective is to 
minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company.
Financial risk management is carried out through risk review, internal control systems and adherence to the Group’s and the 
Company’s financial risk management policies. The Board regularly reviews these risks and approves the policies covering the 
management of these risks. The Group and the Company do not trade in derivative instruments.
(a) Interest rate risk
The Group and the Company are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that a financial instrument’s value will 
fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Group and the Company do not generally hedge interest rate risks. The Group and the Company have a policy to 
ensure that interest rates obtained are competitive.
Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk
The weighted average interest rate for bank borrowings of the Group and the Company are as follows:
Group Company
2023
%
2022
%
2023
%
2022
%
Weighted average interest rate 5.28 4.74 4.94 4.70
A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on the outstanding floating rate bank borrowings of the Group and the 
Company as at 31 December 2023. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 50 basis points with all other variables 
held constant, the Group’s and the Company’s profit before tax would decrease or increase by RM38,688,000 and 
RM26,026,000 (2022: RM37,150,000 and RM24,703,000) respectively. 
For those interest expense incurred and capitalised as part of the expenditure on property, plant and equipment under 
construction, investment property under construction, land held for property development and property development costs 
during the financial year, if the interest rates were to increase or decrease by 50 basis points with all other variables held 
constant, those assets of the Group would increase or decrease by RM11,994,000 (2022: RM16,788,000).
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or a customer contract, 
leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities.
The Group and the Company minimise and monitor its credit risk by dealing with creditworthy counter-parties and applying 
credit approval controls for material contracts. If necessary, the Group may obtain collaterals from counter-parties as a 
means of mitigating losses in the event of default.
In respect of trade receivables arising from the sale of development properties, the Group mitigates its credit risk by 
maintaining its name as the registered owner of the development properties until full settlement by the purchasers or the 
purchasers’ end-financiers.
At the reporting date, the Group did not have any significant concentration of credit risk that may arise from exposure to 
a single debtor or to group of debtors.
The ageing analysis of receivables which are trade in nature is disclosed in Note 16. Short-term deposits with banks and 
other financial institutions, and cash and bank balances that are neither past due nor impaired are placed with or entered 
into with reputable banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings and no history of default.

43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)
(c) Foreign currency exchange risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in foreign currency rates.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to various currencies, mainly Great British Pound, Australian Dollar, 
Singapore Dollar, Vietnamese Dong, United States Dollar, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen.
The Group maintains a natural hedge, whenever possible, by borrowing in the currency of the country in which the property 
or investment is located. 
The material unhedged financial assets/liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in their functional currencies are 
as follows:

Sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group’s profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in the 
GBP, AUD and USD exchange rates against the respective major functional currencies of the entities within the Group, with 
all other variables remaining constant:

The impact of sensitivity analysis of the rest of the foreign currencies is not material to the Group.
43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT’D)
(d) Liquidity and cash flow risks
Liquidity and cash flow risks are the risks that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations 
when they fall due. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables 
and borrowings.
The Group and the Company seek to ensure all business units maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times, sufficient 
for their operating, investing and financing activities.
Therefore, the policy seeks to ensure that each business unit, through efficient working capital management (i.e. inventory, 
accounts receivable and accounts payable management), must be able to convert its current assets into cash to meet all 
demands for payment as and when they fall due. 
Owing to the nature of its businesses, the Group and the Company always maintain sufficient credit lines available to meet 
their liquidity requirements while ensuring an effective working capital management within the Group and the Company.

as a hedge of the net investments in joint venture, Battersea group of companies, beginning 2023. This borrowing is being 
used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the GBP foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the 
retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation 
of the net investments in the Battersea group of companies in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 
There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a 
translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the GBP borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio 
of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. The hedge ineffectiveness 
will arise when the amount of the investment in the Battersea Group of companies becomes lower than the amount of 
the fixed rate borrowing. 
The impact of the hedging instrument on the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023 is, as follows:

45. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
The Group and the Company measure fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the 
inputs used in making the measurements:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either direct ly (i.e. 
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
(a) Non-financial assets that are measured at fair value

45. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (CONT’D)
(a) Non-financial assets that are measured at fair value (cont’d)
(ii) Description of valuation techniques used and key inputs to valuation on non-financial assets
The fair value of the investment properties was substantially arrived at via valuations performed by certified external 
valuers based on the following valuation techniques depending on the location and types of properties:
(a) Comparison method
The market comparison approach is a method whereby the property’s fair value is estimated based on comparable 
transactions. This approach is based upon the principle of substitution under which a potential buyer will not pay 
more for the property than it will cost to buy a comparable substitute property. In theory, the best comparable 
sale would be an exact duplicate of the subject property and would indicate, by the known selling price of the 
duplicate, the price for which the subject property could be sold. Investment properties valued under the 
comparison method, with insignificant adjustments factors, are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
Certain other investment properties valued using the comparison method with significant adjustments made for 
differences such as location, size, condition, accessibility and design (“adjustment factors”) are categorised as 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
(b) Investment method
The investment method entails determining the net annual income by deducting the annual ongoings from the 
gross annual income and capitalising the net income by a suitable rate of return consistent with the type and 
quality of the investment to arrive at the market value of the subject property.
The investment properties valued using this method is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
(c) Comparison/Depreciable Replacement Cost method
The comparison/cost method of valuation entails separate valuations of the land and buildings to arrive at the 
market value of the subject property. The land is valued by reference to transactions of similar lands in the 
surrounding areas with appropriate adjustments made for differences in the relevant characteristics of the land. 
Completed buildings are valued by reference to the current estimates on construction costs to erect equivalent 
buildings, taking into consideration of similar buildings in terms of size, construction, finishes, contractors’ overheads, 
fees and profits. Appropriate adjustments are then made for the factors of obsolescence and existing physical 
condition of the building.
The investment properties valued using this method is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Description of valuation techniques used and key inputs to valuation on investment properties are as below:
Valuation techniques Significant unobservable inputs Range
Land Comparison method Adjustment factors to prices of 
comparable properties 
-80% to 25%
Building Investment method Estimated rental value per square 
foot per month
Capitalisation/Discount rate
Void allowance
RM1.20 to RM40.00
3.50% to 7.75%
5.00% to 10.00%

The carrying amounts of all other financial assets and liabilities of the Group and the Company at the reporting date 
approximated or were at their fair values due either to their short-term nature or that they are floating rate instruments 
that are repriced to market interest rates on or near the reporting date. The fair values of the financial assets and financial 
liabilities above are determined using discounted cash flow method. The most significant input being the discount rate that 
reflects the credit risk of the counterparties.
There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the financial year.

48. PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES IN COMPARATIVES
In the current financial year, the Group has effected the following prior year adjustments in relation to the fair value model 
measurement basis for its investment properties:
(a) The Group has reassessed and made an adjustment to the carrying value of certain of its investment properties for which 
accrued lease income have been separately recognised in the statement of financial position. This adjustment is made in 
accordance with the requirements of MFRS 140: Investment Properties to reflect the carrying amounts of these investment 
properties at fair value. The effect of this adjustment is accounted for retrospectively as shown below.
(b) In prior financial years, the Group has sold a parcel of land to its joint venture, which had then accounted for the land a s 
an investment property. At that point in time, the Group’s policy was to recognise its investment properties at cost, and 
hence an unrecognised gain was recorded based on the Group’s equity interest in the said joint venture. The Group 
subsequently changed the accounting policy for its investment properties from the cost model to fair value model. Under 
the fair value model, the Group was to have made an adjustment for the realisation of the unrealised gain mentioned 
above. The effect of this adjustment is adjusted for retrospectively as illustrated below.
The financial effects of the abovementioned prior year adjustments and the change in certain comparative amounts to conform 
to the current year’s financial statements presentation of the Group are as follows:

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. O ur 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  
section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our 
audit opinion.
Independence and other ethical responsibilities
We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice ) 
of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (“By-Laws”) and the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (includ ing 
International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”), and we have fulfiled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance wit h the 
By-Laws and the IESBA Code.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financia l 
statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of th e 
financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that 
context.
We have fulfiled the responsibilities described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements  section of our 
report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respo nd 
to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, inclu ding 
the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis of our audit opinion on the accompanying financial 
statements.
Key audit matters in respect of the financial statements of the Group
(a) Revenue and cost of sales from property development activities recognised on percentage of completion method 
For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, revenue of RM4,064.70 million and cost of sales of RM2,754.59 million from 
property development activities account for approximately 93% and 91% of the total Group’s revenue and cost of sales respective ly. 
Where the Group uses percentage of completion method to recognise revenue and profit from its property development activities, 
the amount of revenue and profit recognised are dependent on, amongst others, the extent of costs incurred to the total 
estimated costs of construction to derive at the percentage of completion, the actual sales value of units sold and the estimated 
total revenue for each of the respective projects.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key audit matters in respect of the financial statements of the Group (cont’d)
(a) Revenue and cost of sales from property development activities recognised on percentage of completion method (cont’d)
We identified revenue and cost of sales recognised on percentage of completion method or over time from property development 
activities as matters requiring audit focus as these areas involved significant management’s judgement and estimates in estimat ing 
the total property development costs (which is used to determine the percentage of completion and gross profit margin of 
property development activities undertaken by the Group).
In assessing the appropriateness of the extent of costs incurred, total estimated costs of construction and total estimated rev enue 
collectively, we have:
– Obtained an understanding of the process in deriving the stage of completion which includes verifying the certified work 
done such as examining the progress claims from contractors, architect certification, and performing site visits on a sampling 
basis;
– Evaluated the assumptions applied in estimating the property development costs for property development phases on a 
sampling basis by examining documentary evidence such as letter of award issued to contractors and for amount not 
contracted for to consider the historical accuracy of management’s forecasts for the similar property development projects 
to support the budgeted costs;
– Verified the gross development value against the signed sales and purchase agreements and estimated selling prices of 
unsold development to transacted selling price on sampling basis; 
– Considered the expected handover date of ongoing development projects on a sampling basis to determine the adequacy 
of provision for liquidated ascertained damages, if any; and
– Checked the mathematical accuracy of the revenue and profit based on the percentage of completion calculations and 
considered the implications of identified errors and changes in estimates.
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures on property development activities based on percentage of completion method 
are disclosed in Notes 1(r)(i), 6, 30 and 31 respectively to the financial statements.
(b) Net realisable value of completed properties
As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of completed properties stood at RM1,752.19 million, which represents 18% of 
the Group’s total current assets. Completed properties are classified as inventories and are carried at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value. Management’s annual assessment of realisable value of completed properties is significant to our audit becaus e 
it is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market and economic conditions as well as the saleable conditio n 
of the property units which are slow moving, for which significant judgement is required. 
Our procedures in relation to management assessment of the net realisable value of completed properties include:
– Comparing the recent transacted prices of comparable completed properties, after taking into consideration the discount 
given. We focused our evaluation on those completed properties that are slow moving;
– Evaluated the appropriateness of the data used by the management as input into their determination of net realisable value. 
We interviewed the management, discussed and challenged the significant estimates and assumptions applied in their 
determination of net realisable value; and
– Physical sighting of completed properties on a sampling basis and assessed the related cost of maintenance to determine 
any potential write down due to physical obsolescence.
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures on completed properties are disclosed in Notes 1(k) and 6 respectively to the 
financial statements.
Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key audit matters in respect of the financial statements of the Group (cont’d)
(c) Valuation of investment properties
As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of investment properties amounted to RM2,026.42 million, representing approximately 
10% and 7% of the Group’s total non-current assets and total assets respectively. The Group had recognised a net fair value 
loss on its investment properties of RM20.23 million during the financial year.
Investment properties are stated at fair value and any gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value are included in prof it 
or loss in the year in which they arise. The Group has appointed independent professional valuers to perform valuations on its 
investment properties. The valuations are based on assumptions, amongst others, comparable historical transactions and 
adjustments factors to comparable transactions including location, size, condition, accessibility and design and market knowledge, 
estimated rental value per square foot, expected market rental growth, yield rate, outgoings rate, void rate, reversion rate an d 
discount rate.
We consider the valuation of the investment properties as an area of audit focus as such valuation involves significant judgeme nt 
and estimates that are highly subjective.
Our procedures to address this area of focus include, amongst others, the following:
– Assessed the objectivity, independence, reputation, experience and expertise of the independent valuers;
– As part of our evaluations of the fair values of investment properties, we had discussions with the independent valuers to 
obtain an understanding of their valuation process which included assessment of the comparability of historical transactions 
used and property related data used as input to the valuation models;
– We obtained an understanding of the adjustments factors made by the valuers or management to account for differences 
in, amongst others, the occupancy rate, property’s location, property’s size, the physical conditions of the subject property, 
tenure between the subject property and the comparable properties, and where applicable, the estimated construction costs 
to erect equivalent buildings;
– We also assessed whether the capitalisation rate used in the valuation models reflects the return that investors would requir e 
if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those 
that the entity expects to derive; and
– Reviewed the methodology adopted by the independent valuers or management in estimating the fair value of the investment 
properties and assessed whether such methodology is consistent with those used in the industry.
The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures on investment properties are disclosed in Notes 1(g) and 4 respectively to the 
financial statements.
Key audit matter in respect of the financial statements of the Company
(d) Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiary companies
As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary companies of the Company amounted to 
RM11,851.90 million, representing 78% and 70% of the Company’s total non-current assets and total assets respectively. The 
Company had recognised net impairment loss of investment in subsidiaries of RM196.19 million during the financial year.

Key Audit Matters (cont’d)
Key audit matter in respect of the financial statements of the Company (cont’d)
(d) Impairment assessment of investment in subsidiary companies (cont’d)
At the reporting date, the Company reviewed its investments in subsidiary companies for indications of impairment and where 
such indications exist, the Company performed an impairment assessment to determine the recoverable amounts of such 
investments. The Company estimated the recoverable amount of the respective cash generating units (“CGU”s) based on their 
fair value less cost to sell or their respective value-in-use (“VIU”) whichever is higher. Estimating the recoverable amounts based 
on VIU involved estimates made by management relating to the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the 
CGU and discounting them at the appropriate rate. The cash flow forecasts included a number of significant judgements and 
estimates such as the timing of project launches and sales, product pricing and costing, and discount rate.
We consider this to be an area of focus for our audit as the amounts involved are significant, the assessment process is comple x 
and involves significant management’s judgements about future market and economic conditions and changes in assumptions 
may lead to a significant change in the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary companies.
Our procedures to address this area of focus included, amongst others, the following:
– Obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls over the process of estimating the recoverable amounts of the 
CGUs;
– Evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology and approach applied;
– For impairment assessment based on VIU, we have:
• Checked the basis of preparing the cash flow forecasts taking into consideration the assessment of management’s 
historical budgeting accuracy; and 
• Evaluated whether key assumptions which comprised the timing of project launches and sales, product pricing and 
costing, and discount rate were reasonable by making comparisons to historical trends, taking into consideration the 
current and expected outlook of the economic growth.
– For impairment assessment based on fair value less cost to sell, where applicable, we have: 
• Where applicable, if the management obtain valuation reports provided by independent valuers, assessed the objectivity, 
independence, reputation, experience and expertise of the independent valuers;
• Reviewed the methodology adopted in estimating the fair value of the assets and assessed whether such methodology 
is consistent with those used in the industry; and
• Evaluated the appropriateness of the data used as input of the valuations. We interviewed the management or independent 
valuers where applicable, discussed and challenged the significant estimates and assumptions applied in their valuation 
process.
– Analysed the sensitivity of the key assumptions by assessing the impact of changes to the key assumptions on the recoverable 
amount.
We also reviewed and assessed the Company’s disclosures relating to the impairment of assessment of investment in subsidiary 
companies in Note 8.
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon 
The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Director’s Report, but 
does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon, which we obtained 
prior to the date of this auditors’ report, and the annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after the date of this 
auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not 
and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
Information other than the financial statements and auditors’ report thereon (cont’d)
In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the oth er 
information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the finan cial 
statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstat ed.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, w e 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to 
report in this regard.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate th e 
matter to the directors of the Company and take appropriate action.
Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that 
give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the dir ectors 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from mat erial 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going 
concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or  
have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved 
standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reason ably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we 
exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether d ue 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is highe r 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the o verride 
of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in  the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Company’s internal 
control.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosur es 
made by the directors.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit eviden ce 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s or 
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to dra w 
attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if  
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue 
as a going concern.

Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, includi ng 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities withi n the 
Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and 
performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant aud it 
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,  
and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the  
financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely 
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of 
doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not  
acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Other matters
This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 
in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.
